{"reviews":["Great bar by my house.   The food is always good and the waiters do a great job.  They have a glass mexican cup you can buy for margaritas and you get MORE for a lower price if you bring the cup back with you.","I'm sure there have been plenty of reviews for Macayo's Mexican food.  It's a very popular and reasonably priced place to get a good meal.  They have a nice atmosphere for large groups as well.  There have been many many evenings after bike riding in circles for about 2 hours when the bike bunch went for tacos and chimis to refuel..... but the BEST thing on the menu after a long hot ride for my money is the frozen Raspberry Margarita.\n\nMacayo's sells the first jumbo margarita in large politically inappropriate mugs that look like ethnic stereotype effigies.  These can be brought back for refills of the frozen salty sweet drink each visit.  In my opinion, they are well worth it....","At atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Prices were not bad. Food great.","Great for a happy hour on a Friday. But as far as the food, do not come here expecting authentic mexican food. It's sorta TexMexStyleWithFastFoodCharm if u get my drift. But the prices are reasonable if u wanna drink a margarita out of the chichi cup on a fri fri :)","You know how you wake up some mornings hungry for a big, delicious Chile Relleno?  Ok, never mind.\n\nAnyhow, I came here for lunch today, a first visit to this Macayo's location.  It's beautiful inside, & a completely comfortable place to eat.  The service was top notch, as has been the case for me at all of the Macayo's except Tempe.  After munching on some of their warm, thick, delicious chips with tasty, chunky style red salsa, it was on to my choices from their \"Mex & Match\" menu, starting with a cup of their terrific Tortilla Soup.  Then for the rest, I had that Chile Relleno, along with a great shredded been taco, & mixed veggies.  Even the veggies were especially good.\n\nThis is 'Gringoized' fake Mexican food, you say?  Fine.  Both the salsa & the big Pablano chile were mild, so you're right.  It was a totally fake, but nevertheless a totally 5-Star feast for $8.79!!  \"Woohoo!\"  ...as we Gringos say!     :-))","This is one of my favorite places to eat. The only downside to eating here is you get really stuffed every time. Its authentic Tex-Mex at its finest. \nI have eaten here about 10 - 12 times (My business partner lives in Scottsdale) and I look forward to Macayo's whenever I am in town for business or pleasure.","I know Macayo's isn't authentic but it is damn good! The chips and salsa here are great I always ask for their hot sauce because its better than the mild. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I recommend ordering something with baja sauce. It's amazing and I always order a side of it with my meal. I love the food but this restaurant needs to be remodeled. The carpet is old and the tables are worn out. At least keep your restaurant up to date when you are charging $12 an entree.","Had the misfortune of doing taxes on Saturday and needed a drink and a nice place to sit and reflect on how much my husband and I got rapped by our government.  He wanted a Margarita and I thought of this place.  We wanted something not fufu which had a bar and some fatty apps.  \nWe drove not to far from our house and walked in.. My first time to this Macayos and thought it was a lot smaller then the location in downtown and off bell...  Pretty much same theme, Mexican, same menu, Mexican.  \nWe sat outside on the patio off the bar and our bartender took our orders..  We also had ordered two apps, a nacho platter, and a Mexican pizza.  It was nice chilling outside, it was a perfect day outside.  Our service was excellent, now onto the food.  \nThe nachos weren't anything I would ever order again..  Basic stuff on it.. Beans, cheese, chips, gauc., sour cream, and huge chucks of chicken, I mean big, the size of jawbreakers... Kinda difficult eating without some sort of fork to break it down.. The chips got soggy kinda quick.  I just wasn't all into them.  Now the pizza on the other hand I would've and should've ordered another.  It was really just a plate of yumminess.   The queso was so good, and the flavors just bursted in my mouth.  Prices were a little high for apps, like the prices of the main meals.  Quick service, close to home, yes, if I must have a quick drink I would come back.","First off, let me say I love Macayo's and have tried many locations.\n\nNow, this is not my favorite location and I'll tell you why.\n \nThe restaurant itself is older than some locations, and it has not been redecorated. That's fine but I know there's better. The parking lot is a little sketchy, especially at night. \n\nThe food comes out usually pretty tasty, but the quality could be a step up. I ordered dinner to go one night, and came early to pick it up so I went to the bar for a margarita which was on happy hour. The bartender tried to get me to order a patron margarita for like $7 more than the happy hour marg. I didn't appreciate that. When I ordered the $3 one, I was pretty much ignored after that. I had told the hostess I would be waiting in the bar for my food, and she also never came to let me know it was ready. After sitting there 20 minutes, I went and asked. It had been sitting on their counter for who knows how long. Once I got home (only a 3 min drive), my order was correct, but the food was lukewarm. Disappointing. \n\nOn a different occasion, it was fajita fest or something, and I ordered a combo fajitas and I was overcharged. I pointed out on the menu exactly where it said the price and I had to ask for the manager because my server didn't want to adjust the bill accordingly. \n\nAnother time I went for dinner and my server was mostly absent, but the bus boy was awesome and completely took care of us. When our server showed up at the end to drop off the bill after disappearing for 20 min, we mentioned we wanted dessert. 10 min later he came back to say the fryers were already off and we couldn't get anything for dessert that was hot. The manager took care of the situation and offered me a comp card for next time, which was definitely sufficient and appreciated.\n\nBut that's why I only give 3 stars.  Love the food, but I'll usually drive farther for a better location. 60th ave and bell is the best imo.","3.5 really but it's not allowed. Servers are usually prompt and attentive. If you like hot salsa you have to ask for it. The chicken poblano is well seasoned and stuffed with finely shredded chicken. For a delicious vegetarian option ask for spinach enchiladas...not on the menu but still available . Typically there is not a wait and the food comes out piping hot;) not a whole lot super special to set macayos in a category of it's own but it's good flavor, prompt and consistent service and the margaritas are not bad either ;)","Macayo's is comfort food.  They'v kept the same menu for years with good service.  You know what you will get and that you will have leftovers.  It's also fun to browse the Goodwill in the parking lot after eating.  Cheese crisp is crisp like it should be - not soft.  Beef taco is a meal in itself.","Yummy!  I had the Baja Burro...it was heaven.  The jalapeno cream cheese was drizzled over my yummy deep fried chimichanga.\n\nVery tasty.  Great Service too.  Went on a Saturday night but by the time we were done....the restaurant was filling up with patrons.","Good burritos an even better margaritas!","This location is not the best example of macayo's. My wife and boys love mexican food and I'm always game - usually macayo's puts on a good meal at decent prices and that's why this was a place we would visit once every month or two...not anymore. Service was okay - no problems there, however the food quality has fallen off a bit. Salsa was great - chips ehhh - dry and salty. Over the years I've had everything on this menu and it's hasn't changed - except for the smaller portions paired with a plate full of bland rice and beans...Chimi was small and I was amazed how little chicken was inside it...it was okay but, I was looking for more food and flavor.  The bill for two adults and two kids 50-60 bucks - too expensive for a marginal meal.\n\nNot not impressed anymore with the food here, especially when prices are up and we want a bang for our buck in this economy...\n\nHaven't been to the one in scottsdale in a while but, I was very happy there - much better than thunderbird...","Best imitation Mexican food in AZ the spinach con queso and the baja chicken chimi are my favorites. Although I'm about 75% sure they gave me food poisoning awhile back.","The only thing I can say about Macayos is \"meh\". I was unimpressed by my tacos, the queso was good and my husband loved his margarita. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, even if over worked and under staffed. I would imagine they are great for a more family fun enviroment and less on the night out with your friends or \"date night\" experiences.","My meal at Macayo's was decent.  I tried the Mex and Match with a shredded beef taco and carnitas enchilada.  It came with beans and rice.  The shredded beef taco was good but nothing to write home about.  A taco of the same quality can be found at any local Mexican joint.  Just throw a rock and you'll find a taco just as good.  The carnitas enchilada was not to my taste.  Macayo's must have a house marinade or seasoning and I didn't care for it.  Not horrible but I would refrain from ordering their carnitas selections in the future.\n\nStaff was friendly and my drinks were refilled without any effort from myself and the atmosphere is good.\n\nIt is not, however, a \"must go\" for Mexican.  You'll find food of the same or better quality elsewhere and for less cost as well.  I would say Macayo's is good for groups or if you have visiting friends and family that are averse to eating at fabled & filthy hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints.","I did not want to eat here I know better but sigh it's not always my choice. Nothing special here at all except for currently you can super size your margs for just pennies more. The pomerita on the menu is the only marg thats made with Cazadores very yummy hekk yes I say way worth it!! The salsa was eh with no heat or any real taste, this became the theme with the rest of the food through out the night. Spinach con queso was ok. I had the carnitas and the only thing I could taste was salt and way too much of it. Guacamole, rice and beans were pretty bland. Again, I didnt come in with high hopes but this dinner was something I wont be repeating chain or not I still have standards for good tasting food and this has not been it for ages. Sorry 2 stars here for drinks.","We went this past Friday during Happy Hour, and all I kept asking myself was \"are we in Sun City?\"\n\nIt was dead in the bar area for a long time, until a group of older folks came in with their Macayo's margarita glasses. There were a few patrons who were obviously perturbed by myself and my co-workers; we kept on getting dirty looks throughout our time there. Hey, it's happy hour on Friday - we weren't trying to be quiet - especially in the bar area.\n\nThe only reason I gave this location 3 stars is because the server was very nice and accommodating. The food was just average. The drinks were strong!","Chimichanga!\nIt's fun to say, it's even better to eat and Macayo's has some of the best.\n\nWe were out and about and dropped in here on a whim for lunch. The decor is a bit too \"touristy-Mexican\" for my taste but the place is clean and well maintained. \n \nThe service is excellent and everyone is very friendly and the refills kept coming.\n\nI had the chimi sampler plate.  You get a total of six two-bite chimis (2 each - chicken, pulled pork and beef) smothered with cheese, some sour cream on the side and guacamole.  I also had a side of rice. Damn! Those are some tasty chimis - crisp on the outside and oh so good on the inside!  My wife had a chicken chimichanga that came with rice or beans and she said it was also very good.","A family member graduated and a dinner was held at Macayo's afterwords to celebrate. We arrived a little early for our reservation, but the staff was quick to set up our area and we were seated within minutes. Our waiter was great, drinks were never empty before a new one showed up.\n\nI ordered the combo platter because their menu is so huge I couldn't pick what I wanted! The two things that stood out most were the red corn chicken taquitos, crispy and great flavor, and the green corn tamale bites. Oh my gosh. These things are so amazing I might just have to go back for more. The outside is fried and crispy, but not hard. More like a panko breading. The inside is full of melted cheese or some kind of white sauce and it's spicy but almost sweet and creamy, unlike anything I've ever had. I could go on and on about these, but if you ever go please just try them!\n\nEverything was great, our party was happy and left a little too full.","Well, I have eaten at the location on central downtown, I have noe eaten at another one. I currently find myself displeased at this locale vs centrals locale. They didn't listen to what I ordered. I ordered enchiladas, they tried to bring tacos, I ordered beans and rice, only got rice. To much of hassle to bring another plate...waitress was nice, my actual server, a guy waited on the ladies longer and just walked by me and tapped me on shoulder asking, how is it? By the time I looked up he was walking over to his friends for more chatting.","I like the food here very much, always have. I also believe they have the best Margaritas in town. Its the service that is remarkably below average. I should try visiting them during non-peak hours, perhaps the service would improve then.","So yesterday we had a going away luncheon for a coworker who is leaving today and we all went to Macayo's for lunch.  We had a group of 20 people so sometimes this can be a challenge but we called ahead and they said they would take care of us no problem.\n\nSo we arrive and the tables are all setup and everything started out great all the drink orders and getting us situated.  \n\nWe were checking out the new summer menu and a group of us decided to try the habenero lime hot wings.  So they brought them out and no habenero sauce on them what so ever.  I asked about this to our server and he said habenero is sweet and it's on there.  LOL WOOOOOOOOOW I couldn't believe this guy just said this it is one of the hottest peppers on earth.  He said well other people like them so not sure what to say other than I can bring buffalo sauce.  LOL \n\nNext came main courses a coworker next to me had her order totally wrong twice before the 3rd time it was finally right.  My street tacos were tiny and more of an appitizer than a entree like they were listed.  \n\nSo overall this will be my last trip to Macayo's and hopefully my review saves some people from a meal that they regret.","Although I think that the food was better years ago before they became a moderately sized chain, I still enjoy Macayo's.  This is a good  compromise if you are in mixed company with friends/family that may not be ready for \"authentic\" Mexican/Southwestern.  This location in particular has a lot of character aesthetically.","This is your typical large Mexican place.\n\nMost of the food is boring, and identical to every other place like it.\n\nHowever, that being said...\n\nThere are a few gems on the menu.\n\nThe BBQ Chipotle tacos are very, very good. The pork is very tasty with these. \n\nThey also recently added pork nachos to the menu, and it is very good as well. Chips, cheese, black beans, and pork. It also has a moderately spicy green salsa mixed in that adds a perfect amount of heat to the dish.\n\nMy wife really enjoys the California Burro.\n\nThe side items (rice, beans, etc) are plain, and boring to be honest.\n\nThe service is typically good, the wait staff remembers us. The chips and salsa are also quite good.","Wow. Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. Sure, it's not a hole in the wall, and the menu is pretty standard. But, the quality is fantastic. I had the chimichanga, nachos, and taquitos. Wow. The guacamole is on point as well. Our server did a great job with us (party of 12). He was quick to refill drinks and explain various menu items. Highly recommended.","The food was great and staff was very pleasant!","Though I've always been pleased there in the past, tonight  was most unpleasant.  It was incredibly hot and stuffy which they blamed on the \"humidity.\"  What happened to air conditioning?  It took a half hour to get chips.  Our orders took even longer and were not correct.  We didn't send them back simply because we didn't have the time.  I hope this is an isolated incident.  I would hate to lose a favorite restaurant.","This place is awesome ! No where can you find a place , buy the cute ceramic margarita cups and bring back for cheap huge refills ! I havnt had the food , only margaritas (that's why only 4 stars) ... We will keep returning for our refills and friendly bartenders ;)","The customer is not always right but when u pay for something it should be what u ordered.Not something u didnt want then asked if its ok,then attitude when i say no thats not what i wanted,then brought me the comepletly wrong thing after that.I went to this location on a tuesday night not very busy and had the worst service and over all experience ever at a restaurant. I could write an essay on everything that happened that made me feel this way but I just want to save u time and NOT go to this location! I will never ever recommend someone here.","I just realized I did not review this place when I visited back in June of 2012.  See, I had my first  official date here way back then with my now  fiancé. For kicks and giggles, we decided to go back to where it all began. We even sat in the same booth and order the same meal ( me being fish tacos and him being the baja burrito) . We ate so many chips and salsa that I was surprised that we actually at our meal but the food was as good as I remember. The waitress, Brandi was awesome but I must say that the company I was with was fabulous and it was so much fun reminiscing about our first date. Tons of fun revisiting and I know we will be back again soon.","Food is average at best and they charge extra for everything that should come with your plate already. Other locations are better but your better off picking a different Mexican food restaurant all together. It is phoenix, so there's plenty of other Mexican food spots that will serve you much better food at a much better price.","It had been a few years since I was last here and had enjoyed the food. So when my friend picked this place for her Birthday lunch I was excited to go. The place wasn't crowded which was nice. Our waitress was very friendly. I ordered a chile relleño and red chile cheese enchilada with refried beans. Although the portions were great they were very bland. No kick from either chile. Even adding salt didn't help. I was disappointed in the lunch. I will go back one more time to make sure it wasn't an off day. But if not I will never go again.","Decided to try a new place ,so we came here. We're seated and waited on quickly. Ordered two patron margaritas and cheesy crisp with green chile. Salsa and chile very mild but not bad. I ordered burro favorito carnitas red enchilada style. My wife had combo platter. Besides the mild chili it was awesome great flavor and good size plate. My wife loved the combo platter and these bite size what I can only explain as a ball were great tasting had oozing cheese and pieces of green chili fried in a crust. And our server Patrick was the best server we have had at any restaurant we have been to. Friendly, attentive, and alway\nMade sure we liked everything and that we were doing good. So if you come here you might want to look for this guy. Great customer service."],"business_id":"0_3hrGrrP-J5eeHRwQfZ6w","name":"Macayo's Mexican Kitchen","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["This place is literally a shack and hole in the wall place, but it has the BEST red and green chile burritos in all of QC. They are huge. One will do you although you will want to eat more. Go there today!","A friend of mine will occasionally bring burritos from this place to work, so I've nibbled on their food occasionally.  I wasn't overfond of their bean burrito, but their 6 Pound Burrito, served enchilada style? -Yum- and I'm not even all that fond of green chille.\n\nAs Matt S. said, it's literally a shack. But who cares? They've got really good burritos.","You've probably seen this place a lot if you drive on Power Rd at all and always wondered if it was legit (given the sign streetside usually always says open).  I was one of those folks as well.\n\nIt's changed ownership a few times is what the local story has it, but the current owners are kind folks who are cranking out burritos, grande style.\n\nI've been there a few times opting for the carne asada/potato, chorizo/egg/bean burrito options  Chorizo for me is a benchmark.  Burrito Shack didn't blow me away with the chorizo offering, it was good, but not great.  Return visits will have me sticking with a variation including carne asada.\n\nThe burritos are large...you can split one with someone if you want.  I'm not sure why restaurants feel the need to wrap everything in a 36-inch tortilla, but the Shack is no different.  Just prepare yourself.  Cut it in half to start to save the rest for later...unless you are muy hungry.\n\nThe name states the ambience.  It's a shack.  That covered stuff you see -- it's like the covered parking in a medical parking lot...not enclosed.  If it's cold outside, the Shack will be cold because, well, you're outside.  There is no 'inside' dining.  This is fine by me and I love the 'get your food and find a chair that isn't broken' type places.\n\nSo stop passing the sign by, pull in and grab some burrito.","This place was amazing, the beans are full of flavor, the meat is tender and succulent, plus if you go to A.S.U its only a 10 minute walk away so whenever you hungry just walk your self over and your guaranteed the best burrito!","Wow, I almost feel bad rating this only 2 stars since everyone else rated it so highly, but honestly, I was NOT impressed and I will NOT be back.\n\nI drive by here ALL the time, and have always thought, \"if a SHACK can stay in business, it MUST be good!\"  Well perhaps I had too high of hopes for a shack afterall.\n\nI ordered the chicken burrito (my staple at any fast food mexican place), and I was surprised when the girl taking my order said there were beans, cheese and pico inside along with the chicken, but I figured, hey, I'll try it since that's how they make it.... and again, if a shack of a business stays open, they must know what they're doing.\n\nWell, after taking my first bite, I realized that I not only was I glad that there were beans, cheese and pico, but it was actually the best part of the burrito.  Although this was a \"chicken burrito\" - the chicken itself was dry and tasteless and totally ruined the burrito.  I ended up picking out most of it and just eating a \"bean, cheese & pico burrito\" instead.\n\nAnother gripe, they gave me their \"hot sauce\" along with the burrito, and similar to the chicken, it was bland and tasteless.  Wouldn't call it mild, much less hot.\n\nSigh...  Very disappointing meal I must say.","Drove by this place & was intrigued but filed it away. Then, minutes later other relatives who had also driven past it mentioned it so we decided to give it a try based on previous reviews.\nUm, YUM! Between the 8 of us we had quite a sampling of the menu and no one had a single complaint. Carne Asada burrito was the best!\nSuper inexpensive and huge portions!\nOnly 4 stars because it took them 10 mins to give us our drinks and an additional 20 mins before the food was ready.\nThey ran out of chili beef and comped us some chips but it was still a disappointment to those who really wanted it.\nWe will definitely be back the next time we visit the parents!","Wow, I'm still the only person that doesn't like this place?? I don't get it. What am I missing? Oh I know... FLAVOR. \n\nGave this place a 2nd try and was even more disappointed than the first time. Got a breakfast burrito with eggs, beans, cheese (supposedly), and green chilies. I may as well have had a piece of cardboard. Seriously, NO FLAVOR. I poured their salsa and hot sauce all over it and I barely noticed it (they use the word \"hot\" very liberally). \n\nPerhaps if I ate meat other than chicken I'd like the food here, but both the chicken burrito I had the first time and the breakfast burrito I had today were tasteless, so 2 strikes and you're out on this one.","Mmmmm.... Yum. carne asada is the only way to go.  Chicken... well tastes kinda like everything else, Chicken.  And if you want to feed the family, Grab a Shack Attack! I would say it's the whole enchilada, but it's not. It's a whole lot of burrito.","Only order the lunch menue. Breakfast is not quite as good. Great Pork. Bring your friends, you will be thanked...","The Colorado burrito is the best and what great beef tacos! The location is a little inconvenient as they share a small parking lot with 2 other businesses bit the food is. Awesome!","Went back to this location to give it another chance and I was beyond blown away of how delicious the breakfast burrito aka known as \"the works\" was. I most definitely will become a regular customer. I was also impress on how the owner made sure we were taken care of when we went today. Mmmmmm good!!! =-P","I eat at the Shack at least once a week.\nI'll be the first to admit that the exterior of the Shack kept me away for a long time.  I'm a pretty big food snob, so I judge the proverbial book by the proverbial cover and didn't go.\nIt wasn't until a friend took me by the hand and personally escorted me to the Shack that I discovered the gem it is.  Now I'm hooked.  The breakfast burritos have become our whole office's regular Friday tradition,and I'm typically there for a lunch or two during the week.\nThe food is fresh, Kurt and Peggy, the owners, become family after just a visit or two, and the ambiance really begins to grow on you.  It's eclectic!\nGive the Burrito Shack a try.  You won't be sorry!!","One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the East Valley.  The only complaint that I have is that they are only open until 2pm.  I brought my fiance there and she swore she would never eat anything made in what appeared to be a tin shack.  It is now one of  her favorite places to grab a Saturday lunch!  I just wish you were open later so we could eat there more than once a week!","So, I refused to go eat there for almost a year but, one day my boyfriend decided to take me in because he use to work for the owners at their previous business. At first I was alittle sketched out but to my suprise it was awesome! It was a great deal for the money and, now I go there every chance I get! If you haven't been you should totally try it out. I've been going there long since I dumped him haha. Don't be scared, it's the shack!","My waistline doesn't want to admit it, but I am a regular here, coming in about once every week to two weeks. I love the Colorado red chili, the green chili pork, the carne asada, their hot salsa, Cali burrito....really, the list goes on and on. The burritos are huge and really reasonably-priced. Everyone that works here is super friendly and most days when I pick up my order, someone is sitting there chopping away at delicious fresh onions, tomatoes, peppers for the various dishes. They have a very extensive menu and I really need to try some of the tacos and other items but the burritos are just so darn good! Their patio is covered and not very large but we usually just order ours for pick up and eat at home. I have never been there when there wasn't some form of line but the wait isn't all that long for the food. \n\nThey have free wi-fi, amazing, quality ingredients, they don't skimp on the meat and fillings in the burritos, either. I will definitely keep coming here.","Really good carne asada fries.","I've been passing this place daily for 3 years. Finally stopped in for a chorizzo burrito. What a mistake. Now I know that the best breakfast burrito in the world is right there waiting. Time to either change my commute route or buy bigger clothes.\nI would have stopped years earlier, but from the street it looks a bit scary.  That's obviously by design, and I wouldn't let that stop you if you have been considering trying it out.","DO IT!  Put aside any reservations you may have about this little shack and go ahead and give it a shot.  It's a super cute place and it seems like it may be family run and has a very friendly vibe.  I went here after urgings from my friends and I'm so glad I did!  \nToday is Cinco de Mayo and one of their specials was Cinnamon crisps with fruit salsa and dip (they sold me with a free sample).  DEEELISH!! Seriously, my hungover husband couldn't eat much, but he sure was able to scarf this down.  The fruit salsa is like pureed strawberries and other fruit and it was perfection.  My husband said he could have drank it, it was that good.  I'm glad we gave it a shot since I don't think it's regularly on the menu, but maybe we can petition for it to be a permanent menu addition...\nI had a carne asada burrito, the carne is good chunks of tasty meat and the tortilla was great.  My husband got the carne asada fries which were pretty basic but not as exciting as the ones he used to always get in LA with his buddies.  All in all, I'll definitely be back, and I actually want to eat there instead of doing take out... at least before it gets too hot.  The ambiance is really cute and laid back.  I'll be back for breakfast!","I came across Burrito Shack on accident.... I was really hungry and just happened to drive by... I was scared at first by the looks of the building but it was all worth it. \n\nSadly, their food is too good and I can't stop going... I recommend the Carne Asada Fries!","C'mon folks. Anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly.\n\nThis is about on par with Filibertos except in a much dirtier environment. Dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating. This is a very LDS style hodge podge of a dining area. Whatever could be found at the Thrift store if I had to guess.\n\nNice people working there though. Don't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town. People in this part of AZ are very very dry.","I really like this place. Probably because of the location: about two miles from my house, the owners: just friendly good people, the clientele: construction workers, crusty old guys, I'm not sure I've ever seen another woman there now that I think of it...They make a big, inexpensive, good burrito. My oldest boys loves the breakfast burrito with potatoes and bacon. And I mean bacon. Real, huge, chunks of delicious bacon. Man bacon. It's delicious. Not that I've ever gotten one of these because women have no business eating huge, bacon burritos right? Yeah. That's it. Never. \nOn to girly food: green chile pork is delish. My younger boys always loves the bean & cheese.  And it's awesome on the way to the lake in the morning. \nDid I mention it really is a shack?? Really Really.","LOVE THIS PLACE! It's literally a shack, not much to look at, but don't let that fool you! I love the Mexican food here, it is scrumdidallyumpshious! Prices are cheap and you get a ton of food! My favorite is their Carne Asada Burrito! Stuff full with steak, beans, pico, guacamole.... my tummy is very happy after eating here! I got my food baby on (huge full tummy that makes me look pregnant) then I went back to work and tried to concentrate while in a bliss of food comaness! Great little spot for a quick bite!","One of my favorite places when I went to ASU Poly. I drove by it daily 5x a week for a whole semester but never stopped. It was not until my last final I had some time to kill beforehand and I was starving at 9am. Think I got a ham breakfast burrito (ham, potatoes, cheese, onions, tomatoes). It was soo good I scarfed it down, which was a bad idea to stuff myself before my final. \n\nSo I didn't return again until the following semester and dropped by almost weekly. These times I pretty just ordered the basic bean and cheese burrito. Just the sheer size for $2 was great, but again added my \nfree (L, O, and T) and made it taste even better. I didn't mind the setting, free water, and parking because my filling lunch was less than $3 with tax. I liked the owners, the lady was always nice and remembered my order.\nI do miss this place because my major did get switched to downtown and then graduated. If I didn't live 30 miles away I would definitely be a regular again.","Love burrito shack. Don't ever let the looks of it fool you. Great food, nice people and did I mention great food?!?!\n\nI was skeptical about going to the Burrito shack at first, but once I did I get it pretty often. I have not tried many things because I am stuck on one burrito because it is so good. The service is always friendly and even when the wait is long they still get your food to you as fast as possible and my order is always correct.","PHENOM place for breakfast, and great for lunch.  They close at 2 pm!","Really good food and a good selection.  The shack burro is great!","The works breakfast burrito with a bag of chips and salsa! Ohh yeah!!","Their enchiladas [red] rival some of the best New Mexican food I've had...and I'm a multi- generation New Mexico native born and raised .  I crave their red chile.  \n\nOnly occasionally in the area for work related reasons (I have an office/Fire Center at Mesa-Gateway Airport) I have no issue eating lunch there every other day while working there.  But when I get a craving and I am not wanting to cook it myself and I am not in the area, I am so willing to drive the 35/40 minutes one way  from home just to get my fix.  Yes, with places like Dick's Hideaway/Richardson's relatively just up the street from me, I would drive to the Burrito Shack just for their red chile (burrito, enchiladas, or burrito enchilada style).\n\nI have not tried their green chile but if it is as good and authentic as the red, oh watch out.  \n\nThey are known for their burritos for good reason too.  They are quite large and the ingredients quality.  \n\nThe price is sooo right here.  Very reasonable for the very generous portions.  \n\nThis place is nothing fancy.  It has \"patio\"/outdoor dining but nothing indoor.  It is almost literally a shack.  During the summer I recommend calling your order in ahead and picking it up to avoid the wait in the heat as their Order/Pick-Up window is not an enclosed air conditioned situation.","Amazing food. Everything hand made and fresh. I eat here multiple times a week and have yet to have it disappoint.","Stopped in to this place and it was hopping.  Seems like a lot of ASU Poly students frequent this place, and after eating here, I see why!  Got a beef burrito, and it was good sized, and the beef was spiced right. Great hot sauce made every bite delicious. Prices were lower than I expected, I will definitely be stopping by regularly from now on. I don't mind the shack part, but be aware it literally is a shack!","Great customer service and a cheap price ($7 for a carne asada burrito w/small drink) but the food was overall decent at best and not nearly as authentic as I hoped it would be. If you are looking for some authentic Mexican food, go somewhere else.","Don't judge a book by its cover. Their rustic exterior contains excellent service and great burritos (I had the green chile & pork breakfast burrito). Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Don't miss this place when you're in the east valley.","Whoa nelly! This place is amazing! Great service with a smile at the walk up window, the food is made in small batches with love! The Connis burrito is great, the chunky salsa I will dream about! Don't let the exterior keep you away, this place rocks!!!!","This place was amazing!  Like everyone one else, we would drive by and it looks scary on the outside.  We read a few Yelp reviews just to see what it was a bout and decided to try it.  I am so glad we did!  \nYou are greeted by the nicest person taking your order.  They are very helpful for first timers.  You can see everyone in the back making things from scratch in small batches.  We got a Connis Burrito, chips and salsa, a ground beef taco (My new favorite!) and a chicken taco.  The food was amazing and we had to order more salsa as we ate it all.  \nThe service was great and they remembered our name.  They ran out of some things and someone came out and apologized to everyone and told them their food would be out shortly.  No one seemed to care as everything was being made fresh.  \nIt's really clean on the inside and the food is made with love!","This is my new favorite fast food Mexican restaurant. Tried carne asada, quesadilla, and machaca all great. Hot salsa is great with a little kick. Mild is ok, but a little watery for my taste. This is a must try!","I love this place. I have been taking my friends and they love it too. I have only ever ordered breakfast but it is amazing!!! The staff is also great! Im starting to get to know the entire family. Nicest people ever.","This place has off hours, but if you happen to be driving by while it's open you should defiantly stop in.  All of their burritos are awesome!  Dining in is a bit like dining in a shack so I guess it stands up to its name.","Wherever highschool and college kids hang out ot get lunch, I'm always going to check it out. They (the hs kids) are usually frugal (cheap) and want lots of quantity and decent-good quality. I had literally driven past this place a few times right when I moved into the neighborhood and missed it. I checked it on Yelp, but I was a little put-off by the overall appearance. Don't let it fool you.\n\nVisually the place is right out of something you'd see in TJ, They say they put the money back into the food and not the building. You'll find old plastic lawn chairs and homemade wooden tables to sit at, It adds to the legitimacy of the business - you come here for the food and VERY casual setting. There has been a lot of construction on Power road, which has made access sometimes tough if you're in a lowered car. The parking lot is gravel/dirt. \n\nThe owners and workers inside are so nice. I once bought a candy bar from her son who was selling them for a fundraiser. They are polite and never ever rude.\n\nIt can take a little bit of time to get your order, especially if they are busy. If you're in a jam for time- call it in ahead so it's ready for you. \n\nI have had California burrito, taquitos (rolled tacos), quesadilla, bean rice cheese potato (BRCP) burrito, fries and chips. I haven't had any breakfast burritos... yet.\n\nIf you're hungry, I would suggest the \"Shack\" size on the burrito size, as its well, duh, bigger. It's not Chipotle with-every-ingredient-possible-sized-burrito big, but its moderately big.","Not bad, not great. Got a bacon breakfast burrito, added ham. Good burrito, but it wasn't that hot. Given, we drove over somewhere else to eat them, so they may have lost their temp on the way over, but if they were hot to begin with, the cheese would have melted, which it didn't. No big deal, still not a bad burrito. Nothing to write home about, though. I definitely want to try it again, eat it right away and give it another chance.\n\nNot really blown away like other reviewers were.","A real hole in the wall joint in a gravel lot - What this place lacks in aesthetics it makes up in price and quality. \n\nThe price is pretty comparable to Chipotle and Filibertos and they have a pretty decent amount of choices on their menu. Stick to anything with Carne Asada!\n\nThe hours are a bit weird too 6:30am-2pm","Operative words for this place are cheap and tasty. Get anything with carne asada. It is actually in a shack, so don't expect too much ambiance other than large wooden tables full of construction workers and college students from down the road. I would suggest calling your order in ahead as the line at lunch can get long.","Read all the rave reviews about this place. Finally stopped by to give it a shot. Friendly staff however extremely disappointing food. Ordered the carne asada fries and beef taco. Flavorless...seriously..","Had the California burrito here. It was a burrito with French fries inside that was unique. Nothing outstanding but nice to mix it up if your tired of the average burrito.","Although this place looks like something from a shanty town, don't let that scare you because the place is sanitary and serves great mexican food. It's decently priced and I haven't had anything I don't like. Everything is home-made as far as I can see and tastes delicious. Just make sure you remember the hours since they're a little odd. I love their green chile pork and potato burrito. Large servings fill you up so you could even split a burro if you don't eat a lot. I would put aside any prejudice from the look and give this place a try.","I love this place. The food is awesome! I usually get the Country breakfast burrito. It has gravy & is pretty amazing! \n\nThe place is nothing to look at. I never actually stay and eat. I just order and go. To make it faster just call ahead to order. \n\nThe burritos come in smaller or shack size. I always get smaller and can never finish the whole thing. They are quite a good size for being smaller. The prices are really good, too. I usually get the hot & mild sauce with my burrito because I can't get enough. The hot doesn't have heat (it takes A LOT for me) but it's pretty good. \n\nIf you want something delicious for cheap & you're ok if the place isn't fancy then I recommend the shack.","You want to talk about a little secret in Gilbert? This is it. I drove right past this place for years when I went to ASU East and I've lived right around the corner for 3 years now. It's a dump on the outside... Literally a shack, but a friend recommended it, so I tried it for breakfast. Seriously, one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. Customer service is great, too. I just wish this place was advertised a little better, because I would have came here sooner!"],"business_id":"1V1lodaiyYw4ZKyiv95pyw","name":"Burrito Shack","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["We love this place! It's pretty good fast food (and healthy-ish) type Mexican food. The menu is not extensive, but the servings are plentiful. Sort of like Chipotle, but ten times better. And I believe kids eat for free on the weekends.\n\nThey also serve breakfast in the mornings (u'mmm chorizo!).","I have been frequenting this place lately for lunch and it is even better than before. I love the amount of food you can get. I went from the Chicken Burrito on Wheat Tortilla to a Salad with Chicken. I go for the corn, black beans, fajitas, brown rice, chicken, pico, cheese, guacamole, green salsa, and cabbage. Top it off with a water cup. \n\nHealthy and delicious. And very quick service. There is another place I will not name on the opposite side of the building that takes a very long time to order and get your food. This place is a great alternative!","Best burritos in Vegas......hands down!!! Red sauce is perfect!","Zabas. Zabas, Zabas. So far I am stuck with their bowls, burritos (shredded beef) and quesadillas, but I am anxiously awaiting their tacos and rolled tacos. Food is always well prepared and fresh, the staff is very friendly, and the store is always spotless ( That stainless steel Back of House is BEAUTIFUL) \n\nA word of caution: Red Sauce is reserved for satan himself, and while the green looks like a nice and comforting alternative, it will still make your ice water. \n\nO and the queso is to die for. ( Pretty sure there is cream cheese in it, how could it not be?)\n\nThanks Zabas!","This is a great spot to hit up after the gym. It's located near LVAC on the South West Side at I-215 & Flamingo. It has ample seating and there are a few tables outside the front door if you want to eat outside.\n\nYou line up to order your food and they make your food to order as you move down the line. You pick the ingredients you want in your burrito, taco, etc....and you pay at the end of the line. I like it here because they have grilled chicken, veggies, brown rice, and other healthy ingredients. You can also get bowls if you don't want the wraps. The portions are more than enough. I can't even finish a burrito there. The tacos are also very good. You get a choice of soft or hard shells.\n\nStop in if you want a healthy meal after the gym.","I really like Zaba's - I had the buritto bowl last night.  The line moves fast.  You get nice size portions.  Everything is fresh.  It's very clean and the service is always nice.  I enjoy their buritto bowl over Chipotle.","Ok so while I was living near here at 215 and flamingo I used to get zabas probably three times a week, was it healthy? No. Was it delicious? You bet! I still am tempted to go on my way out of the gym sometimes, and I still often stop in and get a burrito. Heres a tip from an experienced patron, get chipotle ranch instead of sour cream. Sour cream has no flavor, trust me you will be glad you opted for the chipotle ranch. Also the sweet potatoes are excellent! I highly recommend trying this place.","In a long search for inexpensive tacos we finally found Zaba's.  Excellent fast food.  It's like a 5 Guys or Subway for Tacos.  You can build your own like a Subway order.  Try it for a quick taco fix.","If you like Chipotle's, you will like this place, as they are identical. This is a \"fresh and healthy\" type restaurant. I went for lunch with my wife. Basically, you pick the item you want, I had steak tacos, and then you add the toppings you want, all for one price. \n   After spooning my \"marinated, then grilled\" steak into the tortillas from the hot line, I was rushed over to the cold line for additional toppings, bypassing beans, rice, etc. I had the lady go back to  the hot line to get the toppings I wanted then back to the cold line. I felt that I was being rushed through the line even though no one was behind me! I managed to find the only salt shaker in the place, and had to use Cholula hot sauce to have any flavor on the food. Very bland food, can't call this a Mexican restaurant in any way. Bland food, rushed through the line, not a good exp.\n   The only good things are guac was good, restrooms were clean, quantity of food was decent for the price.","Omg they give out toppings like they are going out of business and trying to make their last bits of food last.  I feel like I'm being rationed.  What the heck, how much can beans and rice really cost!?","In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.\n\nThis location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   \n\nI did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   \n\nA good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.","If I'm hungover, or just hungry and looking for something quick, this is the spot I will go 95% of the time.  Not the best mexican food out there, but the portions are big, flavors bold, and service accommodating.","I eat at Zaba's about once a month after working out at LVAC.  It's in the same parking lot as the gym, but I also appreciate the healthier options that they provide...such as:\nWheat tortillas \nBrown rice\nSWEET POTATOES\nGrilled chicken/shrimp/fajita veggies \n\nThey are not my favorite Mexican grill flavor wise, but the food is all good, the service is fast & friendly, and I love the extra options.","Zaba's is part of that \"fast casual\" concept that Chipotle etc are part of. I go back and forth between Chipotle and Zaba's to trying to figure out which one I like more. At Zaba's I like their salsas and the fact that I can get wheat tortilla's when I am in the mood for a burrito or brown rice when I am having the burrito bowl. My sons are big fans because on the weekends they have some type of \"kids eat free promotion\" which makes it a convenient stop after their basketball games!","The reasons I choose this place over Chipotle: Wheat Tortilla, Brown Rice option, pesto cilantro sauce, no charge for guacamole on items. I go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal. I usually get the salad with brown rice, black beans, chicken, pesto sauce and salsa. I also like the option for a wheat tortilla. Guacamole is fresh and has always been good. Great food, great healthy options, good service.","This place beats qdoba and chipotle on taste and if that wasn't reason enough to come here I also come because I can get brown rice and wheat tortilla which is not an option at their competitor's spots.","its close to lvac so if you need a little post workout recovery burrito, i suggest going here. i get brown rice, sweet potato, half chicken half steak, corn, tomato, green sauce, sour creme, and cheese. if anything, get the sweet potato. the flavor combo is perfect with the burrito.","I love this whole genre of eateries. \nEach one has it's pro/con's, and while I like Zaba's it is my least frequented of them all.\n\nI generally get the 3 steak taco's with just cheese and sour cream, as I am a very plain eater.  Zabas steak is nice and spicy, with lots of flavor.\nAs a HUGE fan of Qdoba's Chips and Queso I had high hopes for Zaba's - but I found their queso to resemble melted plastic with peppers in it. There was nothing\nappealing about it at all to me.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it, but I did not.  The chips also lacked flavor and were just average.\nI can't remember what burrito my boyfriend got, but he really enjoyed it.  I'd go back, but not spend the money on the Queso.\n\nThe service was great and the people were very nice, even though we came close to closing\n\nLet me tell you, my boyfriend was pretty excited about his Modelo with his dinner!","Another great opportunity to check out a place I've been meaning to try, thanks to Groupon. \n\nThe queso sauce was super yum yum. I got the nachos with the shredded beef. I found everything to be pretty good, but the queso sauce outshone everything else on my plate. My fella got the steak burrito with brown rice and pinto beans. \n\nI love that they have the option of whole wheat tortilla and brown rice. That's the great thing about this place. Healthy and non-healthy options unite. \n\nI'll definitely be back! More queso please.","A little more expensive compared to chipotle/qdoba. The shrimp was very delicious and the overall meal seemed healthier than similar restaurants.","Probably the worst burrito and bowl i have eaten in my life. I have no idea how a place this terrible get such high reviews. Ive been here twice and each time regretted why on earth i chose to. Taco bell or any fast food chain is better than what this place has to offer. Upon my first visit i tried there burrito. The tortilla they had gave me was ice cold as if it had just came out the refrigerator. It had a dry and chewy consistency, and the chicken was as bland as cardboard, i had to drown my meal in hot sauce just to eat it. The beans were extremely liquidly and after taking the first bite all fell out of the burrito ( not to mention it was poorly wrapped). The next time i came here i got a bowl, i figured theres no tortilla, they cant really mess that up but boy was i wrong, same problem with the chicken and it was still cold, i didn't even finish i had a few bites and threw it away. All i can say is that I'm never eating here again.","Well let's start by saying that their cilantro pesto deserves a star all by itself. That stuff turns anything you put it on into amazing!\n\nAlthough, I unfortunately had to subtract 2 stars because I felt so rushed by the workers!! I barely had time to think what I really wanted on my burrito. There wasn't anyone behind me in line and only two people in the place. You would think they could be a little more patient with me, especially since it was my first time there and I wanted to customize my meals perfectly. I even asked a couple times about the workers opinions of what she liked best and she laughed and said she didn't know...\n\nIt would be nice to have some more feedback from the employees here as well as not feel rushed and like I'm taking up to much of their time for my one order.\n\nOn the upside, it's close to the LVAC gym and you can definitely make healthy options here. I like their wide variety of sides and sauces. They even have sweet potatoes! I will be back and hope to see improvements in the future. :)","Not bad, Zaba's!  I pass this place almost every day, as it is close to my gym, but I've never stopped to eat here. Today I decided to bite the bullet (or the burrito, as it were), and give it a shot.  \n\nThis place is kind of like the Subway of Mexican food. You pick your type of food (burrito/bowl), the type of wrapping (flour or corn tortilla), the meat you want, and they'll slide you on down the line as you pick your fixings.  I decided on a chicken burrito with a flour tortilla. I particularly appreciated that beans were not mandatory on my burrito and that sour cream was not extra.\n\nAll in all, it was pretty good. I felt like they were a little skimpy on the chicken, but all of the fixings were tasty and it was a sizable enough burrito. One thing that needed improvement was that it wasn't very hot. I am one of those people who likes my food piping hot, and this was just warm at best. The corn salsa also has lots of cilantro, just an FYI.\n\nService was very quick and friendly, and the cost for the burrito was $7.59 (including tax).","Not bad :) Not bad :) I'm obsessed with Mexican grills.  Portion size was good.  Meat was good.  Guac was Fabu!  But I would still have to go to cafe rio and rank that my top pick, but I would definitely come back here.  The service was great!!  The dude at the counter was incredibly chipper.  I was happy to see how HIGH the ameba sneeze glass was which made it a little hard to hear them as they took my order, but I'll take that any day over having peeps highjacking my grub with their infected germs :) :)  Anyhoo, all in all, the black iced tea was delish, and I would like to request a larger offering of faux sweetener - splenda please :)","Great prices. Nice portion. Healthy ingredients. Salad is what I get. Love that it comes with guacamole! Perfect when I crave Mexican but want it healthy!","I def had high hopes for this place from the hype they showed at Bite of Las Vegas & the reviews I read on here. I was pretty excited to see they had a burrito w/ chicken, steak, & shrimp, but they said they were out of steak. How do you run out of steak when it's a staple on your menu?!? When I did find something to order I realized that the setup is much like Chipotle. They did have an extra item which was the potato squares. I ended up getting a chicken burrito w/ the potatoes, cheese, brown rice, salsa, & lettuce. The burrito was a very good size, maybe slightly bigger than what you would find at Chipotle. Bit in & expected awesomeness, totally not the case. It didn't have the same taste as Chipotle, then again it didn't taste fresh. Not sure if it was the chicken or what, but if I do decide to try them again I would wanna try something else as it wasn't very tasty.\nThe establishment was clean & the staff was helpful & friendly.","I'm a huge fan of Zaba's and a firm believer that it is far superior to Chipotle, Cafe Rio or any other similar restaurant for several reasons: \n\n- There's WAY more options - white AND brown rice, yellow AND sweet potatoes, shrimp AND fish tacos, steak AND shredded beef, quesadillas AND nachos, wheat AND flour tortillas.\n- The owners are friendly locals. This isn't part of a national franchise, so support your community! \n- Lastly: the cilantro-walnut pesto. It's refreshing, rich and one of the best things I've added to a taco.","I tried most everything on the menu here. I really love this place, it's way better than chipotle. They have options like wheat tortillas and brown rice, plus fish and shrimp tacos which are great. The steak is actually pretty good unlike the little chewy pieces of rubber u get at similar chains. The guac and brownies are excellent. Only complaints are I don't care for the flavor of the carnitas and they are a bit more pricy than their counterparts.","Chipotle, Qdoba, Zaba's........\n\nLike many other Americanized burrito joints, Zaba's offers a lot of the same.  You choose your protein, beans, rice, salsa, fillings, they roll, you eat.  I may be the only person to hate Chipotle, so if you're a fan you may like Zaba's as well.\n\nMy experience there wasn't all bad.  The place is clean, the staff friendly and happy to let you try one of the meats before choosing it in your burrito.  I don't think this is any better or worse than Chipotle or Qdoba, it's just that all these places are average at best.  \n\nI went with the shredded beef tacos.  The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful, but the hot salsa and pico de gallo helped. \n\nI had the chicken nachos as well.  The queso sauce they use is salty and while many people will like it, I did not.  I wouldn't come back here, but again, I'm not a fan of this type of place, so take my review with a grain of salt, or in the case of the queso, lots of salt.","I work near this restaurant and have eaten here many times.  The food is consistent and the service is speedy and friendly.  I like that they have both white and brown rice to chose from.\nThe guacamole is better at this establishment than any other places that are similar.","Luv the bowls and the queso dip !","I love this place! I think their barbacoa burritos are better than Chipotles. Staff is friendly and the place is clean.","After an intense workout, I always get hungry. Zaba's is the perfect place to go after such workout. \n\nZaba's is located in the same lot as LVAC. It has the same concept as Chipotle and Cafe Rio but with much healthier options. They had brown rice before Chipotle started to offer it. They have whole wheat tortillas. They have fish and shrimp. They win. \n\nI always order a salad with chicken. The awesome thing about Zaba's salads are that all of them come with guacamole, free of charge. I keep out the cheese and sour cream (sad face) to avoid totally ruining my workout. They also have toppings that Chipotle or Cafe Rio do not: sweet potatoes, cabbage, different salad dressings. \n\nThe employees there are great. I walked in one time at 8:50 PM when they were about to close at 9 PM. I usually don't do this, but I was really hungry and wanted some Zabas. The employees were really nice about it. I still felt bad though...\n\nPortions aren't too small and they're not too big. I think they're just right. They have a good thing going on in prime location with yummy, fresh food!","Chipotle. I'm sure it aggravates the owner to be compared to them, but that's what they are.  Not sure who came up with the concept first, but obviously Chipotle is bigger. The food overall was OK. Nothing to write home about and I think the prices are comparable.   The tortilla was a little gummy, but everything seemed to be fresh. The guac was decent.","Zaba's - Saturdays, kids eat free!\n\nVegetarian Burrito with a wheat tortilla!\n\nThe place is clean with plenty of places to sit.  The employees are nice.  The food isn't bad for the price.  KIDS EAT FREE!  \n\nTake the family out for lunch on Saturday and save a few dollars.","Just got home from eating lunch at Zaba's. No problems or complaints from this place! I ordered the shredded beef burrito [$6.89] that came with your choice of white/wheat flour tortilla, white/brown rice, black/pinto beans, salsa pico de gallo/seasoned corn/green tomatillo, shredded cheese & lettuce. My main man ordered the carnitas burrito [$6.49], same choices. The total came to $17 with a small soda & brownie :) \n\nThe burritos seem bigger than the other burrito places, but tiny me never really finishes a fat burrito in one sitting :P Zaba's seems to have larger portions & more variety on their menu. OH & that brownie we ate was bomb. I don't wana say it's as thick as the rice crispy treats they have at starbucks, but it's maybe half that size? Still a big size if you ask me [yea, that's what SHE said].. Anyway ...\n\nIt doesn't seem as busy as the other signature gourmet Mexican grills, but I like Zaba's since they have healthier choices as far as the wheat & brown rice. They serve coke products & they have the tabasco sauces [jalapeno, smoked], also cholula! yum yumm.. Since it's in the same shopping area that LVAC is in, they probably have discounts for LVAC members. They also have their liquor license so they have domestic & Mexican beers. I know one of these days I'll show up there sweaty from the gym & drink some beer to gain those calories back. oOoh yes! haha","Finally made a trip here last night and enjoyed my chicken and pork burrito with queso sauce, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, brown rice and black beans on a WHEAT tortilla. I was waiting to see when one of these Mexican grill joints were going to start using some other types of tortillas... there are some great flavors out there. Seeing how Zabas is the only one I have been to that offers an option besides a white tortilla. They also had brown rice as an option besides white rice which was actually a nice change. The queso sauce here is not as good as Qdoba and they charge you extra for it here (which I don't believe Qdoba does) so that is a big reason for the -1 star. They charged me $1.25 for what rang up as a SM. QUESO for the half a scoop of queso sauce I asked for on my burrito.\n\nOverall the burrito was good... very flavorful. A burrito with queso sauce and a regular drink ran me $10. Bit pricey but at least it was good. The decor is nice and it was very clean. The location is not that great for them and I'm sure it hurts business but once you get to it its worth a try. I will be going back and giving a second opinion.","Zaba's Mexican Grill is a small chain of  convenient Americanized Mexican fast food eateries, all located in the Las Vegas area. There are about 5 -6 of them now.\n\nZaba's is like Chipotle, but browner. \n\nNo, not browner as in darker Mexicans, ones with more indian blood than Spanish blood. Not at all. Browner because instead of white floured tortillas or white rice, they offer healthier brown. \n\nZaba's concept is very similar to Chipotle, even the line and service process at the counter is similar. But Zaba's offers more variety. Such as brown rice, wheat tortillas, or fish and shrimp tacos or burritos. \n\nThey also have a more colorful decor than the tin can aluminum decor of Chipotle. This one is also larger than most Chipotles, with booths and tables and about 2 to3 times the seating capacity.\n\nI came here to order lunch for a group I was visiting in a nearby office, a lunch and learn session. They had faxed the order in, but the manager was so anal, he couldn't fill the order unless they used their official fax order form! WTF? He faxed back the official form and said he called. Meanwhile, I had talked to him several times about the order, and he didn't tell me this. So I had to call the office, confirm the order, and told him to fill in the blanks that weren't on the order. He had difficulty with this, being a bit OCD or something.\n\nWe finally got the order put together and delivered the food. It is pretty tasty, even when it is browner.","Been a Zabas fan ever since the first one opened here. Always loved Chipotle but since I've discovered Zabas, I haven't eaten there in years! Just imagine Chipotle's bigger brother....on steroids...or should I say a health kick?\n\nThey have everything they have and more. A choice between white and brown rice, a choice between white or wheat tortillas and a whole lot more! And they have Coke Zero! Whoot Whoot Holla!!!\n\nStaff is quick and know what they are doing! This location even offers free WiFi! I recommend everyone to try this place and jump off the Chipotle bandwagon!","I've eaten here about 10 times already so I think it's safe to say that I love Zaba's. I've ordered both Bowls and Burritos. My usual order is Cilantro Lime Rice, Sweet Potato, either Carnitas or Beef, Medium Salsa, Sour Cream & Cheese. I also order a Side of Chips, which has a hint of salt & lime, for 99cents! Can't go wrong with that.\n\nIf you come as often as I do, it could come off a little pricey but I love the food and it's worth trying once, especially if you enjoy Mexican food. I think of it as a healthier version of Chipotle.","I am not gonna lie this place is way awesome. I was totally surprised when m wife and I discovered it. We love chipotle and Cafe Rio but this place's salads beat any of those! Plus they dont charge extra for every little thing, not even guacamole! The people are just a fast and very nive and it is never packed. Go for sure! We had a great experience. Best thing about the salads, get the pesto lime sauce and sweet potato chips on it, to die for!","Very good and quick food.  Guacamole is fresh and you get\na choice of whole wheat or regular tortilla.  Nice service and very clean kitchen","Right next door to Cupcake Lane Bakery is this wanna-be mexican fast food joint.\n\nAll I can say positive is it was fast.\n\nVery limited menu-nothing resembles real mexican and it's really just a Baja Fresh or Chipotle knock-off.","A faithful interpretation of the San Francisco burrito style, but nothing overly amazing goes on here. Plus for having whole wheat tortillas, brown rice and Veggie options.","Whenever I'm craving a quesadilla I come straight here. There's just something about them that makes it so delicious. Maybe it's the cheese? I also always order a bag of chips to dip in my guacamole/salsa. There's many burrito options here, you can make almost anything you want. One of my favorite little Mexican spots.","its a little better than chipotle, same price range, the only thing i enjoyed were the fish tacos, which are not offered at chipotle. the fish tacos were good and freshly made, thats enough for me to choose Zaba's over Chipotle."],"business_id":"1_UbvYpj7N-jE2VYICPl2Q","name":"Zaba's Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I am going to have to echo Alexander C's review about the variability in the quality here.  I have always thought of Rio Mirage as the best of the best for authentic Mexican food, but honestly my last time was not so great.  I am going to try again though since I realize any restaurant can have an off day.  Hoping for better next time.\n\nMy last visit I got it take-out.  Food was overly greasy, so much so I could not tolerate it.  Beans were good, but rice was not so tasty.\n\nThere is another Rio Mirage off of Bell Rd that is newer and is good, so may end up having to \"switch\" to that one.","We stopped by the day before Cinco de Mayo to get our fix and we were pleasantly surprised at what this place had to offer. The pitcher of margaritas hit the spot. My daughter loved her kids meal. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that we had to wait forever for the check.","Only came in to pick up some of their homemade tortillas. One word, meal. I could eat an entire dozen just for dinner. Add a margarita and I'm done. Gotta try those tortillas!","I'm reluctant to post this review because I'd hate to see this place get too popular.  It's perfect the way it is.  We ate here again last night - that makes three or four times for me and several more for others in my family.  It is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.  I always order the fish tacos (delicious but messy) - other popular entrees in my family include the carne asada and el bombero (also beef).  The margaritas are also wonderful (and enormous).  Highly recommend this place, but sure hope it stays the way it is.","2 stars for the food, +1 star for the ambiance & service :) \n\nHaving said that, they put cheese on EVERYTHING.... luckily they didn't douse the drinks, lol! \nI don't know, when it comes to real Mexican food, I'm a purist :)\nIf you're going to put cheese on something then let it be an authentic Mexican cheese! I don't like my food smothered in Jack, American or any other Velveta like substance :(  Now, I'm sure that if you ask for no cheese they will oblige! Learn from my mistakes :) \n\nThe machaca I salvaged from beneath the layer of cheese was good.\n \nI did not want the rice & beans (don't judge me) so the waiter asked if I wanted a salad instead. I said YES, & could it have avocados? Oh yeah! \nI did get my salad. Iceberg lettuce, little tomato & about 3 slices of avocado. I ate the avocado & when my bill came realized that although I did not get rice & beans my meal was priced the same AND I was charged extra for the avocado. I paid it, but I don't think I'll do that again. \n\nI did not have any alcoholic beverages, just coffee, & that was not great either.","The food is great, shrimp cocktails have an authentic flavor. The shredded beef tacos are my favorite. Fresh tortillas are a must! Would have given more stars but the wait staff is inconsistent, the food is with it though.","We love coming to Rio Mirage when we are on the west side.  We have come in several times with a group of 8+ and everytime we are accomodated quickly and with execellent service!\n\nThe food is always amazing and had never disappointed.  Two people at our table tried the Bonitarita and the Margarita..wow...the Bonitarita knocked it out of the park.  It is a great margarita...it is a little more expensive but worth every penny!!\n\nWe also ordered fajitas (two of us split the order), I was so impressed with the number of shrimp and veggies in the order, but a little disappointed they only gave 2 tortillas.","I love this place! The food is great and feels like your eating authentic Mexican food not like Chipotle! I prefer the El Mirage location over the Surprise location because of its authenticy and the fact that its the original! If you go try the El Rico burrito in beef or chicken, or half and half you won't be disappointed! Only drawback is it that during our cooler Arizona months its packed with snowbirds!","This place is a good lunch break spot if you are on your lunch break and have an entire hour to spare. The service seems to always be great, but it can get pretty crowded during lunch. \nIf you are in Surprise and have a more authentic Mexican food craving and alternative to Chipotle and Caramba's where you can sit down, kick back and have a few margaritas, then this place is your choice. \n\nThe tacos and lunch enchilada specials can never be beat during lunch. When you order the fish tacos or enchiladas del mar (with shrimp), the soft taco shells are soft and oily versus just regular soft flaky corn tortillas or crunchy type tortillas. I just end up eating the inside of the taco, so it's a bit rich for my taste to eat the oiliness. Don't get me wrong, I know that when I'm eating Mexican, it's not necessarily going to be healthy, but it gets overwhleming when you have 2 layer soggy taco shells to eat per taco so it doesn't fall apart on you. \n\nChimichangas are pretty good here. Again, not really the typically true Mexican fare, but they satiate the craving for crunchy friedness filled with shredded beef or chicken goodness. Overall, this place is \"A-OK\" in my book, but nothing overally spectacular.","My fiance and I so happened to stumble upon this place amongst Grand Avenue and residential homes. The parking lot was so full and the streets were crowded, but we are young so we decided to do the Arizona thing and romp in the dirt to park.\n\nWe arrived with friendly faces, the bartender was a lovely lady with a great sense of humor and good taste for margaritas! Our server was excellent and was a great conversationalist without being up in our faces. The restaurant was crowded with blue haired couples on the night out in the town with margaritas and smiles on their faces. \n\nWe ordered too much food, but glad we did so we could have left overs. The margaritas were yummy and they hit the spot. You have a choice of small, medium, and large...I say go with the large! \n\nWe ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was good, but I probably won't order it again. Then we had the posole (pozole) which was to die for! They make it with beef...which I am not use to but...wow..what a great soup. I am a menudo fan so for those of you who cannot stomach menudo (pun intended) then try their posole. Plus, the soup comes with tortillas that are homemade and they are the best tortillas that I have had in Arizona!! My great-aunt might have to do a tortilla off with this place! \n\nThen we topped our meal with enchiladas del mar with imitation crab meat. It was tasteful, but I think I will come again and try something else. In the end we loved the service, the mariachi band, and the food and drinks are not stained with chain restaurant after taste but seemed to be made from the heart.","Rio Mirage in El Mirage has gotten kind of blah. The food used to be spicer, more flavorful, just had some pop to it. The service has been meh as well the last few visits. This most recent visit, he never came to check on us nor did we get a single refill. I hope that they will take this to heart as a long time El Mirage resident who has been a regular customer that they should NOT tone down the flavor of the food to satisfy the old-sters who only come for a few months out of the year. If you are wondering why your place isn't as packed when those folks go home--now you know why!","Half-priced margaritas on Saturdays? WOO HOO! \n\nWe've taken our family here for dinner, maybe 10-12 times over the past 9 years. That doesn't really represent how much we like the food; we're just usually shuttling around other parts of town. \n\nSo here's what to like: \n1. Consistently good Mexican food. From their standard combos to the chef's selections, everything we've tried on the menu has been really good. Yum! \n2. Chips & salsa until the cows come home. And it's really fresh salsa with super-tasty, hot chips in a bottomless bowl. Yum! \n3. Fresh tortillas, hot off the press. You can even buy a dozen for about $4... it seems pricey until you taste 'em. Yum! \n4. My little chitlins actually eat the rice and beans here. Nowhere else. Weird, eh? \n5. Did I mention half-priced margaritas... on SATURDAY?? We got their jumbo-sized house margaritas for $4. Even better, the bartender did not have a light hand. The worst part was deciding who got to drink, and who had to stay sober to drive... lol \n6. VERY reasonably priced. Dinner for five, with alcohol, was under $70, including tip... AND we had leftovers. \n7. Their whole menu is available to-go. Score! \n8. Friendly, efficient staff. I've never had to wonder where our meals, drinks or bill were, and everyone is smiling and courteous. BIG plus in my book. \n9. Mariachi music... ole! \n\nNot so great: \n1. Yeah. It's right by Sun City, which means a lot of golden oldies. More power to them, though, as they appear to lap up those margaritas like water. Just wish they weren't driving after... :/\n2. The parking lot ain't great. This place can fill up, making parking only possible across the road... next to the railroad tracks. Meh. \n\nSo based on my scientific analysis above, this place is a good value for a great, casual Mexican dining experience. Great spot to hit, on the way to/from the lake or Vegas, or if you're a local!","Home made tortillas !","You know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome.. then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first.. thats Rio Mirage in El Mirage, AZ.\n\nThe first time we stopped in this place was awesome! They had the yummiest rice and beans.. as well as very good chimi's enchiladas etc.. but since the first time we've been there it just hasn't been as good.. the rice dry and greasy.. the beans, run of the mill.. food being burnt and greasy, greasy, greasy.. spotty service and in my opinion sub par ingredients make this place now an avoid.. what a shame too since they had so much going for them. Very disappointing.","While I don't think there is a river or a mirage anywhere near this place, there does always seem to a large puddle of water in the parking lot. At least I think there is, unless, it's a mirage. Hmmm...What isn't a mirage is a restaurant full of local Latino families and a sea of blue haired, varicose veined, AARP folks from Sun City. I should know. Cuz my Sun City living mom and dad love Rio Mirage. This is where me and mom let loose and bond over a couple margs. While dad sips his ice tea and flirts with the waitress. I've had good luck ordering the same thing here. Carne Asada with beans and tortillas. I kinda put the steak in the tortilla, roll it up with some fixins. Chew. Smile. Chug more margarita. Mom loves the grilled quesadilla and dad's finicky ordering style is accommodated with \"ground beef tacos. Hard. Nothing fancy.\" We always get great service and I love the local vibe. And the margarita buzz gets me through an entire game of bridge with Big Daddy and Momma Jo!","A local favorite around here. This was one of the first places we ate at when we moved into the neighborhood. The food is tasty with a very large selection of items. Their pricing seems to be in par with mainstream mexican food restaurants even though you would expect it to be cheaper as it appears to be more of a \"mom and pop\" kind of place. \n\nThey have a small cantina where you can come and sit down in and enjoy a very cheap but very tasty margarita. They even have $.99 margs on mondays. \n\nWe've come back multiple times and each time have had a pleasant experience each time. The best part, it's practically walking distance.","My family & I have been coming here for almost 5 years. We've never had a bad experience. Discount Margarita nights are the best & my kids love the Mariachi band on the weekends. They opened a new one in Surprise, but it's not the same. The original is the best . If your on the fence to try it or not, give it a chance you won't be disappointed!!","My husband and I have been coming here for about 7 years.  The food is always great, and we love their .99 margaritas on Mondays.  The staff is also very friendly.  The atmosphere is great, and we always bring our out-of-town guests here, for some good authentic Mexican food you can't find other places!  They've opened a second location in Surprise, but I'm in agreement with many other Yelpers in saying that this original location is much better!","Always delicious food and great service.The atmosphere is so cozy and homey.Some times the owner comes by and asks us how everything is.Nice personal touch.","We ordered the buffet, the food was not very good and almost cold. The waiter we had did not say a word to us after taking our drink order, overall I'd say to avoid the buffet it, it was a waste of money.","First time at the original location. \nLove the restaurant. Classic Mexican food. I ordered a shrimp burrito and it was outstanding! Their rice and beans are exceptionally good as well! \nI also ordered a sangria. Different than what I was expecting-they add orange juice to the wine-but good and refreshing nonetheless! \nWill definitely be back!","One of those places that  you go one time and the food is great, you go the next time and it was so-so.","A mixed crowd from Surprise & Sun City. Crowded but quick, efficient service.  Everybody loved their food... Guacamole was fresh and very good. The chicken & spinach enchiladas were yummy!!!! \n\nI would definitely come back if in the area and might even drive from the other side of town for the incredibly delicious specialty Watermelon margarita drink (can't remember what it was called).\n\nI think the guac and the enchiladas were described as \"spicy\" - I did ask the server about it as I'm a whimp and neither were spicy... So not sure if he adjusted or if you should order extra spicy if that's how you prefer it. Parking lot is tiny and you have to back out if it's full... Unless you can see that there is a spot, I'd just park along the street/railroad tracks.  \n\nCharming patio... Wish this was in my neighborhood...","While looking for an old favorite Mexican restaurant we couldn't find, we stumbled upon Rio Mirage.  It was very busy, which is always a good sign.  We were not disappointed.  The food was very good but a tad bit pricey.  There weren't enough a la carte items.  However, the four of us all enjoyed our food.  We also went to the Rio Mirage in Sun City West, but for some reason the one in El Mirage seemed to be better and tastier.","I believe this might be the best Mexican food I have had in Phoenix.  \n\nTo start, be ready for a possible walk....because their parking lot sucks!  haha  It's just too small.  I often have to park in the dirt lot across the street by the train tracks.  However....once you are inside, it is wonderful!  The place is well-kept and clean.  Atmosphere is great.  All of the staff are friendly, and the Managers are usually running around helping out and just chatting with the customers.  \n\nThe food is Awesome!  I have been several times now with friends and family, and have tried many of their dishes.  My personal favorite is their specialty burrito - the El Rico!  Great mix of ingredients and spices.  \n\nIf you get a chance, stop in.  You won't regret it!","We love the food . Going there for years the food just gets better.","Loved everything. The salsa , the beans, the service, the ambiance, the food, the portions. I tend to be a bit picky about Mexican food.  The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 8 pm and it's an odd location. I finally found a restaurant I'll go back to time and again.","This is the good location. Awesome food. Friendly & warm atmosphere. They have a mariachi band!!! made me smile. :-):-):-)","This is the best mexican food I have ever eaten! Everything was fresh and so tasty! The service was great too! I just moved to Arizona a couple of months ago and this restaurant is by far in the top 5 of my new favorite places to eat. I practically cleaned my plate. I ordered the cheese crisps for the appetizer. So yummy! I also got the enchiladas del mar and it was so flavorful! I would highly recommend this place. I know you won't be disappointed.","Brunch food is cold, didn't get drinks refilled once. But the homemade tortillas are soooo good!!! As are the churros... Not having drink specials for brunch probably won't bei g me back to this place...","Delicious. We arrived at 5:00 on a Wednesday and it was packed. They were out of the yummy looking drinks they advertised and it took awhile to get served but the chips are hot and fresh and once we ordered, it was fast.  The food was yummy and the mango margarita was delicious.","We went at the height of the dinner rush on Friday.  We wanted something different outside of Surprise and this was just what we were looking for.  The place was packed.  Lots of retirees and locals it appeared.  I would give the Rio Mirage (3.5)  4 Stars overall since there is not an option for halves.   \n\nAmbience: 4 stars!  The  Rio Mirage was a nice old school mexican restaurant with plenty of seating.  Very well kept and clean. I also noticed that there was patio seating which looked comfy.  I would like to sit out there next time on a nice night.   We also loved the roaming mariachi band.  That was a nice touch and the kids loved them.  Lastly,  another note...when and if you try this place, you may expect to wait to be seated, but rest assured you won't go thirsty.  The bartender is stationed right next the entrance and the margaritas are pretty tasty.  I upgraded to the ulitmate, to get a splash of grand marnier.  3 stars on the margaritas.\n\nFood: I give the food 4 stars.   My wife ordered the fish tacos, which looked great. Fried white fish and shredded cabbage on a corn tortilla.  She gave them 2 thumbs up.   The kids had the \"Kid's Taco\" meal,  which came with a choice of beans.  They devored most of thier meals.  Their tacos were fried with shredded beef, lettuce & tomatoes.    I had the El Bombero Picado.  Strips of asada steak, covered in a green sauce with sauted peppers and onions.   It was real tasty, but was not as spicy as the menu was leading on.   However, real good.  My meal came with rice and beans on the side and a choice of tortillas.  I chose the \"homemade\" flour tortillas, 2 large tortillas (equivalent to 4 regular sized).  They were awesome.   My meal was great, I would just make a note to have them exclude the melted cheese on my beans next time.  It was a little \"overkill\" , but not a dealbreaker.  I just scraped the cheese off and it they were set.  The rice was nice and fluffy,  real subtle, with a great flavor.\n\n\nService: 2 stars.  I am giving our server the benefit of the doubt, SIMPLY because she was very friendly and helpful when we did get her attention.   She just seemed very overwhelmed and maybe she was having an \"off night\", which may likely led her to forget my tortillas after asking her twice.  Lol!  Once I get the \"homemade\" tortillas...muy bien as mentioned above.  Everyone else seemed to be getting served promptly and had smiles on their faces, which was a plus.  \n\nOverall,  I would recommend this place.  It is worth your time to try.  Remember,  avoid the rush and tell them to hold the cheese on the beans!  Good luck!","Great food and nice servers, but extremely slow! It is slow every time, but we come back for the food, it's great!","The chips and salsa were fresh, and they kept them coming without us ever having to ask for more.  I had the lunch special, Chile Relleno, with refried beans and rice, and all three items were fresh.  Can't ask for much better in Mexican food.....will definitely return again!","The only reason why I did not rate as 5 stars was the very slow end service. It took 20 minutes for the waiter to pick up the payment and cash us out. Otherwise the food was great! I will be returning.","Went in this past Sunday about 10:30. We were seated promptly by a very friendly and open Manager. Our server came quickly to take our drink orders. He was not overtly friendly or chatty, but polite and thorough. The food came quickly. I ordered the Ensenada Fish Tacos which were MASSIVE and DEVINE!! My plate also came with Beans (topped with cheese) and rice, and a side of chopped lettuce and diced tomatoes. My kids ordered a side of beans and rice which tasted fresh and which they rated as AWESOME. My husband ordered the Chicken Nachos and they were HUGE!! He said he was starving going in, but was only able to finish off half of his plate (even with some help from our 6 year old). Our food was fantastic. The chips and salsa were so good that we ordered a bag of chips and a Quart of Salsa to go! Our server came several times during the meal checking on the levels of our drinks, and refilled quickly, but wasn't so overtly chatty or buggy that he interrupted our meal or conversation. I would DEFINITELY go back again. I was happy with the food and service. \n\n** I have also had their catered Platters which are kind of pricey, but HEAVENLY!! They serve mini tacos, mini chimis and mini taquitos, with sides of sour cream, salsa and guacamole and a bag of chips. SO GOOD!","Yeah, I know what you're thinking... \"this guy leaves a lot of 5 star reviews\"... Damn right I do!!  Because the places I choose are either based off Yelp or word of mouth recommendations.\n\nAnyways, back to the review... When we visit my parents in Surprise we usually hit up Macayos... that day is done!  My wife and I agreed that Rio Mirage is added to our Phoenix Bucket List (along with In N Out and Don Pancho's).  Their food was fantastic!  I also tried their habenero salsa and it melted my face off, I had to slam 3 frozen margs till I got the sensation back in my head.  Well done Rio Mirage!  Our server rocked and as I looked around their authentic atmosphere everyone working there was busting their asses off!!  It was great to see.   My burrito was muy grande and bursting with deliciousness! \n\nI can't wait to come back for more!","This place is great! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious! You can get three sizes of margaritas (if that's your thing), sometimes for half off or for $1. My parents, boyfriend, and I went after a day out in the sun at the botanical gardens and shared a plate of nachos supreme along with a few beers. Yummy!! For $11 the nachos were more than enough for the four of us. I like how they put enchilada sauce on them. They were very accommodating putting the meat on the side and adding beans on top instead. Our waiter was really nice and made sure we had everything we needed. The front of the restaurant smelled a bit strong of cleaning products, but hey, at least I knew it was clean :) Oh, and if you want to sit on the patio, be ready to listen to the train that passes right by the place.","Soooo great place! Real Mexican food! Do not go to the same place on Bell. Service there rude! This place is amazing & relaxing!!!! 10 stars!!!","Great food and very authentic. Service was good and quick.\n\nAsk for the hot sauce but beware it has a little kick to it.","We have been coming to Rio Mirage (the original location in El Mirage) for years.  The food here is really good and we've always had great service.  The service gets a little slow on Margarita Monday, but that is expected.","Updated this review to reflect our latest experience with Rio Mirage.  Simply the best comes to mind.  A perfect dining experience!  Thank you Rio Mirage!","I have come here every time I've gone to Arizona. So when my grandma recommended we go here for authentic Mexican food and margarita's I was super stoked.\n\nSadly this place blew it on every level. When we came in we were told it was a 5 minute wait. Instead we waited 15 minutes. I didn't really care because I was hungry. We were finally sat down and I realized it was so hot in the restaurant that I started sweating.  But I was so excited for the food that I looked past this.\n\nFinally the waitress came. She recognized my grandma and remembered her order. And took it. So then it came my turn to order so I tried to order my food and drinks. The waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order. I was super confused because she took my alcohol order but wouldn't give me food. I ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks. So when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me. I told the manager he questioned my age and then tried to card me again. So I ended up getting carded twice for a drink that took me 15 minutes to get!\n\nWhile we were waiting for our drinks and food I realized it literally took 30 minutes for them to clear a table. I don't know if they were short staffed or just did not care but the restaurant was messy and the staff was super rude.\n\nBy this time I was starving, sweaty, and drunk before she even decided to take my order. This waitress what the rudest person I have ever met! I ended up ordering the enchiladas del mas. Which was a seafood enchilada. In the past they were amazing. But this time it took 30 minutes to get my food. The tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard. The fish and seafood were rubbery and the only thing that was good was the refried beans and rice. Seriously though, how hard is refried beans and rice. You can't mess that up!!! \n\nBy the end of the night I was drunk, sweaty and hungry. his was possibly the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. I have never gotten disrespected so much in a place I was a patron.\n\nIf my family hadn't gotten good service here and good food and drinks I would have complained to the manager. But since I was the only one who had an inedible meal I just left. You could not pay me to come back here. And I'm making it a point to tell the people of yelp about the horrible service I received here. DO NOT COME HERE."],"business_id":"32dee8YUFOSBDeIRmG-tPA","name":"Rio Mirage Cafe Y Cantina","categories":["Mexican","Tex-Mex","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Maribel's daily special is only $5 and it includes rice, beans, and a drink. Whaaat!? Their portions are huge for the price. I ordered my food to go, but I still received their delicious, complimentary chips and salsa. The service here is also really awesome. I was offered refills before I left. I have to come back to try all of the specials ahhh!","Food was really good!  I'll definitely go back!  It's a good no frills kind of place with good portions, great prices and excellent service!  \n\nI agree with other reviewers. It's a hidden gem!","Super good carne asada fries.

I will definitely be back for another one of those $5 deals!!","My server was very attentive and a delight in general. The food however still was not what I have been looking for in Las Vegas. I ordered my fail safe dish of cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. That being said it was still good, just not the best.

Possibly.","excellent food excellent server \"Ozzie\" always empty though fast service, good Margaritas from next dooe, One particular menu note that doesnt make any sense at all and for no reason at all--- some dinner plates come with 3 tacos.

Only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is the ambiance of the restaurant - a little outdated for decor, not a place I would typically bring people visiting.","Very Good Mexican food with great pricing. It is not the fanciest place to have Mexican Food but it is very good. I recommend the Green Chili Pork Plate and the Guacamole which is made fresh when you order it.\n\nSince the food is made to order, if you are in a hurry call and order before you go. If not, sit back and relax the service is always friendly and it is quiet enough to visit with friends or family.","This is the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas! My mom is Hispanic and I grew up on her home made enchiladas and the ones I had here were even better than hers! I told all my friends to go. It's a little hidden in the shopping center but I hope business picks up for them soon! I'll definitely go back :)","I was skeptical about this place based on the previous 1 review only yelpers but I went for it. Is it the most authentic Mexican food I ever had? NO. Was it the best Mexican food is Las Vegas? NO. Would it serve a purpose after drinking at the bar it's located in? YES. I wish I could of enjoyed the food more. The server was very friendly and the prices were fantastic. Sadly it just wasn't great tasting food.","I get take out from here every so often. Great consistency and value. I'm not a fan of how the dining room is set up, however, this has not been an issue since I have only ordered to go.","This is our new favorite.  My wife and I have been to Maribel 5-6 times since trying it after a visit to the Sprint store next door a couple months ago.\n\nWe've had the Carnitas Street Tacos, Shreaded Beef Enchiladas, and Fajitas.  All are excellent.  The rice and beans and guac are also outstanding.  \n\nOh, and the prices are fantastic.  We had dinner for two tonight; two entees, a salad big enough to share, chiips, salsa, and guac, with a fresh made warm churro for desert, for less than $25.\n\nAnd talk about authentic . . . this is a cool little family run business.  Mom Maribel is the Chef, Dad works the restaurant when not working his other job, and the three teen kids (two daughters and son) work as well . . . no other employees.  They always greet you with a smile, and really care about making it a pleasant dining experience, especially oldest daughter and main server, Ozzie.\n\nIf you want great Mexican, and want to support a locally owned business, give Maribel a try.","Just moved to Vegas and found this great Mexican restaurant. Reminds me of my moms home made plates. Can't go wrong with Maribels. Everything I've tried specially the Chilaquiles plate is my favorite.","After reading reviews here on Yelp, decided to give it a try for lunch. We were not disappointed at all. My wife and I prefer  the little, local, hole in the wall places, and this place definitely qualifies. But DO NOT let that deter you, because this little place is worth a try. \nWe started with chips and salsa and an order of guacamole. Salsa was spicy with a nice, fresh made flavor. The made fresh when you order it guac knocked our socks off, not overly spicy, but fresh, fresh, fresh...and you can't beat that. \nAnd enjoying it on fresh made tortilla chips was even better, second batch was still warm. \nFor entrees my wife went with the shredded beef tostada, I had the smothered pork chili burrito and we shared a cheese quesadilla. The best testament I can give is that we both left empty plates. Wife said the tostada was very good, with fresh veggies and a couple big slices of avacado. The pork burrito was delicious, with the right amount of spice and very flavorful pork filling. The tomatillo \"smother\" added a nice bite as well. \nServer was attentive and never let our drink glasses empty. For a price of $20 it was a very good experience.","The food was ok but just that. Salsa was kinda bland as was the rice and beans. Shredded beef tacos were best part of lunch. Not overly impressed especially considering the dining room is pretty sketchy and for whatever reason there was a sheet of plastic covering the table. Probably will find a different spot next time","Been frequenting this place weekly now for about 2 months. $5 daily specials can't be beat! Food is authentic Mexican style and very flavorful. Service is very good. Come hungry as portions are BIG! (Even with the $5 specials) I've recommended a few friends here and they enjoy it as well.","I can honestly say this place is a hidden gem! A friend and I were searching Yelp for some good Mexican food around the south Eastern area when we stumbled across this place, checked some reviews, peeped at some food pics and took the plunge! The chips to begin the meal at almost all restaurants can't hold a candle to these chips, they tasted so fresh like they had just fried up some corn tortilla's and delivered them to our table with some very good salsa. We ordered the fries with shredded beef and cheese as an appetizer. They were so good, fries were cooked perfect and had bunches of cheese and beef. My friend likes onions and I don't, so they actually made pico with no onions separately for me, that was way cool. We both ordered the three Carne Asada tacos combo, they come with pico, cilantro and limes, once again they hooked me up with onion less pico!! These taco's are a little slice of heaven, small but so full of flavor. Service was excellent, and staff was very friendly.","We had lunch today what a hidden gem... All ingredients are fresh,  family run and great tasting..... Do not let the ambiance fool you,  it's nothing fancy but the food is the best around and a great price...","My coworker told me about this place, so glad she did. Great Mexican good and made from scratch. No canned stuff here. Even our chips were handmade.","I was very impressed with the service. I enjoyed my chimichanga, which was good, but my husband had the hue so rancheros and said it was the best hed ever eaten. Thats saying a lot as he eats them wherever we go. \n\nIts a shame this place is so hard to find. It was completely dead inside - on a Friday night. We were the only customers. \n\nThey deserve better.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and check them out. The prices for the specials ($5 for a huge plate of food) are the best youll find in town. \n\nOh and even though its small, this is a sit down restaurant and not a hole in the wall.","As many know who live in Las Vegas restaurants come and go.  I am always hesitant to try out a new place especially one that is not a franchise.  After many months of passing by this place with it's one banner and little sign at the door and reading previous reviews, I decided to try it out.  Wow!!! Yum!! What they lack in atmosphere they make up for in service and food.  The waitress is one of the kindest I've ever had.  She's not afraid to suggest one of their better options, though it's all good, she didn't disappoint.  The chips, salsa and guac are delicious and fresh and they do free refills of chips and salsa!  The specials are unbeatable only $5.  I recently had the Chicken Enchiladas which were filling.  I also had a churro for dessert which was better than Disneyland!!  For three people the bill was ONLY about $20!!! I will be going back tonight to try their other appetizers and entrees :)","Very friendly staff...tacos were excellent and the elotes was wonderful. We sat outside and the owner/manager brought us our dinner while we waited with our puppy. We will definitely be back soon","Great authentic Mexican food and you do not have to spend a lot for it. Family owned and ingredients are fresh. There are daily specials and you can get inexpensive alcoholic beverages as well. It is truly a hidden gem.","Surprisingly very good. Their prices are great and the food is simple but that's how Mexican food should be. I don't need all the cheese and they do it just right. I recommend la tampiqueña and their tacos are flavorful. Their meat actually has flavor unlike other places that drench it in sauce and hope you can't tell the difference. A great choice when you want good food at a great price.","If I had been alone eating here I probably would have rated Maribel's 5 stars. However, my wife's order was fair to partly cloudy at best, probably worth 3 stars, so I'll meet in the middle with a 4 star review.\n\nLet's start with the service - our waitress was outstanding. She was attentive and gave some recommendations and also informed us of the specials throughout the week. Definitely trying to make sure we come back - which I totally appreciate. However, we placed our order when there was only one other table seated, and it took a good 35-40 minutes to get our food after we placed our order. The waitress apologized several times and even brought us a complimentary churro to apologize. The churro was outstanding. One review compared it to Disneyland churros. While I appreciate them recognizing Disney churro's as the greatest in the land, this one wasn't quite that good.\n\nSo for my entree I was simple, bean & cheese burrito. It was only $3 so I figured I'd take a stab. OUTSTANDING! Beans were really good, probably could have used a little more cheese. And they have Dr. Pepper, nothing goes better with Mexican food than an ice cold Dr. Pepper in my opinion. My wife ordered 2 cheese enchiladas, one with green sauce the other with red sauce. The green sauce was average, neither of us cared for the red sauce. They were also very, very small. I know she wouldn't order it again and I wouldn't venture out to try it - but I am interested in the carne asada which the waitress said was very good.\n\nI'm always game for a top notch bean & cheese burrito - I just hope this restaurant isn't a one trick pony because good Mexican restaurants in this city are few and far between.","A lot of food for the money.  Pretty good, not spectacular, but I do hope that this business survives.  It is in such a strange location (inside Doc Holliday's) with almost no signage outside.  The inside is a big room with old booths, a concrete floor, and minimal not particularly attractive decor.  \n\nWe will probably eat there again (or get take-out), but Maribel makes me appreciate the charm and food quality at Las Cazuelas, the other pretty new place located in the same shopping center.  LC serves smaller portions but the food is regional Mexican (not your typical fare) of excellent quality.  The people serving us at both restaurants were very nice which is one reason I hope both of them survive.\n\nBottom line:  If we want ambiance and excellent authentic food we will go to Las Cazuelas.  If we want good food and a lot of leftovers, we will go to Maribel's.","If you know me you know I love Mexican food. Maribel's is doing it BIG over here and at low price. \n\nIt's nothing fancy here so if you need to be seen or require a mariachi band killing your ear drums than this is not for you. \n\nThe menu is limited and at the same time everything I have tried has been stellar.\n1. Chicken taco combo (3 street tacos, rice , beans) $6. All white meat chicken seasoned well. It's going to be hard to try more of the menu because this my shit. \n2. Carne Asada taco combo- same as above and real good. \n3. Chicken Enchiladas (comes with two) - Pretty damn good. \n\nI LOVE their guacamole, homemade chips and red salsa, rice and beans. I bet even just a bean burrito or breakfast burrito would be bomb here. \n\nPoint is food is solid, affordable and it's a local family owned business. I have to give props to the server Ozzy (I hope that's her name. It may be Izzy. I know I suck.) Her service is on point and she remembers me which scores major points and tips. \n\n\nMaribel's gets the World Cup of Mexican Food for Green Valley. Nacho Daddy can drown in their scorpion shots and well Lindo is Lindo. I'll be right here with my homies.","Fresh, fresh, fresh! The guacamole and fish tacos were the best I've ever had - tacos double wrapped. This is on track to become our favorite family hangout.","Without going into too much detail because I don't have a lot of time, this place is awesome.  It's comfy, great location, welcoming, and most importantly, DELICIOUS.  The prices are awesome, and the staff (from the couple times we've seen) is the children of the owners.  But they always get the orders right and are friendly.  The parents have done a good job raising kids AND training them with good work ethic.  If you're looking for an awesome place to eat, give this place a try.","I was pleasantly surprised by my entire experience here.  From the outside you see 1 single banner thats easily over seen by the Doc Holiday's signs that take over the entire building, but I'm glad I took the time to stop in and have the best mexican food I have had in Las Vegas.\nI have lived in Las Vegas and have tried lots of mexican restaurant this city has to offer, and this one was by far my favorite. When you first walk in you aren't overwhelmed with loud hispanic music and dim red lighting (like every other cantina in Las Vegas), You are greeted with the family who runs the whole operation. The decor was simple,  but it obviously wasn't the focus, because the food and the service was the real star.\n I ordered a the chicken enchilada meal. It came with a drink, rice, beans, and 2 enchilada's, which is more than enough food. Get this, it was 5 dollars! thats a deal! it cost more to eat at Roberto's and I wasn't violently attacked from the food 30 minutes later like I am when I go to Roberto's or Faustos. obviously I was excited that it was so keep, but it was absolutely delicious. you can tell that the chicken was seasoned, moist, and made with love. \nOur server was a young boy, probably about 13 or 14. whenever I go to a family restaurant and the service is by the children, it can be awkward and kinda painful to watch these young kids try and interact with adults and do a good job, but not for this kid. He was bright, lively, and not awkward at all. He was very quick to have combacks to our jokes, and was very good at answering our questions. Not to mention he gave us better service than that of adults at far more expensive restaurants.\n\nI will gladly comeback, and I am constantly telling everyone I know about this place.","I've lived in Silverado Ranch for a long time, and I'm constantly hunting for a good Mexican restaurant. This place recently opened in the Doc Holliday's across from Michael's. My family checked it out, really liked it, and then took me there last night. It's really, really good food! Very authentic Mexican food with huge portions, and ridiculously cheap. I had a 3 taco combo (2 chicken and 1 carne asada), it came with rice and beans and was way more than anyone should eat in one sitting. It was $6! For 3 of us, dinner was $23. You absolutely cannot find food like this anywhere else in Silverado Ranch.\n\nMy dad chatted with the owner, and the place is family owned and operated. It's a sweet family, and they put their blood, sweat, and tears into the place. They've got it painted and spruced up really nice. It's clean and cozy inside. \n\nI gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because its new and they're still getting started. I'd really like to see this place do well, so I can keep going back!","Awesome food! Owner is great! He'll be happy to accommodate dietary restrictions! I had fantastic veggie fajitas with corn tortillas. Yummy!","Amazing food and an amazing price! Will be going weekly. Have had many items and nothing has disappointed.","You know, this place really sticks out among Mexican restaurants. For one, the food is fresh, and entirely handmade. Second, it is tasty! Their salsas and sauces are fantastically spicy and smoky. \n\nNot many of their dishes are vegetarian friendly as written, but they made the special point of telling us that they would do as much as possible to accommodate us, and essentially made us entirely new dishes. \n\nDefinitely recommend!"],"business_id":"3FhOLs1Sxc89loLnIAQl1g","name":"Maribel Mexican Food & More","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!","I have been a patron of this local,  fairly traditional spot for nearly 40 years!  I actually once worked at the one on 32nd Street and Indian School for a week.\n\nThe salsa I can eat as a soup.  Nice and chunky, fresh, all around yummy.  The spicier salsa can be slightly dipped in periodically as necessary for an added hotttttness.  \n\nThe menu hasn't changed much over the years.  The food is fresh and if not too careful could border non-authentic.  Overall, this is a great place you can count on for a sweet Mexican food experience.\n\nMy granddaughter and I are now the matriarch's in the family to continue the tradition of being loyal to this landmark!","Love this place and come here every time I'm in town. The servers are a bit dingy at times, I've had orders messed up a few times, billing errors, etc.... I don't mind too much as long as thing are straightened out, which they are.\n\nThe burritos are awesome, love the warm tortilla chips served with salsa. Best cheese crisp around (better than Los Olivos) and did I mention consistency? Never a surprise here. This is good food and we'll keep coming...","Great service, food, and atmosphere.","I've been patronizing Manuel's (this location) for 20+ years.  The chips always arrive nice and warm.  I've never had a bad meal at this location.  I believe the wait staff makes this place that much better.  They always are so welcoming and very attentive.  This is our go to place for special events.","This place is very overrated. Food will cost you 15-20 dollars per person, and you can get much better from traditional Mexican diners at half the price. Service was not good, and the food was not good. I had Fajitas, and Applebee's produces a better product. Will not go back again, and in an area dominated by a lot of quality Mexican cuisine, this is a place to skip","Love this place.  Come here weekly to meet with friends. Always good service.  Always delish food.","Great food...been eating here for thirty plus years. Food has the same top quality since I started eating here. Like family here....love the food! Best Mexican food!","Service here varies on the person and day of the week.\nFood always looks like it was microwaved. So awful. \nOnly reason I gave it two stars was because of the drinks.","It isn't well known but each Manuel's is owned by one of the children of the original owner- the best one is on Peoria, that is one that you hear good things about.","I ate lunch here a few weeks ago and had a good, cheap, quick meal.  $6.99 for an enchilada, taco, rice and beans...what a deal!  Good chips and salsa too!","Not bad at all.\n\nWe had the red chili con carne burro and mexican pizza.  The meat in the burro could have been shredded a bit more but the flavor was nice.  I also like the little bed of shredded lettuce it comes on to help with the heaviness of the plate.  The Mexi pizza could have been a little easier on cheese and sliced olives all over it would have been nice.  But it was tasty enough.\n\nThe service was very good by the helper/busboy person but the waiter was a little on the slow side.  I'd like to check out their happy hour.","OK for food. it falls into one of my routine lunch places if I run out of ideas. good for margaritas.","I like the fact the food came out so fast once ordered! & especially during the lunch hour! Staff was friendly & helpful. The & lunch specials were good portions & great price!","Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!","Not too shabby. Pretty standard menu of mexican food.  The food comes out fast and piping hot.  I had the carnitas chimichanga and it was really good.  The guac served on top was delicious and not all runny like some others in town.  The margaritas are big, delicious and fairly priced.  Oh!  And you get free chips and salsa if you're ordering a meal.  Love me some chips and salsa, especially when the mild is so tasty.  I would go back to Manuel's to try a bit more of the menu and to take advantage of happy hour margaritas!","This is so difficult.  I guess the best I can say is that Manuel's is like the TV dinner of Mexican Food.  This stuff is so gringo-ized that it's Mexican in name only.  I had the Pollo Especial.  It was nothing special.  Chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla, deep fried and some cream-cheese sauce slathered on it.  Rice and Beans that tasted like they came straight from a can to the microwave to my plate.  The free chips and salsa (hot sauce) was not bad, as was the beer.   That's about the best I can come up with for the food.  It won't threaten your taste buds.  It might threaten your wallet however, as nothing seemed to be less than eleven dollars.\n\nService was satisfactory, a bit slow on the takeoff, but adequate.  I don't normally concern myself with room layouts, but in this room, we had to weave between tables bunched so close together, it was a bit disconcerting.  I sure don't want to stare at somebody's passing arse two feet away bumping my table while  I'm eating. There was no getting to the middle of the room - fortunately it was not that big of a room and the servers could just pass food to the unfortunate diners stuck in the middle.   I was grateful to be in a booth, despite being stuck in a corner, at least nobody was behind me.\n\nWould I go back?  Only if you forced me.","Excellent service, great food. Nachitos came out and made me laugh, as the name implies that they are small. They are not. Great fajitas too.","Is it Authentic? - yes.\n\nBut...I wanted to like this place and I can't. Maybe because I'm not a fan over-salted greasy sonoran food with the loud speakers from an over-amplified one man band 5 feet from my ears while I'm trying to hold a conversation. The indigestion was not a pleasant souvenir.\n\nIf I want very loud music, I'll go to a concert but it's not appropriate at a \"family restaurant\".  Put it this way - my (almost) 4 year old was on the edge of tears because her ears were hurting from the crappy music.  \n\nNext time I'm here and want Mexican food, I think I'll just go to Teakwoods Tavern in the same parking lot and order Nacho's and a bucket of Coronas instead.","Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and you'll leave satisfied.","I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting.","I have been to other Manuel's in the past and a couple weeks ago I just wanted to have so good 'bad' Mexican food, so we went here. This was a huge disappointment. The BF and I got very 'easy' and Americanized dishes- I got a cheese crisp and rice and he got a bean and cheese burrito. I will say the cheese crisp was pretty disappointing. It had no flavor at all....none of that delicious cheesy goodness that is the essence of Americanized Mexican food.... I definitely will not be back here again.","Love Manuel's!  Always good food and a friendly staff.","Had dinner here with a friend on 6/1/2013. What's not to like? It's close by, has a nice atmosphere, great service and reasonable prices. I had the mini steak tacos and edamame. Yes, I'll be back.","I haven't  been to Manuel's in awhile and as always the food was really good. We were seated in a back room close to the kitchen. I'm always cold but I was roasting in that room. The waiter took great care of us and I loved the margaritas.","If you want old fashioned good Mexican food, this is the place.  The food is fresh, standard style of sauces, beans, rice, salsas... bar, very good service, very friendly staff.  Wifi too.  It's a good place to go and get an enchilada or carne asada.  The staff deserves 5 stars.. it's clean, it's convenient, and it is fast.","My boss and I ate there yesterday. I really like their chips and salsa. We had the lunch specials. Chimichangas. I think it cost us 20 bucks for our lunch. It was pleasant and we got our food pretty quickly. I'd go there again for lunch.","Went here the other day for a chimi and a marg. One of my friends had recommended it as being a little better than most \"border food\" places.  I have to say, I was walking in expecting very little. Every bible belt fatty from the midwest was there, acting like white trash, mispronouncing every word on the menu. I'm sure you can picture the type I'm trying to describe. I made my way to the bar and watched the baseball game during lunch, even though it wasn't on when I came in. The bartender was extremely accommodating and the service was great from start to finish. I ordered the green chili chimi and it was actually much, much, better than I had expected. I actually enjoyed the dish. The margarita was weak, and wouldn't recommend that, but the food and service here are actually pretty good. Take it for what it is though, as it is still greasy, heavy, border food.","This food was pretty good, nothing spectacular. The wait staff is excellent, very attentive and helpful. The taquitos are crispy and have decent flavor. The rice is a little mushy, but has good flavor as well.","I have been going here practically my whole life. It is my favorite mexican restaurant. It's not fancy, but it's not run down either - it's just right. The waiters are also always very nice.\n\nI'm a total salsa snob and their chunky salsa is the best salsa ever. The hot sauce is also highly ranked in my book. I've had their cheese crisp, enchiladas, chimis - basic stuff like that. \nTheir fried ice cream is really good too!\n\nAnd the best part about it is that the salsa is wonderful at their different locations too. I'm just partial to this location since it's been the one I go to the most.\nVery reasonable prices too.\n\nTry them out!","Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get takeout right. I ordered the same thing at Manuel's that I typically order at Tee Pee. The takeout was 100% better. Crisp, neat and tasted fantastic. I'd recommend Manuel's over Tee Pee if you're looking for good takeout.","Eight of us went to Manuel's today for lunch, and I can say that the service was the WORST I have ever seen in any restaurant.  \n\nSix of us got our meals at the same time, while the other two (who ordered the daily special) got theirs  EIGHT MINUTES AFTER the rest of us.  \n\nWe didn't see the server again until he brought our bill.  We had asked him for separate tickets...and only got one.  We never got a single refill on the iced teas that four of us paid $2.50 each for...ten bucks would buy a LOT of tea bags.\n\nAn 84-year-old woman in our party asked for her water in a styrofoam cup with a straw, which the server said he would bring her but he never did.\n\nThe food was unimpressive...greasy and fried.  I would go to Taco Bell before I went back to Manuel's, which is overpriced.  I wouldn't have minded the mediocre food, but the service sucks like an Electrolux.","What can I say about Manuel's? Well some locations are better than others. The one in Phoenix is on the old and dirty side, but the ones in Scottsdale and Mesa are nicer. The food is good, but a little greasy. I love their chips and salsa (all you can eat). Their prices are reasonable and they have a lot of items to choose from.","I write this review as I finish the second of two lime candies that were given to me along with the check. While that part comes last, I feel the need to comment on how good those things are. They are exponentially better than peppermint candies that are ubiquitous at family restaurants. \n\nAnyway, that's probably not why you're here reading this review. Manuel's provided exactly what I was looking for--great Sonoran Mexican food and a down-to-each, low-key atmosphere to go along with it. The experience started off walking into the building, which is located in a strip mall. The building itself seemed to be older than the rest of the mall. Anyway, it worked. The interior is standard 1980s Mexican with the terra cotta tiles all over and sombreros gracing the walls and ceiling. Pretty much sets up the experience the way is should be. Two waiters both tended to the table, answered questions, took part of the order, and continued to serve us through the whole meal. Not only were they both affable, we got twice the attention!\n\nThe recommendations they provided were genuine; not limited to \"people like this...\" No, both waiters told us exactly what they liked and gave reasons. The entrees were preceded by some pretty tasty salsas (yes, two o' them!) and chips and a cheese crisp, which we ordered from the appetizers.\n\nThe two of us who dined there had carnitas and the three amigos enchiladas, both which came with rave reviews. If you're not looking for three enchiladas, may I recommend the spinach with white sauce. Neither disappointed. It's true, you need to like cheese and a little grease with you food. But that's exactly why you'd be at this restaurant.","Not like my neighborhood Manuels. This place was cold, the service was sparse, and the food was horrible. Stay away.","I have been coming here for years and I keep coming back. Yes, it's an older building but it feels authentic. Hot sauce is one of the best in town. Order the cheese crisp, extra cheese and extra crispy. Yum!","It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. \n\nI've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. \n\nOur food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more \"juice\" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. \n\nI've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)","Not great, but not terrible either.\n\nPros: My wife liked the salsa, but I say it's just okay. You get two different types, and the red salsa they give you just tastes like a mix of Hormel chili and ketchup.\n\n-Taco; Really liked the shell; it was like you get at a street vendor, seemingly just-cooked and folded. The chicken inside also tasted \"homey,\" like chicken you boiled for hours to make a soup till it was tender. Very brothy and nice.\n\n-Speed; our food was out in a matter of minutes. Kinda scary, actually, as one reviewer put it. Is everything frozen and reheated? Didn't seem that way, as I said my taco was pretty good. But who knows?\n\nCons: -Lack of spice; nothing on either of our plates had any spice. That said, I feel this place is definitely Mexican food for dumb Americans who can't handle it. Not that I'm looking to burn my mouth on every bite, but a hint of something here and there wouldn't hurt.\n\nMost everything else about this place is unimpressive, but passable. The decor is what you'd expect, service is decent, prices okay I guess. I'm not sure why other reviewers think this place looks dumpy, seemed clean and presentable to me. I'd say \"in a pinch, it'll do,\" but with so many other Mexican places around that's meaningless and Manuel's is just a face in the crowd.\n\nBottom-line: Go here if you want typical Mexican with a slightly better-than-average dining room atmosphere.","This is part of a local chain, this location is the missing-link in the chain.  This location is in an older part of Phoenix not a location for the tourist.  \nI can only compare this place to my high school cafeteria during \"Mexican\" food day.  The place is as cozy as a cafeteria, the servers must have been trained by the \"lunch ladies\", the noise from the children is only outdone by the screaming parents and the food is a step below Taco Bell.  If you are looking for Mexican food head back to high school.  In a city full of Mexican restaurants you can find a better place by throwing a dart at the map."],"business_id":"69t2S1u7Rf6qM_c14b42xQ","name":"Manuel's Mexican Restaurant","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["The margaritas here are so so so so so so good, the best ones this side of manhattan! Food is super good, service is friendly and scarily speedy and the restaurant itself is tiny and cute as! Seriously go, go! I'd hazard a guess at saying it's the best 'mexican' in edinburgh.","Mexican food in the UK has been grievously disappointing, both in price and representation.  Gone are the days when $4 can score me a half-pounder cabaza/lengua burrito.\n\nTex Mex was the last I expected this far up north.  Scotland rocks.\n\nLet's do this bullet-point style:\n\nMargaritas - decent tequila content and thoroughly slushed.  Nothing more annoying that semi-icy concoctions that don't travel up straws well.\n\nMuch respect for carrying Dos Equis, Corona, Sol, Modelo and that obscure little label Pacifico.\n\nTequila - they carry the good stuff; these guys have done their homework.  Gun for the Anejos.  Don Julio Gold Anejo was my pick.\n\nFloutas - more like giant taquitos, the corn tostada-wrapped chicken is deep fried to crunchy perfection.  Topped off with salsa, sour cream and guac it's what I'd expect to see in higher-end Mexican restaurants in LA or San Diego.\n\nCarnitas - the pork was served in cubes and was much too salty, unfortunately.\n\nEnchiladas - covered in a healthy layer of cheese to be called such, it's an accurate enough representation of what my Mexican friends' moms would make at home. Approved.","This place is ok, I wanted to check it out for a while but found it ok.\nThe drinks are probably the tastiest things on the menu.\nThe food was again ok but not so special, there was too much cheese and the actual portions were a bit small.\nAll in all not bad but not so good.","Tex Mex 2 has the best British Tex Mex I've had since moving to the UK. They're Spinach Enchilada (with re-fried beans in place of the chilies for me) manages my cravings every time I get a bit homesick. \n\nPrice is important to me, and this is a place I can afford to eat at on a more regular basis - not to mention the decent amount of food you get for your money. The frozen margarita's and burgers aren't to be missed either!\n\nThe staff is very friendly and manage to squeeze us in each time we phone ahead or rock up without calling.","After reading the reviews about the margaritas I'm a little gutted that I haven't had the opportunity to taste one for myself, but I absolutely hate tequila so it's probably not the best idea.\n\nIf you're looking for some Mexican food then I can heartily recommend Tex Mex 2, it offers a nice, vibrant restaurant with friendly staff and a chilled out atmosphere, an excellent menu with delicious food and the prices aren't bad either.\n\nThumbs up.","Reasonable Mexican food at rock-bottom prices. Great cocktails too. I went with a large group of people on a hot day and it was a little uncomfortable in the small dining area - most people had to go outside at some point for air. Other than that we all had a nice meal and were impressed by the service.","Another pleasant surprise from recent weeks!\n\nNow, Wahaca of London fame, this is what I wanted you to be... great Mexican food with a genuine twist. \n\nTo be honest the name and sign had me write this place off initially, despite having heard good things and being near so other fine Thistle Street establishments, but I'm glad I caved one afternoon and came by. \n\nThe frozen Margarita starter, which is just me having a drink, was quite nice... it seemed a fine mix if what I was used to in the US and what I've gotten used to here and I loved that you could get them in baby pitcher sizes... I'm sure there's a fancier name for the baby pitchers, but it escapes me. Carafe? Moving on!\n\nI ended up with two actual starters in and a side of refried beans in leu of an actual main... I did want the tuna, it sounded fantastic, but unfortunately they had run out of tuna that day so it wasn't meant to be.\n\nThe Chile Rellenos I had were smaller peppers than I'm used to, but definitely had a good flavour... when querying things the waiter even admitted they weren't his favourite, which I'm a big fan of... honesty, that is. \n\nThe star of the show this afternoon was the Soft Shell Crab Flautas... wow! (Unlike the Chile Rellenos the waiter expressed his love for these, which was well founded.) They're definitely on my list to try again, and gleefully come with the tuna as a side so here's hoping if manage to get the two together next visit. \n\nThe refried beans were also a treat... I loved that there was something to them with the spring onions and pink peppercorns... definitely impressed. \n\nFrom what I saw of other people's dishes I didn't see anything that made me cringe or look even remotely bad, always a good sign. \n\nTrue to their menu they have some random hot sauces... they gave me one simply called \"Pain 100%\", and it definitely lived up to it's name. If anything this was my one slight gripe this visit however... I didn't get a really good hot sauce, the initial ones I was offered (while having good taste), weren't too hot and the Pain 100% was a bit over the top sacrificing too much flavour for immense heat. They had a few others, so hopefully I'll get to sample more of the range on another visit.\n\n(Side Note: where was this complimentary spicy popcorn everyone raves about?!?)\n\nSo, Tex Mex II, with your shopping-mall worthy name and funny purple sign you've still won me over... good on you, I'll definitely be back.","I went here last night for a friend's birthday dinner, never hearing anything about it before (I didn't even look at yelp!). Sometimes it's best to have an unbiased opinion beforehand. I was so excited to have some margaritas and tasty tacos, because it has been quite a while since I had either. I was blown away by the quality of food here. I started out with an order of guacamole, which is some of the best I've ever had, even in Mexico. Big chunks of tomato, scallions, cilantro, perfectly mashed avocado, it was delicious. For my main course, I opted for the chicken tacos, which were equally as amazing and full of flavor. Two perfectly sized taco shells filled with large chucks of seasoned chicken breast, and a heap of guacamole, sour cream and salsa on top. Finishing the dish was a side of spanish rice and tiny salad. Excellent food, it felt like I was in Texas or California instead of rainy Edinburgh.\n\nAlso, the prices are unbeatable. About £9 for the tacos, £4 for the guac, and the drink prices are cheap, especially for mixed drinks. Around £3.50 for a margarita, or split a pitcher with 3 people for £11 and get two drinks per person for the price of one margarita. Cute and homey decor, comfortable seats, and candles all around the restaurant. I'd go back here in a heartbeat.","I'm going to have to downgrade, unfortunately.\n\nI've visited Tex Mex 2 a few times now and have had really varied experiences.  This time, our server was great but the food left a lot to be desired.  \n\nI ordered the carnitas tacos and was delivered a plate of meat, with a small side salad, a little rice and small blobs of sauces.  The tacos had more meat in them than I expect you're meant to consume in a week, let alone a meal.  Yeah this doesn't sound like a bad thing - value for money and all- but it was.  They were so meaty that I actually only managed half of a taco before I just felt unwell.  A taco is meant to have meat, veggies, beans, cheese, etcetc not... meat. period. end of story.  \n\nAdd to this the fact that the carnitas were *incredibly* salty.  Really really really really salty, and kind of sicky sweet too?  It certainly didn't taste like any carnitas I've had before, and the saltiness was painfully over the top.\n\nFortunately we were able to take our food away and the leftover carnitas (with rice and beans and veggies, like they were meant to be!) were enough for the two of us to have tacos for dinner a few nights later.  \n\nI would suggest lowering the prices and cutting down on the meat (and salt!).  Until that happens, I don't see myself returning.  \n\n(I've actually just read my previous review... if only I'd read that before ordering the *same* dish again!  d'oh)","Holy frozen margarita batman. Tex Mex 2 will forever be remembered for the place I had my first frozen margarita. And at £3.75 a damned good value one at that. Actually, they deserve more hype than this...\n\nYOU CAN GET MARGARITAS FOR £3.75 HERE!\n\nMost cocktail bars sell 'em for £6 but seriously these are as good as they come, and the tequila has a particularly nice edge.\n\n Now I know why they get so much hype the other side o the pond, I just like the ones we get here because I'm a tequila fiend.\n\nThe evening started off with a frozen margarita, which was large, refreshing and tasty. Miss Emily V and I were in a tex-mex'in kinda mood so she went for carnitas tacos and I had the tuna special dish - seared tuna with two crab taco things.\n\nThe food was really quite tasty, I finished all of mine and Emily was just defeated by the last few mouthfuls. C'mon, it's tex mex. The only thing was that my tuna was well done. The waiter specifically asked me how I'd like it done which I took as a good sign that they *know* tuna should be raw in the middle. So when I said 'medium rare' and it came out well done, that was a disappintment. By itself I probably wouldn't have been happy with the meal, but the crab tacos that came with it were super tasty. Stuffed with freat, juicy crab meat, a little cheese, thin tacos fried. Yum. Emily's carnitas tacos had a really nice flavour but were swimming in sauce she looked very tricky to pick up. I had also assumed they would be drier and less saucy and thus hand-food. Either way they were also enjoyed.\n\nThe waiter was really friendly, the decor is cute, fun, bright and in yo' face. It's a small joint, probably only seats about 15 and tucked up Thistle Street it's not one you'd normally wander by. I've still to eat more Mexican in the city but as far as it goes, this was tasty, good value and had margaritas aplenty.\n\nI signed up for their newsletter online that day and received a 20% off voucher for the meal. Pretty nifty!","Sadly I was not impressed with my food this time around. \n\nI ordered the carnitas chimichanga and didn't expect my chimichanga to be entirely full of meat! Yes, no beans or rice or veg, only MEAT. That is more meat that I eat in an entire week. Not impressed.\n\nThere was salsa on top of it but would have much rather it had been inside the burrito to give some relief from the meat fest. Also the carnitas meat was way too seasoned. It didn't have that fresh taste that I expect from mexican food. Mexican food has a lot of veg and not so much meat. \n\nSo, I ate like a quarter of the chimichanga before I felt like I might pass out. I brought the rest home and my partner had the rest for lunch and let me tell you he can pack it away and this thing filled him up. completely. \n\nAll in all I guess many would think good value for money, yes, if you like LOTS of meat. Otherwise it would be better if they lowered the price a wee bit and put a fraction of meat in their chimichangas and add some beans and rice and veg.","Hmm oh dear, how the great can fall. I came here for a wee birthday dinner with some friends as last time Emily V and I came we really enjoyed it.\n\nThe food was still good, if in fact even better. I ordered the same combo platter of tuna with crab flautus and this time my tuna was actually rare as requested (if a little cold). And the margaritas are goooood. I do need to give them that.\n\nBut the service left a lot to be desired. The waiter was friendly, and smiling, and seemed like a nice guy. But it was incredibly slow, at times bordering on arrogant, and very cheeky.\n\nI arrived 10 minutes early to find Emily V already early herself. Waiting for two others, we sat. And waited. We were one of two tables. I saw many members of staff wandering to and fro. The waiter didn't look busy. He never came over to our table but when I finally managed to catch his attention and ask \"could we please order some drinks?\" he responded with \"yeah I'll be over in a bit\" in a very nonchalent manner. \"In a bit\". Not a case of \"oh yes I'll be over\" whilst grabbing his note pad. It was literally a case of \"I'm not yet taking drinks orders\". A bit turned out to be 10 minutes.\n\nFine during the meal itself, but when it came to paying we paid by cash. It was taken away, and not returned. We waited again. And waited. And saw him clearing tables, serving other people, still no change. Eventually, the polite Brit in me overcame my anxiety of appearing rude myself and asked for the change, to which he brought it over straight away. This makes me think he was hoping we wouldn't ask for the change and leave the in excess of 20% change as tip. Which was really quite ironic considering how slow and nonchalent the service had been.\n\nIt was also quite cold in the restaurant when we first got there and I didn't take my jacket off until the mains arrived. A small note but when you're eating hot, spicy mexican food you kind of want to feel hot and spicy not shivering.\n\nNow I don't know if I would go back. Their margaritas really are sooooo good and great value. I like I said the staff were nice, not flat out rude, but their attitude of 'serving us when it suited them' and the very cheeky trick with the change put me off slightly.","Good quality Tex Mex fare, in Edinburgh's wonderful Thistle Street. We summed it up: \"the best tex-mex/Mexican food we've had outside of the States, which says a lot.\"","I was surprised to discover this was the first Mexican restaurant to open in the whole of Scotland. Ever since 1984 they seem to have been refining their speciality frozen margarita as it's a crowd pleaser. The concoction of lime juice, tequila and triple sec seems to be just right, leaving you willing to delve into their Mexican fare.\n\nThe food offerings are decent enough with the nice touch of a real salad instead of the usual carrot shavings and a wilted leaf. \n\nTop stuff!","I had heard good things about this place so I thought it was worth a try. It was a wet Monday evening so it was pretty quiet, just as well because this place is tiny! \n\nWhen you sit down you are given a rather interesting bowl of popcorn. We don't do much with popcorn in the UK apart from salt or sugar it, so I was pleasantly surprised by the popcorn spiced goodness. The food was okay, I rather enjoyed my Chimichangas, even I ordered it just for the name. My boyfriend got the impression his came out the microwave. It resembled a microwave meal and I guess he felt it tasted the same, so he wasn't very impressed. Plus the food came out so quickly you always kind of wonder if it is freshly made. I don't know for sure, maybe it is worth trying again as this place has been around for so long that perhaps we just went on an off night.","Right! Time for an update! I've been back a couple of times since I wrote my last review. More recently on Saturday with my boyfriend who has never been before. One word. YUUUUUUMM!!!! The decor is nothing fancy but I honestly can't say I've had better Mexican food anywhere else. Instead of my usual beef burrito I thought I'd change and go for the popular speciality of pork carnitas (basically a slow cooked pork stew served with guac, salsa, sour cream, salad and soft tortillas). I died and went to heaven!! Although full, I refused to let go off plate until every scrap of food was gone from it. Who knew that a pork stew could be so tasty?!! Everything is clearly homemade and beautifully presented. These people care about food and they care about good service! My bf did the obligatory\n\"Hot sauce challenge\" and was presented with a series of hot sauces to try including one which was so hot they are not allowed to serve it with food. I laughed while he coughed and spluttered. A small dish of yoghurt was given to him to neutralize the heat. Men! \nMargaritas = amazing! \nFood = amazing!\nService = these guys care and want you to come back! \nI've now upper rating to 5 stars.","I spent the third year of my Degree in South America, and the thing I miss most since I came back is the food. Which is why I love this place so much - it's by far the most authentic restaurant of this type that I've found in the whole city.\n\nAnd it's great value for money too. The main courses are all under £10 and the starters are all under a fiver... which means more money for their amazing Margaritas or frozen Daiquiris, which is never a bad thing! The best thing is their set-price lunch menu: only £8.50 for two courses or £11 for three courses means that you really can't go wrong. In particular, the crispy Flautas are definitely worth trying. Especially if you're hungry, as the portions are enormous here.","For now this is the best Mexican food in Edinburgh in my humble opinion. It is true I have yet to try a few other places but for now this one is it.\n\nEverything tasted fresh and packed a punch! Just the way I like it! The waiter was a really nice lad who even went as far as to show me the kitchen and the burrito making station. So I can vouch that everything is super fresh and handmade. The pico de gallo is chunky cause they cut it that way by hand!  I have yet to try the Nachos which were merely mentioned in another review but now I am on a mission.\n\nExpect another review (with more detail) coming soon...","i love tex mex food!!  love it!!!  i'm not sure how someone couldn't though, i mean cheese, salsa, guacamole, and MARGARITAS!!!  that is a recipe for tasty goodness!  except on moving to Edinburgh i thought i had left behind good tex mex along with bagels, proper sandwiches, and broccoli cheese soup from Panera BUT then i found Tex Mex 2.  this restuarant has become my brightly coloured beacon for the best mexican food in the scottish capital.\n\nThe menu has a good variety of choices, but i have three favourite items that i always order:\n\n1. The margaritas!!  Usually i shun anything that contains tequlia due to some bad drunken Uni memories, but in these margaritas you can hardly taste it.  i love that they come in a variety of flavours, my favourite is the wild cherry.  however, i can also recommend the peach, passionfruit, and mango.  all very good and a pitcherful of this tasty drink never goes amiss ;)\n\n2. the grande nachos my absolute favourite savory indulgence food!  there is nothing better than a plate full of crispy tortilla chips, melty cheese, garlicy guacamole, homemade refried beans, fresh salsa, and sour cream.  most nachos i've tried in Edinburgh fall short of my high expectations, but not the ones in Tex Mex 2!  the plate is piled high with all this goodness and i want to dig in before the waiter puts the plate on the table....\n\n3. the carnitas!  there are a few ways to get carnitas at this restuarant.  the traditional way in a bowl with grilled tortillas and all the toppings on the side, in a burrito, or in a chimichanga.  all three ways are very very good but my favourite is the traditional way except that the portion is so huge that i can't even eat half of it!  maybe that has more to do with sharing a starter of their nachos grande though....\n\nthere are many more delicious options on this menu, but i tend to only order my favourites.  however, those options keep me coming back so nothing wrong with sticking to what works!  already looking forward to a wild cherry margarita at my next visit :)","Mexican food in the UK?  You can understand I was pretty skeptical - no offense, but this is not something that your country has down.  But my expat friend recommended it, and she did not lead us astray!\n\nCame for lunch on a Sunday, they opened up at noon.  Interior is small, but bright, colorful, and cheery.  Service was some of the friendliest I'd had in the UK.  They put a little plate of spicy popcorn on the table, which is a nice touch, and much less filling than the loads of chips/salsa you'd get at a Mexican restaurant in the US - for better or for worse.  I got the veggie fajitas and my boyfriend got the carnitas burrito, which he'd been craving all day - and a side of chips, despite my protest that that was a strange accompaniment to Mexican food.\n\nMy fajitas were really nice and light - just squash, mango, and regular fajita veg flambeed with tequila (in front of me!) and lightly seasoned - delicious in a tortilla with salsa and guac.  Definitely needed some hot sauce though!  Didn't try  my boyfriend's burrito, which he really liked, but wow was it messy!  When he cut into it, sauce just poured out.  I munched on the hot, crispy chips, loving them as I thought to myself \"why am I eating fries with Mexican food?\"\n\nIt's a bit pricey, but it's competitive in terms of taste with Mexican-American food, and that's all I'd hoped for!  Oh - nothing is that spicy though.  They have a bunch of hot sauces displayed, they gave my boyfriend the mildest which he tried and immediately asked for two levels up.  He tried that one and asked for one more.  They had to check and see if they had any of the hottest one, finally bringing it -  more of a chile paste, really - in a bowl.  Even THAT was spicy, but not so bad!  I had a dollop on a chip and it was spicy, but not what you'd expect from what is literally the spiciest sauce in the house!  That's the one thing I'd ask from Tex Mex II - turn up the heat, guys!","I updated my FB status on my way to Tex Mex 2 yesterday, moaning about bus journeys during the festival.  Jenny L responded to say \"There's a margarita at the end of that bus journey don't you worry. \"\nAnd there was, and it was good.  \n\nYou don't often see blended/frozen margaritas over here but they were quite tasty and quite reasonably priced as well.  I think next time I'll opt for a pitcher, if I do say so myself.\n\nJenny L and I had been planning our meal here from about 10 that morning, so we both had plenty of time to peruse the menu and make the agonizing decision about just WHAT we would be eating; it all sounded so amazing.  \n\nWe decided to skip starters to ensure plenty of space for our mains.  This turned out to be a very good plan, though the loaded nachos will definitely be the go next time I'm here.\n\nI went for the crispy carnitas tacos, while Jenny went for the seared tuna with crab flautas.  The tuna was a bit overdone in our opinion but we both enjoyed the flautas. \nI love carnitas, and they make fantastic tacos, but these were a bit TOO saucy.  I'm used to being able to pick up a crunchy taco and eat it properly, but I had to wait until the taco was soggy enough to use a knife and fork, which kind of defeated the whole \"crunchy\" business in my mind... \nI'm also one of those people who just doesn't use salt, so the carnitas, while wonderfully flavoured, came across as just a bit too salty for me.\n\nThat being said, though, the tacos were heaped with amazing guacamole, sour cream, salsa, salad, you name it, it was there.  \n\nI am definitely looking forward to a return visit here, but I will probably try something different.","Wow. Nothing wrong with this little place. I Yelped for a decent restaurant in the New Town section and this caught my eye along with a nice recommend from Emily V. \n\nJust me and the kids. Thing 1 and Thing 2 split some nachos and I had the Colorado Burrito and a margarita. Fast and friendly service and great tasting, fresh, savory, authentic, simple food. As good as I've had just about anywhere. Yum.","On a rare blue sky day in Edinburgh we found ourselves chilled from the motorcycle ride and in need of some heat - so Tex Mex seemed like a good idea.  As the flaming fajitas were lit and placed in front of me, I knew that we had made the right choice.  There was a medley of colours and textures in the vegetarian fajitas and once the butternut squash, peppers, onions and melons were wrapped in the tortilla along with some sour cream, jalapenos, cheese and / or guacamole the resultant taste explosion was delightful.  I enjoyed every mouthful of my meal. \n\nIan had the carnitas (shredded pork) and, although I found it too salty, he enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nWe were given the hot sauce as a condiment and immediately asked for the hotter one as neither of us felt that there was any heat in it.  The next level up wasn't available so we ended up with the kitchen's chilli paste - which had a lovely kick and great flavour.\n\nOur only disappointments were that the key lime pie had run out the night before and that we couldn't drink the margaritas as we were riding home.  We'll be back!","i have to apologise as this update is rather overdue!  i was in tex mex about three weeks ago after my boyfriend and i were turned away at two sushi restaurants because they were too full and couldn't seat us until some ungodly time by which point i think my stomach would have eaten itself.  i was starving!!!! and getting grumpy and wanted delicious food and drink on a friday night... but it seemed like the world was against me and then we went to Tex Mex 2 and all was well.\n\nwe walked in and the waiter recognised us (since we go at least once a month) and gave us a table right away.  while we were looking at the menu the couple in the corner table by the window left and we were offered that table since we were regulars and the table we were at was a bit crammed.  so bonus points for giving your regulars a bit extra :) \n\nthe food was delicious as always as were the margaritas!!  but it was really the customer service that night that pushed this review up to five stars.  we were given a table straight away and then moved to a better one.  we were noted as regular customers and given a refill on the popcorn that you get while reading the menu.  our food was delivered promptly but with enough time to enjoy the meal and not feel rushed.  also when they brought us the bill they us gave us a voucher for a free margarita.  so yay for tex mex 2!  my beacon of light while other restaurants have the gall to turn us away.  you've earned your five stars!!","A really good Mexican restuarant I found late-night in Edinburgh, when places all around seemed to be closing  and I was hankering after some spice action.\n\nWe went for tacos and burritos, with a side of chili in a fried tortilla. This is some of the freshest Mexican food I've ever had, the flavour was bursting out with lime, lemon and chilli, just how it should be.\n\nPortions are really big too, in fact so large I had to ask for a doggy bag. This was a shameful event as I just wanted to eat it all fresh, it tasted so good.\n\nIf you love Mexican food get over here. Prices are reasonable too.","Tex Mex 2 is a real gem, hands down! The atmosphere is awesome, food and daiquiries are awesome and staff is soooo friendly. Don't miss this restaurant during your stay in Edinburgh!","Oh I love this place. it's staple in my thought patterns when trying to think of somewhere to go and eat in town....\n\nThe Margarita's, I confess, do quite heavily draw me to this place...they're so yum it's unreal...probably the best in town.\n\nThe food has always been consistently good in here and I, nor anyone I've dragged here (if they like Tex Mex or not) have had cause for complaint. \n\nThe staff I always find are friendly. I was in here a couple of days ago and the chap noticed that I was waiting for a friend so brought me over some water and a magazine whilst I was waiting...like I say, nice staff!\n\nOh and you get Jelly babies instead of mints with your bill....enough said ;)","Margarita time!!! Love them. Particularly rate the strawberry. And when they attempted to scrimp on the salt and only cover half the rim on my glass, boy were they told! Salt me now!! For the margaritas alone I would keep coming back here. \n\nShame it's not bigger, with a bar area too, but I guess it would lose a bit of its charm. The guy serving us was really friendly and took our girly banter in good spirit. He even topped up our spiced popcorn bowl for which was delish. \n\nOne thing I will say. A total school boy error ordering starters and mains each. The portions are huge and Mexican is man-food so very filling and stodgy. My chicken chimichanga was very tasty. Homemade guacamole and salsa. Tick. Too many onions in the salsa in my opinion though. The beef burrito was equally tasty but huuuuuuge! Could only eat half. Totally hit the spot though and lined my pre Oktoberfest stomach nicely ;)\n\nI love this wee place and find it hard to find better Mexican food in Edinburgh.","I really liked Tex Mex 2. I'd been wanting to go for awhile but didn't quite make it but with a girls night squeezed in before Christmas, we fancied margarita's and headed here.\n\nI liked my margarita and the 1/2 litre jug is around £7.50 for the original type and about £1 more for flavoured (mango, strawberry, peach). The menu is pretty good - all the usual suspects such as chips and dips, chilli con carne, tacos, tortillas, flautas, burritos and more. \n\nI was tempted by the soft shell crab flautas and they were really good. Corn tortilla, fried, with a generous portion of crab, with guac, sour cream and salsa on top and salad on the side. They were good and I'd probably eat two lots of these and be happy!\n\nI went for carnitas as a main - more like a tender pork stew with gravy rather than anything spicy but still tasty and would make for a good comfort food choice. I got corn tortillas with it as I'm GF and it was good. This dish probably didn't wow me, but I also probably should have ordered just two starters instead of a starter and main as I was pretty full as I worked my way through those chunky pork carnitas.\n\nStaff were friendly and helpful - drinks and food came quickly and I loved the very moreish popcorn that was on the table as I arrived - yum. For two courses, 1/2 litre of margarita and a coke I was £27. \nI was totally stuffed and all tex mex'd out. Well worth a visit but it is small so it would be worth booking as there were more than a few disappointed peeps turned away...\n\nNote - they do cater for gluten free peeps - most stuff can be amended and they have corn tortillas and tacos - there were only a couple of things on the menu which were totally off limits so this was great too, rather than half your choices disappearing after the question of  'what can be made gluten free?'","Good atmosphere? Check.  Great food? Check.  Reasonable prices? Check.  All things you will find at Tex-Mex II on Thistle Street.\nLast night was the second time I've been there and since it was so good the first time I thought I would like to go back for my birthday dinner.  We went with the full intention of getting a pitcher of margaritas, a main course and one of their delicious sounding desserts (their menu is on their website).\nI love the quaintness of this place, there are about 9 tables in total with a colourful decor, making for a nice intimate dinner.  We ordered our pitcher of margaritas while we poured over the menu of delicious selections, trying desperately to decide what to order.  \nWhile the nacho starter was VERY tempting, I knew I wanted to save room for dessert so we both decided we were content with our litre pitcher of frozen margarita (you can get non-frozen ones if that is more to your taste although I'm not sure they do a pitcher of them or not!).  They also serve some amazing spiced popcorn as a wee starter to each table with a food/drink order.\nI decided to get the Enchillada de la Casa while my partner got the Gaucho Grande.  We were not disappointed.  The Enchillada de la Casa is two tortillas filled with a choice of chicken, shredded beef, chilli beef or vegetarian with a \"ranchero\" sauce and cheese. The ranchero sauce was tomato based, with cilantro, green onion, lime juice and chunks of yellow pepper.  I went with the chicken filling, which was beautifully spiced. It was so tasty! I also wasn't expecting the lovely side salad/rice combo that you get with the dish.\nThe Gaucho Grande was equally impressive and equally tasty. You get a generous helping of the Chile Colorado in a tortilla bowl as well as a pork burrito.  It also came with salad, sour cream, guacamole and all the fixin's. I tried some and based on my partner's reaction as well, it was amazing.\nThere are very very few occasions where I can't manage dessert. This was one of those times. I love dessert but the mains were so delicious and so filling that we had to call it a night.  It simply means I have to go back and maybe just have the Nachos Grande and dessert for my meal!!  \nFor all this food and drink our bill was £33.50.  You just can't beat that for very quality food and a pitcher of margarita that the two of us got the better part of three glasses each out of.  I highly recommend this place but make a reservation!!!"],"business_id":"7Ti_yD4wODH2i1lV30Sg_g","name":"Tex Mex 2","categories":["Mexican","Tex-Mex","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["My fiancé and I stopped in for a quick dinner on a Tuesday night... The place was pretty empty. We sat at the bar, since it was the only place you get happy hour, service was attentive and quick. Since the appetizers were discounted for HH, we got 2. The corn and the \"pico de avocado\" were both fine, but pretty small portions. The menu is pretty simple and the decor is nice. We were both really disappointed in our food.... First I was sent out the wrong item. I ordered the chile rojo chicken dish, what I got was the relleno. I def snuck a bite, before sending it back. When I got my dish i was disappointed in the presentation, the chicken looked slopped on the plate, like cafeteria food. I thought the over all flavor was really boring and certainly not worth the $14 price tag. I just ate my tortilla and gave up. My fiancé's dish literally looked like dog food. He said it tasted similar. I did not try it. We both thought the rice and borracho beans we not worth eating. The salsa they brought us at the brining was watery... More like taco sauce. \n\nOn a good note... The tortillas and margaritas were good! Doubtful that we would ever return.","Nice atmosphere. The servers were all very nice. We both had the carne asada which was excellent. Home made tortillas are amazing. They could use to expand their bar menu a little,  but did have my favorite beer in cans. Would go again.","Yum. Lovely decor. Cute patio for a nice day. Great Mexican beer selection. I was just reading that this restaurant is affiliated with Ponchos in central Phoenix. It doesn't get more authentic than that. Much fancier here, tho. The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. Came for lunch. Great tortas -I'd recommend getting beans over fries but both are good. Burritos delicious too. Mexican corn was amazing. No complaints!","5 stars on iced tea\n4 stars on bean dip and beans\n4 stars on the salsas both are pretty good\n3 stars on chips, they are cold\n2 stars on taco , pretty basic and $8\n2 stars on tamale , ok taste but only a very small amount of meat and a lot of masa \nDidn't like the rice but I'm not much of a rice person anyway so idk how to rate it\n\nAmbiance is nice , service is okay , prices are high","This is a cute little place to grab a bite to eat. I didn't think my veggie burrito was anything to write home about but it was alright. I felt things were a little pricey but I might be willing to go back and give it another based on others rave reviews.","Giving three stars because my girlfriend liked her Torta. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and found the chicken to be very dry (as if any juice was squeezed from the shredded chicken) and the sauce to be very bland. Enjoyable atmosphere, and decent service.  Just not sure I'll be back.","I was a little underwhelmed by this place. I went on a recommendation from a blogger I normally trust. I had the carne asada and it was tough and not very flavorful. The saving grace was the refried beans and the tortilla was probably the best tortilla I have ever had. I would go back but would likely only order a big bowl of refried beans and some tortillas.","Excellent!  We tried this for lunch and it was very good.  Food was fresh and the fajitas were delicious.  Service was very good as well.","First time for dinner last Saturday night. Not crowded with lots of staff. I had one of their combo dinners. Enchilada with beans and rice. It was good, price a little high compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area. Limited draft beer choices. The decor was nice and the staff was friendly. I'll try it again. I was struck by the number of employees vs customers. Good location, nice outdoor seating.","Came across Isabel's randomly and was pleasantly surprised. I have celiac and this place is very GFREE friendly. Great atmosphere and food. I will be back.","My wife has been following them on Facebook months before they even opened, but we hadn't had a chance to go visit until this past Friday night (12/20/13).  It was well worth it. \n\nIt's a smaller restaurant with comfortable indoor seating and outdoor patio seating along with bar seating. The staff was friendly and apologetic about the 20 min wait time for a table due to two large business Christmas parties taking place at that time. However, once seated, we were well-taken care of. Our waiter was efficient, yet unobtrusive. Bus staff was busy, but you never seemed to notice they were there. \n\nChips and salsa came out, delicious. I had the Dia De Los Muertos Pale Ale, my wife had a mojito. The wine list does not feature any wines from France, but it does feature three from Southern AZ - very nice touch! The menu is not overly large - they obviously know what they can make and do it well. I ordered the Poblano Chile Relleno, my wife ordered the Chili Rojo de Pollo.  Very much a gluten-free menu - most everything can be made GF or already is.\n\nOnce the food arrived, it was hot, steamy, and delicious. The Chili Rojo de Pollo was so good, it reminded us of the food we had at our wedding... 17 years ago! \n\nThe price was excellent for the quality of food and service we received. Isabel's Amor has definitely found its niche as an upscale Mexican restaurant. \n\nWe have a favorite Mexican restaurant in Tucson; I think this has become our new favorite here in the Valley. We will definitely be returning.","My husband and I didn't have high hopes for the food based on the reviews, but we decided to try this place out anyways because we were hoping for some awesome cocktails close to our house. We would have been much better off driving a little further to Joyride instead.\n\nWe should have known things would be bad when we arrived to an almost empty dining room 8pm on a Saturday night. It was just us and a guy sitting at the bar. Three staff members sat at a nearby table chatting it up while they were doing some prep work.\n\nOur waitress was sweet and earnest, and she definitely kept this from being a one star review. My paloma cocktail was completely unremarkable, but my husband thought his whiskey cocktail was decent. The food was totally disappointing though. The street corn tasted like it came straight from the can or freezer which likely explains all the accumulated fluid at the bottom of the dish. The jicama and watermelon salad was pretty flavorless. At least it came out quickly. My cucumber and avocado torta didn't have any cucumber and just a few pieces of under-ripe avocado. It also had some tomato, onion and mayo but that was it! I can't believe they didn't put any queso fresco or jalapeno on the torta. Needless to say, I've had much better tortas for half the price ($9). My husband got the $16 steak entree which he thought was way too citrusy. The beans and rice on the side weren't even as good as what we  make at home.\n\nI would be surprised if this place stayed in business much longer. The idea behind the restaurant is good, but the execution is lacking.","Great place for couples. We had the carne asada which was great, my wife had the fajitas which were perfect as well. We finished the night with the strawberry cheesecake in a jar. It was wonderful as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.","Quaint, charming and yummy food! \n\nWas there for dinner and our party of 4 stayed till their closing time. The food was yummy and I enjoyed the experience. Again can't recall the names of the dish but the appetizers and entree were both very good! I recall having no room for dessert, so could not try the flan. \n\nThis is not a huge chain type of restaurant and you can feel the difference here - in a good way! Service was good despite our server having more tables than usual to wait on. And the food tasted fresh - which is awesome when it comes to Mexican food and you can taste the flavors!\n\nI will be back!","This placed is great my husband and I went last night for our first time. Love the atmosphere and employees are on top of everything.  Food came out pretty quick. \n\nWe started with the jicama and watermelon appetizer which I loved. The flavors were great only thing is its $6 for a small amount of fruit/appetizer even though most appetizers are small for $6 bucks its over priced but its worth trying.\n\nI got a chicken & beef enchiladas- chicken was ok, beef was amazing their tortillas are delicious im not sure if there homemade but they sure taste like it. Out of the 3 choices of beans I was satisfied with my choice I tried my husband and his were grest as well. Rice as not good its like every mexican restaurant its flavor less and on the plate to take up room.\n\nMy husband got the carne asada - He enjoyed it but we thought for $16 he'd be full or at least get more meat out of it. I buy 1 pound for $6 at the store and thats a deal :) \n\nOverall... less rice and beans more entrée\nDefinitely a must try!\nWe'll be going back most definitely! !","My wife and were excited to come upon this new place when pulling into grab a bite at Blue 32.  Always looking for killer upscale Mexican near our house.  \nWe have eaten here twice in the past couple of weeks.  \n\nFirst the good stuff.  The red salsa they serve first off with the chips is outstanding.  Also the beans (all of them) are off the charts good.  Tortillas are killer as well. The staff is on top of things.  Not sure how they would do if it got busy however.  \n\nI love the space and the decor is ok....I would have done the place more rustic adding more wood, iron, and candles.  That seems to be what they are going for with the upscale Mexican menu.  They keep it way to bright in the evenings.  \n\nNow for the not good.  \nThe entrees are just not good.  We've tried 4 different entrees in our two visits and found none of them all that great.  The pork carnitas were some of the driest I've ever had.  \nThey have they're entrees priced way too high for the quality of food coming out of the kitchen.  \nAlso the drinks are priced too high as well. $7 for a 12oz bottle of beer... $5 for a draft beer...$9 for special drinks. I don't see folks in Gilbert paying these prices.  \n\nI really hope this place makes it, but it seems to be nearly empty most times when we go there or drive by.  \n\nWe will go back, but only for happy hour.  Bring on that salsa.  \n\nHopefully the owner reads this review:\n\n1. Bring the entree food quality up to what it should be.\n2. Lower the prices on the menu $2 on most near everything starting with the bar. \n3. Tweak the decor and lighting for better ambiance.","Very quaint new little place with good ambiance.  Quiet decor and a nice bar seating area. Our waiter was very friendly and prompt.  We started with a unique flavored margarita, Blackberry Sage.  It was delicious!  Their house frozen margarita was delicious as well, included organic agave. Both were served in mason jars.  \n\nAll our food was nicely prepared and rice had a nice flavor.  The only complaint was that the carnitas were pretty dry.  We explained that to the manager and she welcomed the feedback.  \n\nOnto the desserts which were REALLY creative and tasty.  I would recommend the Margarita Lime Cheesecake served in a baby mason jar. If you order to go, they send you home with the cute labeled dessert jars.\n\nHopefully they can make a few tweaks to the food and this place has a lot of potential! Love the location !  We will def be back.","Isabel's Amor is the first restaurant I visited in Phoenix while I was on my recent vacation.  Being closer to the border, I was wondering what an improvement on their Mexican food over Utah's would bring.  The selections were definitely different, however, I wouldn't label this \"authentic\" Mexican - more of a Texmex, or what I refer to as \"clean\" Mexican.  This is an alright thing, actually.  The food was not greasy at all, the selection of four different kinds of salsa made my tastebuds happy (although still not as delicious as Cantina's in Sandy, UT), and everything was delicious.  \nI had the Mexican street corn and, although not what I thought it was, it was delicious!  My friends enjoyed their burritos...I think all of them had lunch burritos.  I'm not a bean girl, so I steered cleared of those (and my friends later that day - zing!).  \nOur waiter was great - he picked up on the sarcastic nature of one of our girls early on and matched her pacing, which lead to a lot of laughs from the group.  Well played, sir!  We sat outside and he turned the heaters on for us when our table became shaded from the sun.  he kept our drinks full and area clean.\nThanks, Isabel's for a great experience in Phoenix.","Took the family from Tucson, and we are all very picky when it comes to Mexican food. It's hard when you're Mexican and come from a family of Mexican restaurant owners. \n\nRed sauce=no bueno \n\nCarne asada= bomb \n\nSalsa= good\n\nBeans= good\n\nRice=ok\n\nTortillas=bomb \n\nCarnitas= eh...kinda dry\n\nAll in all, we will return. Staff was super friendly and on their game!","Meh.\nCute place. Small and clean. Bathrooms  are super nice.\n\n The salsa they give with the chips is really yummy. The house margarita served in a mason jar was yummy. The Borracho beans are AMAZEBALLS.\n\nI had the steak fajitas. Here's my issue. They give you one tortilla and a plateful of meat. I had to ask for a second tortilla. It should automatically come with AT LEAST 2. Everywhere else I've had fajitas, they give 2 torts.\nThe meat was quite gristly and came out in whole pieces when you bit into it. So maybe invest in a better cut of meat?\nHubby had the Pescado De La Parrilla, which is the fish. It was delicious. I wish I had ordered that, instead.\n\nIt was a quick meal for us on or way home. I may try it again, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. Next time I plan on getting all the appetizers to try.\nYou MUST get the borracho beans. THEY ARE BOMB!","I'm always excited for locally-owned restaurants and was really enthusiastic until the food came.  I'm really only giving them 2 stars, because the service was fine, the patio was nice, and the salsa was good.  However, the food was both bland and barely warm.  I read on their website that the owners are part of the Someburros family, so I thought it would be good.  I was willing to pay twice the price for good Mexican in a higher end atmosphere.  My husband joked that the person who recommended Isabels owed us $40 and an apology. Lol!","First visit with 2 other adult couples. All meals were nicely prepared. Nothing over the top fantastic but for a new place, very pleased. Service was ok and should improve over time. Try the Mexicali Mule. Liked that the served AZ based wines as well. Look forward to coming again.","We had an amazing experience at this quaint restaurant.  It was a beautiful day to sit on their patio.  We had great margaritas in mason jars and great wine too!  The chips and dip were wonderful.  The salsa is a bit spicy, but we loved it!  Food was well above average for a Mexican joint.  Atmosphere is the best part of the place.  We would go back in a heartbeat!","My wife and I decided to try this place one night since it's close by and wanted good mexican food. Love the area and the setting. Nice patio section. Service was great.\nMy wife is a big nachos fan so that's what she ordered. It had great flavor, but she just didn't like the presentation. She likes a pile of messy nachos and these are served with perfectly layered and topped chips. I had a corn tamale and a chicken tamale with black beans and rice. I thought they were outstanding. Good flavor, just not an extraordinary amount of meat, but it was fine with me. Tasted great. The black beans were excellent also. Rice was rice, nothing special.\nPrices are on the up side for what you get, but I sometimes don't mind paying it if it's good food, as this was. I had one draft beer, which was $6 I believe, since I was not sitting at the bar to get happy hour prices. Definitely don't like that idea. Why do I HAVE to sit at the bar to get happy hour prices? Why have a nice setting in the cafe and nice patio if you're not going to give me happy hour prices while I'm there?","Great looking place. Neat location. Food was basic fare.  Chips and salsa were really good. Margaritas were not strong at all. Tried a variety of foods. Chile verde was bland at a comfort food level. Carnitas were nice and greasy as they should be. Tacos, well, were tacos. Be cool if the flavors popped a bit more. Good stand by place.","New restaurant that I'm happy to have tried. It has a pretty cool modern setup and is very clean!! The menu is great with lots of items to choose from and the food is VERY fresh! I will definitely be a regular!","Not your typical American Mexican Food, a little more gourmet.  Good food and drink, friendly service, clean place with a nice patio.","Been looking for solid Mexican food since moving from CA two years ago. This place is amazing. Homemade tortillas, high quality and great flavors. Can't recommend enough, will be back for sure.","What a find! My daughter and I were out looking for a cafe type place to have dinner. I saw this place remembering that I've been wanting to try it. Lovely atmosphere, wonderful service and delicious food! We like to share meals so we ordered Baja Shrimp Coctel, Tamales, and Churros with coffee. Everything was so good! And to make the food and atmosphere even better they have live music on Thursday nights! What a treat, the musician is funny, talented and interacts with customers. You can even make requests. I look forward to another Thursday night dinner here.","First visit to Isabel's Amor was great.  I went with a group of friends and we had the best time--great server, environment was unbeatable (cute patio with lights), live guitarist (who was awesome) and the food was perfect-to-order.  I had the carne asada burrito and it was delicious, soft tortillas, and the meat melted in my mouth.  My husband had the tamale platter (I sneaked a bite) and it was so good I wish I had ordered that instead. The service was great, and it was a little bit busy, so our server had a hard time reaching our large party.  But, I loved having a quaint diner like Isabel's in Gilbert. I highly recommend it.","We know Poncho's and the chain Someburros and heard the family was opening a new spot so we had to try it.  The restaurant is located at Williams Field and Val Vista on the Northwest corner.  It is set back a bit from the road.  \n\nWe were greeted promptly by a pleasant hostess upon entering.  We asked to sit out side and she seated us at a table with a bench cushion on one side and a regular chair at the other side.  After sitting for a minute or two we moved to a different table in the sun.  We received our chips and salsa very quickly as well as water.  The waiter and bus person both seemed very eager to please.  The chips and sauce were good -- not salsa but a red sauce.  I had a house margarita which is served in a mason jar.  Very good -- 7$  \n\nThe regular menu has a lot of what I would call non-traditional mexican dishes as well as some items like burros and tacos which are more familiar.  The lunch menu has 5 items priced at either 8$ or 10$.  My friend had the green burro with beans and rice off the lunch menu 10$ and I had the Carnitas Torta off the regular menu -- 9$  The waiter made a point of telling me \"the dishes are all traditional Mexican food -- there is no americanization of the food.\"  I asked if the torta came with beans and he said no, it comes with thick fries.  So, immediately contradicting himself -- no traditional Mexican food I have ever eaten comes with French Fries.  Anyway, I digress..  The torta was really a sandwich, carnitas (a little dry and too chewy) lettuce, tomato, avocado, onions and some mayo sauce.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing, it was just OK.  My friend had the green chili burro and we both tried it and it was delicious albeit a bit on the small side for 10$.  The beans were excellent.  \n\nThe decor is tasteful with lots of neat touches everywhere.  The restaurant is not overly large but has a nice patio which probably seats 34-40 people.  They were not busy today -- only 2 other tables while we were there.  The staff outnumbered the customers 3 to 1.   \n\nWe both found the service a bit on the suffocating side.  Checking back constantly, talking too long at the table, etc.  We both prefer simple efficient service, bring a wonderful product and then let us enjoy it.    \n\nI really hope this place is a great success, it has all the right ingredients -- I think a few kinks have to be worked out and perhaps the menu needs to be a little more mainstream and lower priced.  Most of the entries on the regular menu were between 13-16$ which is a lot for Mexican food.  \n\nWould we come back?  Maybe, if we were in the area.  Would I drive from NE Mesa to eat at Isabel's?  Not likely.","The atmosphere and drinks are good.  Other than that, if you want to eat Someburros and spend more money doing it than this is the place for you.  Half of your plate is rice and beans and the actual entree is mediocre at best.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend going here for dinner.  If you want a nice atmosphere to enjoy some drinks and appetizers than this is a better option.","We were excited to see a new upscale Mexican restaurant open in the neighborhood and especially excited after we read the first reviews.   When you step in Isabel's you can see the owners put a lot of effort into the decor.  Utilitarian- but beautiful.  We were greeted by a warm staff that quickly seated us next to the rolling glass garage door.  \nOnce we read the menu, we started to think we may just be lucky enough to have a Barrio Cafe equivalent just a couple blocks away.  I ordered the chicken tomatillo tamales and my wife ordered the chile relleno.  Unfortunately, Isabel's can't hold a candle to some of the finest Mexican food Phoenix has to offer.  \nOne of my tamales was almost entirely corn meal.  The other was flavorful, but the chicken was dry.  My wife's Relleno was tasty, but the chiles had been charred leaving behind the withered and tasteless tops that could not be seen until you bit into them.  Not good.  Now, the drinks are another story- WOW!  Unbelievably tasty, but you do pay $10 for the best of what Isabel's has to offer in the alcohol department.\nOverall, the experience was not bad, but it wasn't great either.  For the prices, I can say we expected a lot more.  Perhaps as they work out the kinks Isabel's will bring a lot more amor to my taste buds.","Enjoyed a wonderful meal at Isabel's today. The facility is very nice and modern with a beautiful patio.\n\nThe food is fresh, local, and delicious (the tortillas are made fresh - man are they good!). If you still have room after the main course, the desert menu features some amazing treats.\n\nAt the end of the meal you get chiclet gum - a nice touch.\n\nPrices seemed a little above average, but worth it if you are looking for something classy.","I was excited for my first trip to Isabel's Amor.  The new restaurant looked sharp.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful Arizona day.  I was with friends and we all had one of their unique cocktails.  The drinks were classics with nice little twists to make them special.  We enjoyed them.  The food was very good.  I had the Carnitas.  I was impressed with the quality and preparation. I should mention the chips and salsa are addicting!  Perfect spot to meet friends for drinks/apps or take the family for dinner.  Go to this restaurant, you will enjoy your experience.","Best carne asada tortas. Only $9 and you get a huge sandwich with a large portion of fries. Make sure to dip it in their jalapeño ranch.","My wife and I went to Isabel's Amor last night, just because we were in the area and decided to try someplace new. We were rewarded with one of the best meals we have had out in a long time. The restaurant was very warm and inviting, and the staff friendly and welcoming. The service was attentive and pleasant. \n\nWe ordered the House Made Pico De Avacado, which was a delicious citrus flavored avocado dip. I had the Chile Verde, and loved every bite. The meat was tender and flavorful. The rice is very good and the refried beans were some of the best I have ever had. My wife had the Poblano Chile Relleno, which was delicious. \n\nThe price was very good for the quality we received. We will be returning to try other menu items, no question. I would highly recommend this restaurant."],"business_id":"7Wolt8zNBweU_I-Gx7mwzQ","name":"Isabel's Amor","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["So-so. This is a Cafe Rio or Costa Vida knockoff. The food is ok but is way over priced for the portion size.","Ok...  Fair statement here: I LOVE Bajio but my wife hates it.  The food is great, the price is right and the service - ohhh the service can not be beat!  I'll continue to sneak off and eat here when the wife isn't looking.","My wife and I just moved into the area and we felt like eating Mexican food. We came across Bajios and decided to try it out. It was definitely comparable to Chipotle while still being different and it was very good. I would actually even say that they have more to chose from than Chipotle. Will definitely be going back soon!","The food is good enough.  A couple things are a little more creative than Chipotle would offer.  The beans and rice are nothing to write home about and unfortunately, they give you a lot of that..  The fruit-based salsas are nice.  There is a the sweet green chili sauce they do that is nice, but probably high in sugar for an entree.  If you get a drink, you might easily drop $10.  You can get better food for that at a sit-down Mexican place..","Fish tacos were awesome. The refried beans were bland and kinda gross. The rice was decent. I'll come back again but I won't order beans.","On a lazy Sunday, needed to get a quick bite for lunch and wanted to try something different.  Figured we'd give this place a try as my wife loves hispanic food.  I ran over for take out.  First the place is actually huge inside which is surprising and they have a couple of flat panel TVs in the dining area.  I grabbed a couple of their burritos, one with pork and the other with chicken.  They make everything in front of you and have quite a few options to put in the burrito.  I had the \"spicy beans\" in my burrito and they were anything but spicy.  The salsa provided also was bland.  Overall the food was OK, but nothing that is going to make me want to go back anytime soon.","Best shrimp tacos anywhere! The atmosphere is great, the place is nice and big and kid friendly.","Dropped by this place cause I needed a quick bite and it was new to me.  Well needless to say I ate and left.  I don't even remember what I ate, but it was food for sure -- I think!? Okay gotta stop being mean.  Let's just say it wasn't anything \"new\".  Nothing I couldn't have ordered say from Rubio's or Chipotle.  Yo quero Taco Bells please :(  The place itself was decorated with some traditional Mexican portraits and paintings in an industrial-like setting.  Kinda odd, but whatever tickles your senses I guess. - Enjoy!","Mucho food for un pequeno price. I had the fajitas, the daily special, for only $7.99.  That's cheaper than even Chili's and oh so much better. The chicken was flavorful, the toppings were fresh, and you had two choices for rice (sweet or Spanish) and beans (refried or black). \n\nIt's cafeteria-style ordering, so you tell them what you want and watch them prepare it right in front of you. Customer service seemed very friendly -- I was greeted with a smiling \"Hola!\"\n\nMy biggest issue, or rather annoyance on my part, was this alert-the-restaurant banging of copper kettles that punctuated my whole dinner.  I can't figure out what it was all about.  I think if you got some punch-card from them, they hit a kettle and shouted out something. It was kind of stupid. I didn't like it. Especially when I was in the middle of a sentence that I had to repeat because of it.\n\nBut, heck, what am I saying. I'll go back. Copper-kettle banging or not, the food was good and a great price.","This used to be a favorite of mine, but recently when I eat there I do not feel well afterward. The quality of the food is no longer where it once was.  I will not eat here again,","There really isn't much I liked about this place.  I had a chicken burrito, and was just unimpressed.  The tortilla was average, and everything was just kind of soggy.  The chicken was in sort of a broth, rather than what you'd see at places like Chipotle or Baja Fresh, where it's grilled and diced.  This was more like pulled chicken, though it was larger pieces.\n\nGot a side of the queso sauce too, which looked good, and it was fine, though a little thin.  Try a place like Panchero's for awesome queso.  Had a side of chips and salsa, but again, below average.  \n\nI probably won't come back here, there are too many better options.  Even the Coke wasn't great - the ice is crushed, so it melts quickly, watering down your drink.\n\nStaff was friendly and accommodating, though.  And the place looks good, so it doesn't get just one star.  Service is slow, because they don't seem to have the \"assembly line\" thing down like at other places (hi, Chipotle).","My boyfriend and I were in the area, wanted to try something new, scoped it out on YELP. Thought it would be good because the reviews were good. Only one menu off to the side in the whole place. One girl was working, no greeting, went up and asked her about a menu item and could have cared less. She didn't ask if it was our first time or try to help in any way, was tossing things around, must have hated her job. Could barely hear her when asking the type of bean or rice we wanted. Absolutely would not come here again. The impression from just the employee not having any sort of customer service skills was enough for me to not want to come back. The food was decent, had a salad and nothing to write home about. You can just go to Chipotle and get the customer service and good food.","Good, not great.  The quality of the food was subpar and the quantity didn't make up for any of what was lost. Workers weren't very friendly and it was pricier than chipotle, without being better.","Tasty tortilla, fresh veggies, yummy meat, rice and beans. Great service and we come here all the time.","Had a salad here this week that I am craving again already!  Th egreen chili chicken salad is really tasty. It has a little sweetness and a mild chili flavor. As if that was not tasty enough, the fresh hot tortilla served with the salad was the perfect accompaniment.","I've been eating here now for over 4 years from highschool until now my sophomore year in college, and I have to say they are on their way out because at one point their food was to be reckoned with and now it's just bleh. Last time I was there I was really disappointed by the service. One lady working and I seemed to bother her to give her business.","I was introduced to Bajio by a co-worker who lives nearby and visits so often that most of the employees know her. She loves the Chicken Green Chile Salad which I tried once and was good. But I love the Pineapple Shrimp Salad which is what I usually get because of the delicious mix of flavors and textures. The salad has both rice and lettuce and comes with crispy flour tortillas. The Shrimp Tacos are also good. They saute the shrimp right when you order it so it takes a bit longer but is nice and fresh. I didn't like the Enchiladas which are not what I consider a true Enchilada. It's like ordering a Quesadilla at Chipotle.\n\nFrom what I can tell, they bang the kettle when someone leaves a tip. This annoys me too, but like Tracy I keep going back because the food's good.","This is a family owned Chipotle like kind of place adorned with  Whimsical Disneyish  boarder line offensive Stereotype Mexican Caricature Paintings. Your food is served to you in aluminum cake pans. (that might be a sign to run away) and they ring a cow bell when you tip them. (maybe another sign of I got another sucker today and this one going to die when they try this food)  I've been here before and thought I remembered it being better and maybe I was just here on a off day on my most recent visit. My expectations weren't high I knew where I was I was just expecting quick and OK.\n\nI am giving two stars based on my husband's meal of two enchiladas that he said wasn't the best but edible and cheap.\n\nI liked the fresh greens in my salad and I really liked the fresh cabbage option for the salad but I didn't like my Chicken Green Chile Salad for many reasons. So I have to think do I just don't like it because of my taste or is this a meal that IS awful? My conclusion is that it was awful.\n\n1) The Chicken tasted like CANDIED Chicken. It's a shame because the chicken seemed fresh and was cooked nice and seemed like it could have been good in other hands. (even a caveman can do better)  I didn't know you could make chicken that sweet. They took the time to marinate the chicken with honey and poured a ton of honey on top of it.\n\n2) The what seemed like house made dressing was awful and I don't know what it was suppose to be. It could be used as a WD40 substitute. I took a small taste and pushed it away before it caused damage in my system.\n\n3) The pasteurized guacamole like green stuff just doesn't taste good. It's manufactured mix of chemicals that Lowe's maybe uses in their paint.\n\n4) The salsa tasted like those budget jarred salsa that always suck. Nothing fresh and not so good tasting. Very flat and soggy.\n\n5) They gave me a fresh made flour tortilla that was RAW!\n\n6) Where was the Green Chile? Nothing resembled green chile in my salad but I did have fried onions and I did have fresh greens in a tin! WOO HOO!\n\nADIOS Bajio!\n\n1.5 Stars","I think this place has pretty good food for a pretty reasonable price.  The strip mall it's in is relatively easy to get in and out of, so I sometimes go here instead of the Chipotle across the street when I'm in the mood.","Very good selection of burritos, tacos and more.  They have great quality ingredients, have never had a problem.  Prices are reasonable, and staff is very friendly.  Tables are kept clean and so is the rest of the place.  The only thing that's missing is they no longer serve beer.","Stopped by Bajio's for lunch today for the sake of trying something new.  I had the chicken stuffed quesadilla which just happened to be the daily special at $6.99.  A coworker had a sweet green chili quesadilla which sounded strange but tasted very good as well! The portions were plentiful so you will not leave hungry.  I will definitely returning to try out some more menu items.\n\nAnd yes.......the random bell ringing/pot clanging was a little obnoxious...","Ate lunch here today while visiting my cousin Marc.  His wife Lori is a huge fan of this place.  She kept saying \"fresh\" over & over again.  She was right.  It's a big room in a huge outdoor/strip mall kind of place.  You order off a menu that is painted on the wall, then you step up to a Subway Sandwich type counter where they prepare your food in front of you.  You order shrimp tacos, they throw the shrimp on the open stove right there.  Then they take your plate down the counter of \"fresh\" ingredients and ask you want you want.  \nWhat kind of rice do you want?\nWhat kind of beans?\nWhich salsa?\nWhich reminds me: they have mango salsa!  Are you kidding me?  It was yummy. Did I mention they serve mexican beers?  They have margaritas too.  But they're pre-made and come out of a tap.  Which is the reason I'm not giving Bajio 5 stars\nThe place was seriously busy at lunch, but they have many tables.","We have been to Bajio dozens of times since it opened a few years back.  I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in a meal.  There have been a lot of changes over the past couple of years, with the recent change to being a 'cantina' with flat screen tv's, alcoholic drinks, etc.  The ordering is very simple, it's an assembly line (a la Chipotle).  If you want (or don't want) something, all you have to do is tell them.\n\nThe three of us went for a weekend lunch, and the place had a pretty good crowd.  The line still moved pretty fast.  I got a chicken quesadilla with rice and beans, rather than my regular nachos.  The quesadilla was good, though I'll probably get the nachos next time.  The rice and beans were also good.  The one problem with the meal (and all of us thought this) was that the sodas seemed to be on the flat side.  At first I thought it was a problem with my drink, but when I mentioned it later, everyone else had the same problem.  \n\nThis visit, Bajio earned a solid 4 stars, marking them down for the odd tasting drinks.  On an overall/portfolio, I'd give them 4.5 stars.  (Note:  I did have an issue with them a couple weeks back when somehow I got subscribed to their text club.  I mean, five texts in 10 minutes is a little ridiculous, even if I had knowingly signed up.  Luckily, I talked to a manager, Jan, who was extremely helpful and took care of the problem).  I will definitely be back to Bajio.","I'm a fan of these types of Mexican restaurants. It's the line up and order what you want and they scoop all your ingredients onto your burrito right in front of you steez.\n\nIt's the Chipotle/Qdoba/Kokopelli/Cafe Rio style place.\n\nWhat sets Bajio apart from these other spots? I think their restaurant is a bit nicer & they have some additional options that you might not find at the other guys.\n\n3 types of beans: refried, black & spicy\n2 types of rice: Mexican style & sweet\nTONS of types of sauces\n\nIf you're a fan of this type of Mexican & you want lots of choices, give Bajio a try.","Oh my! How have I NOT reviewed this place yet?! It is amazing. This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx. (the other one is Bamboo Grill) If the man is there, he is the best. Always happy to see you, and ready to chat while he cooks! I have gone in here with my mom and sister, with just me and Hubs, and with my 2 little ones. Every time the food is fantastic. If it's just the girls working, the service pales in comparison to when the guy is there.. but the food makes up for that! Try the tortilla soup! Made right there in front of you and ohhhh... sooo good! Hubby and I always share the fajitas classica.. mmm... I think that is the best way to go. And they are more than willing to give you extra of whatever you ask for. And if you throw in a dollar for them, they ring the bell and yell \"AYYYY\" lol Also, good prices, especially if you split something, which is totally doable since their servings are huge!","The wife and I had dinner at Bajio recently, which I think was our second trip back since my original review.  Based on the track record of the place, I thought any update I did would be to upgrade the ranking, but alas, it is actually to drop a downgrade on them.  \n\nOne reason I'm dropping their grade...the soda fountain still gives out bad soda, either flat or not good tasting depending on what you get.  Since I had the same issue last time, I'm assuming it is an on-going thing, not just my luck.  Another reason, my refried beans were not very good.  I remember getting them in the past and they were fine, but this batch had way too much bacon flavor for my taste.  Lastly, my wife ordered the fish tacos.  Part of the problem is that the fish was fried as opposed to grilled.  She wouldn't have got them had she known and didn't even think to ask as generally Bajio seems to indicate they try to be healthy mexican (at least that's what the mission was indicated to us on our first visit when we had a lengthy discussion with the then manager/owner).  Anywho, she was pretty underwhelmed with them.  On the plus side, my sweet green chili quesadilla was very good.\n\nAdding it all up, I'm marking Bajio down to 3 stars.","I should start by saying I'm not really a food savant.  If I like the food in a place; it's good.  If I don't like the food at a place, it's not good.  My senses are not keen enough to pick out the hint of Cayenne pepper used to season the enchilada or whatever.  Regardless onto the review:\n\nAlright.  So this isn't a really big place.  There's outdoor and indoor seating, a couple of big TV's (or maybe just one, I actually don't remember now), and some cool paintings on the walls.  The paintings aren't anything Rembrandt, but for some reason I find them oddly entertaining.\n\nI personally enjoy the food ordering process.  It's the Subway style layout, except with Mexican food.  You get a choice of three types of meat, two types of rice, three types of beans, two types of sauces, plus a bunch of extra stuff.  Personally I don't experiment too much, but I can honestly say the chicken, re-fried beans, Mexican rice, and red sauce is tasty.\n\nThe employees are friendly and put up with the zoned-out, zombie-like way I shuffle about when I'm thinking of what I want to eat, so thank you for that.  They give off a good, fun, I-don't-hate-you-for-being-here vibe and ring a bell when you leave a tip.\n\nSo all in all: good service, good food, good atmosphere.","I don't know if I just went on an off night for the staff ...  Good thing I have a sense of humor.  I decided to keep my order simple, a fried been and cheese burrito.  For some reason they could not get it right and had to start over.  They were all running around behing the counter, everyone had to keep repeating their order as we moved down the line.  They also kept throwing red sauce on top of my burrito when I didn't ask for any.  I gave up and just had to laugh.  I won't be going back anytime soon.  Their trash was overflowing, we had a long wait in line (and it wasn't that busy) plus I didn't think their tortilla chips were good.  If the chips aren't good, I don't go back.","Its back open and better than ever.  New owners.","I wasn't really very impressed. Bajio isn't *bad* by any stretch, but it's certainly nothing to really rave about.\n\nThe prices were a little steep for what you get and everything (keep in mind, this is mexican food) was oddly sweet for some reason...and that struck me oddly. \n\nBurritos and such, served in a very Chipotle-esque fashion, but for a few bucks more than Chipotle. \n\nI don't believe I'll be returning. Not because it was a negative experience, just exceptionally \"meh\".","Quick & Delicious! You can buy authentic tortillas by the bag large and small. Awesome and different chips and queso which is a fave of mine!","Food was ok. Nothing special. Wouldn't go there again mostly because the girl taking our order had a HUGE attitude and wasn't even listening when we were asking her questions. Pretty disappointing. Would have given a little higher rate if the service was better. Also paid $20 for two burritos and it totally wasnt worth the money.","Not bad... \n\n\nNot in love with the salsas.. they are kind of too sweet. Chicken was spicy and the burrito was good.  \n\nJust another burrito place. Not bad, just nothing great. Nothing to me that really makes it stand out.","Mmmmmm shrimp tacos.  I used to live in the Bajio in Mesa.  I feel like I was there once a week.  My favorite Mexican food.  The shrimp tacos have a honey sauce that is to die for and the tortillas are cooked on the griddle just long enough to keep them from getting soggy.  Really good stuff.  Plus the queso is wicked good.  This location is a bit pricier than the old Mesa one was but at least it is still open.  They also serve beer out here because it's not Mesa.  Much love for the No.Pho Bajio...just wish it wasn't so far.","I really do hate Mexican food.  I'm too picky to enjoy the massive amounts of pepper flavors and onions that permeate this type of food.  However, there is one place on earth that I would choose to get Mexican food any day of the week.  Bajio!\n\nI was actually introduced to this place while I was in Utah and was ecstatic to find it here in AZ.  There used to be one on Stapley that we went practically every time we went out to the EV.  Unfortunately, that location is no longer.  Anyway, Bajio prepares high quality and flavorful food that doesn't break the bank.  My favorite items are the ones with the shrimp.  Just trust me and get it, you can thank me later.  Their salads are also really great and a nice alternative to the heavier fare.\n\nI really wish that Bajio would come downtown and make my dreams come true, but until then, I guess I'll have to make the trek up here to get it.","Located across from Lowe's.  Easy to be tempted by Ray's Pizza just a couple doors down though.  Their burritos are made in front of you there and served in a large basket.  Portions were generous but the prices were up there to match.  Parking isn't bad at all because of the Lowe's lot.","I want to create a time line showing how Bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation. I can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping point into bad food territory. \n\nThanks to Henry Ford, this place uses an assembly line to create the Americanized Mexican food that it churns out for its customers. I usually get a plain bean and cheese burrito because I'm not a big fan of most of their toppings. I've always liked that the food comes with free chips and salsa. \n\nI've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos, and everything is just so-so. I want this place to return to its former glory with the shouting for tips such, but I think that the current environment is here to stay.","The downward spiral is complete...the wife was going to eat Bajio tonight while I was going to pick up L&L.  Our plans were foiled as Bajio is CLOSED (letter on the door indicating non-payment).","Pretty good lunch for a fast food type Mexican food restaurant. Like most modern chains it's not too cheap. I prefer coming here rather than other nearby chains as their lines are almost always half as long and I don't have to wait 30 minutes to eat.","My family used to love eating here, but it's gone way downhill. Our last to-go order just wasn't cooked right and was un-appetizing. Not a huge deal, we'll just call 'em and they'll make it right.. right? The number on the receipt was out of service. After my wife finally got ahold of someone, they said they would have a manager call us back. Never happened, guess we will have to do a chargeback now. After reading this place is family owned, it makes me sad to see a once beautiful place serving delicious food lose all passion.","Great causal Mexican food. Better than Chipotle IMO. Decent price, good selection, lots of variety.","Not bad for a Chipotle-ish layout.  I tend to like the americanized Chipotle food better, but I've just had Bajio's salads so far.  \n\nThe only issue with the salads... they are SOAKED by the time you are finishing your meal, so it's not crunchy anymore.\n\nOther than that, like the paintings on the walls, the mexican feel.  I hear the nachos are RIDICULOUS.  I will be trying more foods later on, but so far it's pretty good.","Best burrito bar in the valley.  Quality ingredients, friendly staff, and loads of food.\n\nWell worth the extra drive compared to other similar restaurants.","This place has a Chipotle feel but has more of that New Mexico Mexican food atmosphere. There food is okay and reasonably priced. Salsa really makes the food for me, and there salsa is just okay. I normally order there chicken quesadilla or get an enchilada and would recommend both.","They need to make a pink fish taco.","Atmosphere is great for dining but the \"Chipotle-Style\" line you go through to order your food while they prepare it in front of you is less than appealing.  But hey... at least you can see what they are doing while making your food? :)\n\nMy wife and I had a burro and some enchildas and they were both very good.  The homemade chips are a little greasy but other than that, they have a great salsa bar televisions with sporting events so that you can enjoy a good game while having your Mexican food."],"business_id":"7Zo1DzdwZlGMxPu1AFMSsw","name":"Bajio Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Me and my wife have been here 2 or 3 times and I've never been that into posting a negative yelp review but man o man does this place deserve one. This place is terrible flat out. The food is so inconsistent that you can order the same thing over and over again and it'll taste different every time. \n\nThe price isn't even the problem but charging as much as they do for sub par food that's just a rip off. And make sure you have plenty of time because you won't be getting your food or refills anytime soon.\n\nI brought my mom here for mother's day and it took them 1 hour to get us guacamole and some coconut shrimp which were so rubbery I could have probably used them for tires. Our server didn't care, he didn't come check up on us, and I think we got probably 1 refill on our drinks in the hour we waited. We had to ask every time for refills on chips and salsa and track down the bus boys and anyone that worked there pretty much to give us some service. After an hour and some minutes me and my family left. I tried to pay for what we ordered but the servers said it was on the house. What a gesture, for a complete waste of time. I tried paying 3 times because I didn't want them to give me anything for free. Pay what you owe, that's what I say. The price is high but if this place had better service it would be fine.","I hate to leave a two star review for this restaurant, but I believe in being honest.  First a couple of positives:\n\n--The atmosphere is great.  Really nice decoration and ambiance; a pleasant place to sit and enjoy a meal.\n\n--Wait staff was very attentive.\n\nSo why the two stars?  The food was simply not Mexican.  Not to say it was bad (well, it wasn't great either), but it was most definitely not the Mexican cuisine of which my wife and I are so fond.  We just moved down from Seattle, WA where I have had much better Mexican.  Being so close to the border, I expected more from our first Mexican food experience here in Arizona.\n\nI think what should have tipped me off is that I didn't see a single Hispanic person on the staff.  So, really, this is more like a white-person's take on Mexican-inspired cuisine.  Maybe it could be re-classified as \"Vaguely-Mexican Food\".\n\nI WILL go back though and will update this review if anything changes.","Went here on a whim with my husband. We were going to the Deli on San Tan Blvd but they were closed because the owners were on vacation. Pleasantly surprised! Food was delicious, cooked well and ambiance was great. Cute little spot out in the middle of nowhere! Really enjoyed our chicken/beef enchiladas and chimichanga with two margaritas. Will definitely return, servers were great and food/drink was reasonably priced. The only things that were a little off were that a little spider that we saw on our tablecloth and there were cobwebs in the door frame where we were sitting.","Great place and the best food I ever tasted and the service is the best , I feel like home in casa de Mina. I would rate it 10 stars . Is a must GO !!","If you're looking for authentic mexican - this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for a Tex Mex BBQ joint masking as a Fine Mexican restuarant this IS the place for you.  We tried the shredded beef tacos and shredded pork burro.  The tacos were good - not as good as Los Dos Molinos or Guedo's though.  The burro had so much BBQ sauce I could only eat about 1/3 before I gave up.  The rice was delicious and the refried beans were ok - a little too much BBQ sauce again.  The chips and salsa were good.  Drinks were a little expensive - $4.25 for Dos Equis.  Service was almost too effecient.  It seemed they wanted us out of there quickly - never asked if we wanted another drink and kept coming back to clear plates.  Very nice service staff, simple atmosphere, nice patio,  prices a little too high.  Not authentic enough for me to return.","I've had the Salmon with mango salsa twice now.  Each meal was excellent, the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I look forward to returning.","Awesome service, tasty food, strong margaritas, what more could you ask for?  We had the chicken quesadilla to start, and I had the chicken tortilla soup.  I did have to add salt to the soup and also threw in some salsa to kick it up a notch on the spice factor, but overall 2 thumbs up.  We'll likely be back.","Well I drove from Ahwatukee to QC to check this place out with a local San Tan Friend. It's really out there (distance wise) but well worth the drive. Good pour on the house margaritas and good drink as well. The food was presented well, hot and delicious. I most likely would have given it a 5 star but I have to say even though it was overcast that day they need to turn the AC up a bit....I was glowing (and not from pleasure of the food) throughout the meal - Wouldn't want to experience it on a full sun / hot day for sure unless then they aren't so frugal with the A/C.....phew!\n\nOh, the salmon and mango tacos rocked ! Good \"chips\" too....with the salsa...","I really wanted to be blown away by this place.  Although it is better than the previous restaurant in this location, El Rico, it fell w-a-y short of my expectations.  \n\nMany of the other reviewers gave such high ratings that I literally drove the mile and a half down the road with my mouth watering.  We arrived and sat inside and downstairs.  The ambiance was not so great. We heard everyone else's conversations and the chandelier lighting was sharp bright and made my pupils itch.  Then the salsa arrived.  Hmm... sweet instead of heat.  I didn't like how the salsa was served really cold either. Then I ordered the carne burro.  It was OK.  But the enchilada sauce was nasty. Oh, and the rice and beans were \"turable!\" (as Charles Barkley would say).  Lastly, my girl had awful gas after we got home and kept denying it.  Not a great outing.","Good food,  good service,  good music,  good experience","Three and a half stars but Yelp doesn't allow halfs. We used to come here when it was El Rico's and were bummed when it closed. We've been jonesing for a new local place. \n\nThe service was good and attentive.\n\nMy margarita was pretty strong and tasty. \n\nThe salsa they put on the table is extremely mild but if you ask for hot they bring out a salsa verde that doesn't mess around! I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice but I mixed it with the red. \n\nI got the carne asade and enjoyed it. The meat was a little on the salty side on its own but good with all the accompaniments. My dining partner ordered the chicken chimi and said it was good but nowhere near as good as Jim's Burros on Ocatillo. \n\nAtmosphere is good except we didn't like the Mexican elevator music. All tables have tablecloths, which I associate with more formal establishments. That's not a complaint, just an observation.\n\nWe'll definitely go back and try other things. Outdoor dining will be nice once it cools down.","Everything was pretty good and the menu had a few different takes on Mexican food that I've never seen before. They serve a sweet salsa and a regular, but the food is still pretty good! The sopapillas were pretty damn good for desert! Margaritas were great too! It was not like a regular chain so I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area!","Great Margaritas! Authentic Mexican food! Salsa not super Spicy, but you can ask for the hot salsa and you will not be dissapointed!! My favorite are the seafood enchiladas, and the shrimp tacos. great staff...beautiful camino real hacienda.","This is one of the finest Mexican restaurants we have ever eaten in.We got\nOff the flight from one of those lousy united airline flights from Chicago ,\nStarving and dying of thirst to end up at casa De Mina being served by\nA top notch Waiter and being personally greeted by one of the owners\nChristian who remembered us from six months ago. We had a nacho\nPlatter with chicken and beef, the finest salsa we have ever eaten, and\nOne of the most amazing margaritas. The seafood enchilada and Salmon\nTacos were better than any Mexican fare we get in Chicago.   This place\nRocks,,,.,,..","I've been here a few times and let me tell you it's been a great experience in every visit, one of my two favorite appetizers is the nachos with carne Asada and the chorizo with queso, I could just keep coming back for these two,along with a beer at their newly added bar which by the way the variety it's pretty awesome, they have all kinds of tequilas you just wanna try them all haha! I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!","I am not a mexican food fan, it seems like everything tastes the same at most palaces. Not at Casa De Mina... this place is the best! You can tell everything is home made. The ingredients were fresh and top notch. Well run, very clean, everything we ate was outstanding. I had the seafood enchiladas. They were fabulous. The shrimp (and there were plenty in there) were fresh, and flavorful. I would give it 6 stars if that rating was available.","The place has a great feel to it. I had the carne asada and it was OK.","This is hard to rate because I have been here a few times and the food is always excellent. However, I went for Mother's Day, and the service was so terrible it will make me hesitate to return despite the fact that the food is great. I made a reservation for a large party in the middle of the week. No problem. I was excited because I had out of town family coming in and was raving about the place. Plus it was Mother's Day, and I was excited to relax and not have to cook and clean my kitchen. When we arrived, they had no record of our reservation, but they sat us immediately, which I thought was kind of them. After that, it was downhill. We had to keep flagging other people down to get refills on our drinks, and we waited over an hour for our food. One of our party is a diabetic, and he was getting rather nervous because everything was taking so long. We also had small children who were holding up super well, but were super hungry. In the meantime, there was no apology from our waitress nor was there any checking in from her. We had to flag her down to ask what was going on. When our food finally came, one of the entrees was wrong. We asked our server to correct it, but it NEVER came. When it came time to pay, we asked for a break since we had a bad experience. They only took the bad entree off, and we had to talk to the manager to explain our situation. He gave us another discount. Then it took FOREVER to try and pay. I ended up having to give our bill to the hostess to close it out for us. We were extremely disappointed. We have loved coming here in the past and recommend it to our families and friends, but now we are not so sure. I have worked in food service for 15 years, so I know what it can be like on holidays, and I am always willing to cut servers slack because I know how it can be. But this was unacceptable. Perhaps our server was new, but if she was, then she should not have been working on a holiday. The restaurant has been in business long enough to know how to handle a holiday, and to know what basic customer service is.","A little pricey for the amount of food.  Good Salsa.  Pass on the Sopapillas, they are not authentic.","Excellent mexican food. Atmosphere is nice and also very clean. Service is really good. Authentic mexican dishes.","Main Points:\n-Beautiful venue and that's where the pros end\n-Better values to be had at any other Mexican restaurant\n-Slow service \n\nReview:\nI really wanted to like this place because it is a beautiful restaurant, and it's parking lot is always full so I was led to believe it was awesome food.  However, after trying it multiple times (fooled again!) I have to say I won't be back.\n\nTheir food has no pizzazz and their salsa is nothing to write home about.  Considering they are in the two dollar sign price range ($$), I would expect much better food than what they offer.  One of the times we went, there weren't too many customers there (but they were fully staffed) and we spent almost 2 hours there because service was so slow, even though we ordered a total of two dishes for two of us. There was a bigger group of about 8 outside who already had their food, and their kids were running in and out of the restaurant screaming at the top of their lungs past everyone's' table and none of the staff said a word to them (and their parents didn't care either).  \n\nI would say considering they're in Arizona they should step up their game when it comes to Mexican food but obviously there are enough people eating there already, so I guess they don't need my advice.  Since it's so popular with others, maybe it's worth a try, just don't go with high hopes.","Very good!  Had the spinach enchilada and shrimp cerviche,","I am glad something opened up here in the old El Rico's spot, and it is very good. I was going to order a carne asada burrito but the kid, errrr, waiter serving me suggested that I should have the chimi with red sauce. Good choice. It was extremely good. Red salsa and hot salsa weren't that great, but the green was delicious. I will be back, maybe tomorrow night hehe.\n\nNo alcohol permit yet, in case you feel like a marg.","The service was AWESOME!!! The food was great!! Portions were a little too small for me,  but I'll definitely be back!! \n\nHopefully they have an alcohol license now... :-)","2 transplants and 4 Midwesterners had a delightful lunch today. Seafood enchilada's were wonderful, pork & chicken quesadilla's with meat and cheese aplenty.   Pork, beef & cheese enchiladas were very good and the refried beans & rice were very good as well.","Picked the salmon dinner tonight and it was one of the best I have had. It had a mango sauce that complimented the salmon  perfectly.  Will come back again.","The hostess are very helpful and friendly. The servers are hit or miss. The nachos are great! The salads are fresh and have great presentation. The ambience is nice but wish they would enhance their drink menu. The margaritas are not very good. This place has a lot of potential!","We called ahead of time, but they refused to take our order over the phone (we were a large group in a hurry). Our waitress insisted she could get us in and out quickly, but didn't. Service was slow and the waitress was anything but friendly. At the end she even got upset with our big group when we asked for separate checks... will not go again!","Great place. Good Food!!. Glad we found this place. Server and staff were attentive, but not hovering. It is a step above casual, but not formal. All of the tables have tableclothes, which we found nice.\nRed salsa is not spicy at all, but if you ask for the Hot Salsa it is HOT. I mixed some of the Hot into the red and it was great. Green salsa is good. My wife had the Salmon and said it was very good. I had Shrimp taco, Fish taco, rice and beans. it was very good also. We will definitely be back again.","It was our first time coming in and we though the food was alright. It was cold when it came out, but if it was warmer it would of been amazing. Also the service was horrible. But it may only be because it has recently opened.","Hit and Miss.  I was here once and it was really really good.  For my 2nd trip I brought family here from out of town and everything was dissapointing.  We made reservations, they were not busy, but when we arrived they had to put tables together and ended up seating us a solid 10 minutes late.  I ran into a friend in the lobby who said he was waiting for a half hour for a take out burrito! Then they forgot to assign us a waiter, when one noticed later he scrambled to get our orders.  The service problems continued, but I think this waiter was trying his best, it just may have been a little too little too late to bring our moods back up.  The food was not great this night, pollo asada and carne asada overcooked, the rest of the food was underwhelming.  I will give them another shot, but my impression is that they were really disorganized.   The old restaurant that was in this location was good but seemed to have the same problem.  Someone needs to put an experienced manager in here who can make the food consistent and the service good, and this place could be great.","First time trying this place and will come back. The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. \n\nThe lunch portions are great size and accompanied with delicious chips and salsa. If you want the hotter salsa you have ask for it. \n\nI ordered the Spinach Enchilada were good if you love leafy spinach. Did not care for all the ends with the enchilada.","I joined Yelp just to write a review of this place. My wife and I visited for the first time a few months ago and have been back several times since. I'm not a big fan of the usual Mexican fare that comes standard at most places; enchiladas, flautas, chile rellano, not my cup of tea. While Casa de Mina does have similar items on their menu, they also have refreshingly different choices. The salmon with mango salsa is outstanding, and the seafood tacos are unbelievable.","I have been there twice. No liquor. Today being 11/21/12 I called them and they do have their liquor license. They have 2 kinds of Margaritas, beer and wine.  We are going there for dinner tonight.","Well where to start this is the 4th time I've been to this restaurant and each time something new (and worse) is experienced.  We were the 1st table to be seated at 6:15 PM on a weekday \"so that tells a story\".  The food is usually pretty good (very bland) for mex taste though.  The salsa is super mild (like diced tomatoes) but I guess that's better than choking hot.\nThey serve in a condiment size bowl (we had 4 at our table) and had to ask at least 6 times for refills.  Chips very hard but ok, served in a wicker basket also very small (we had to have refills at least 4 times), oh !! did I mention we also had to ask for refillls.\n\nThe 2 waiters never did anything refills, clean off dirty dishes or ask if wanted more coke refills at any time. \" we had to ask for them\". BAD especially when it wasn't busy AT ALL !!  We asked for sour cream (1 dollup) which cost $1 (wow can you spare it).  The cheese crisp was cool not hot and definitely not crispy..Just like we got melted cheese no tortilla base at all !!.\n\nUnfortuntaley, we would like to recommend (nice decor and food itself was\ndecent but the service NOT) the far SE Valley needs this type of clean and decor for mexican dining.  To many fast food type going up all the time.\nBut, we all know unless they spiff up the service they will always have a empty dining room.\n\n\nUNHAPPY IN GILBERT RESIDENT","This place doesn't even deserve one star. My boyfriend and I went there on Cinco de Mayo and we had reservations for 8pm. When we got there they weren't busy but there was a group of 5 that had been waiting for almost two hours for a table. We sat ourselves, had to go ask for menus, had to ask for chips and salsa, and had to ask for our server to come take our order. My boyfriend got food poisoning that night. For being such a fun location and environment, the service and food sucked.","2nd time here. Place was busy, service was good, food great as always, seafood enchiladas are the bomb.\n\nI also recommend the beef nachos, big portion.\n\nStrong Margaritas","So glad Yelp helped me find this place - had the chicken enchiladas suizas - very tasty - green sauce was just right - not smothered or over-powered - beans were a little burnt tasting but the rice was great","10/2/12...\nFirst time here. Nicely decorated little restaurant. Nice patio area also. We were here on Tuesday night. Very quiet. \n\nThe don't have alcohol license yet. But we were told they should have it soon. \n\nOrdered safe for first time. Chicken Enchilada Suiza. And Chicken Chimichanga.  Also Queso Fundido for appetizer.\n\nThe food was just average. The Fundido was a little greasy. \n\nThere is no alcohol served at this time.  Not that this is a requirement, but just for informational purposes.  (Please note date of my visit as this may have changed since.)\n\nA nice little place for a quick meal. Nothing that I would go out of my way for. \n\nAlso, they have very nice outdoor garden area. Be interested to see if they actually put this along with the upstairs balcony area to use.","This place is great! Great service and the food was amazing. I had the Ranchero Shrimp Tacos. The sauce was delicious. The horchata is the best I've tasted. Definitely will be returning soon.","I liked this place a lot. I had fun eating outside on the patio. Red and green salsa taste great - but are not hot. I'm a wuss, so this worked out well - the flavors are great on both of them. They make both of them in house as well.\n\nReally, get here. They need more business so they can grow into something even better than they are now!","The service really was the killer here.  We got seated right away but didn't see our waiter for a long time.  When he finally showed up he apologized but made no improvement on it.  You know its bad when we got to know the bus boy's first name.  The food was decent, though I am not a fan of sweet salsa (green), the Pollo Asada was good, I especially enjoyed the chargrilled peppers with it.  We may try it again just in case but not anytime soon.","Red salsa had a nice flavor but zero spice. Green salsa was a bit bland. Asked for the hot salsa, which is definitely spicy, but not a lot of flavor. \n\nMeals were average. (1) The bolillo (bread for the torta) was a tad try and just not up to par and that spoiled the torta. (2) The chile rellenos were good but the red sauce a bit bland. (3) The taco salad was very good and the chicken inside was great but it was way too small and person left quite hungry after. (4) The spinach enchiladas were bland and lacked flavor. \n\nService was erratic. Tortilla chips were brought quickly but we had to ask for salsa  five minutes later because it had yet to come. Then we had to ask for napkins and silverware. Only the silverware came and we again had to ask for napkins. \n\nNot going back too soon. Other family members have had a good experience so we'll eventually try it again. There was a very large party there on the night we dined but no excuses allowed.","If it were an option to give zero stars, I would.  My wife and I heard good things about this place so we figured we'd try it out.  Upon arrival we waited fifteen minutes to be seated (not too big a deal). After being seated our waiter came by after about five minutes and took our drink order( two waters and a horchata) after 10 minutes we got our drinks (too long in my opinion) we waited 20 minutes for our waiter to come back and take our order (too long in my opinion) After placing our food order it finally came out after waiting for 30 minutes (way too long). Here is where I started to get agitated. I ordered a carne asada burrito with no salsa fresca and no garnish. It came out with garnish but before I could say anything our waiter took off. I figured I would just move the lettuce and tomato over to the side of the plate and eat my burrito minus some sauce and cheese. I took a bite and nearly gagged as it was full of onions and other things in their salsa fresca. Once again I ordered the burrito without salsa fresca and garnish. I waited 18 minuts for the waiter to come back and ask how everything was. I told him that I ordered my carne asada burrito without salsa fresca and garnish. He apologized and took it back. 12 minutes later he brought me back a burrito with garnish on the side which I didn't want but at least it wasn't on the burrito this time. Then I cut the burrito and noticed it wasn't a carne asada burrito. They made me a shredded beef burrito with salsa fresca. Instead of waiting for my waiter  to come back or a server to get him, I went and found him and POLITELY explained that my order was wrong again. I asked if I could please have a carrne asada burrtio, no salsa fresca and no garnish to go ( at this point we had been there over two hours and missed our showtime. I was starting to get angry as I waited for 10 minutes and still did not have my order. I asked my wife if she would mind payng the bill because I needed to go outside and walk off my frustration. She called after I had been outside for fifteen minutes to tell me that they brought me a carane asada chimichanga with salsa fresca so she had to reorder again. After another ten minutes,  she came outside with a carne asada chimichanga (four times and they never got it right) Here is the kicker, they charged us full price!!! I paid full price for food I never ordered. The waiter was nice and explained there was a huge party outside and they had new cooks. I understand that part but 4 TIMES!!!! and you charge me full price? REALLY? This is the absolute worst customer experience I have ever experienced.","Casa De Mina. The old El Rico's building.  I came for lunch. Decor was warm and inviting. Staff was friendly. I ordered a cheese enchilada with red sauce from the lunch menu. The service was quick and the enchilada was EXCELLENT.  I also got a Margarita. YUM. I will be back. SECRET MENU order a Carne Asada Chimichanga with red sauce. Old El Rico's patrons; you are missing out if you haven't visited.","Absolutely Amazing! From the service ( Leana rocks) to the salsa (green salsa!!) To the amazing meals. 5 stars across the board. Very cozy ambiance, great patio and pretty solid drinks. Not overly priced for what you get , my only complaint was the chimi was more tortilla than filling but still fantastic. Highly, highly recommended!"],"business_id":"7mP8w08JiqlyDzdF-Ui62Q","name":"Casa De Mina","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["We were tight on time so we stopped here for a late lunch after stumbling along Rt 88 for several hours.\n\nWe sat on the patio. A very vibrant lunch crowd.  We were greeted immediately and drinks came quickly. Order was taken by a very polite, young man.  Our 3 orders of Diablo Enchiladas arrived. Excellent!\n\nA very nice oasis on a dusty trail. Being from NH, we don't get the greatest of Mexican cuisine. This was very good and memorable!","I used to go there was good food and the price was reasonable but now the food is sort of fairy and the price is skyrocket. Not worth going there.","Los Gringos is a good place to stop before heading out on the Apache Trail.  My husband and I stopped by the family-owned place and ordered up some delicious tex-mex style food.  \nThe food is cheap and delicious and the large rooms make it feel like a Chevy's or other chain tex-mex place you're used to eating at already. Friendly service - and check out the electronic ordering pads!","excellent views of the mountains, very laid back atmosphere with a very attentive staff, overall a good place to spend a relaxing lunch","I'm a hard-cord SoCal foodie, so coming to the 'junction in the A-Z isn't always a culinary delight.  Gotta say, I was really pleasantly surprised by this place.  The food is well-prepared, tex-mex style - more veggies, citrus, not as much lard/grease.  Portions are decent size (not \"bistro\"), and the service is spot-on. The kitchen has clearly got its act together.  Our stuff arrived relatively quickly - done to perfection - and piping hot.  They've got outside seating, which looks pretty nice, and the full bar doesn't hurt either.  Price?  Very reasonable.  Triple Z snap from me - we'll be back.","Excellent Mexican food, with a whole page of fish dishes (my favorites).  Also outdoor dinning and breakfast.","After some Hobby Lobby shopping with my dtr., sis, and mom, we headed to this place. First of all I was shocked there was this type of restaurant in AJ. Friendly greeting right away is always a plus. Chips and salsa came right away and were yummy.My daughter asked for hot sauce and it wasn't very good, so we stuck to the salsa. Our waitress came, took our drink orders and left us to peruse the menu which had a very nice selection of food. Our drinks came, dtr. and sis had a beer, mom had a margarita on the rocks with ice, and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. Egads, I should have stayed with my usual\" on the rocks\" as my margarita was the only bad thing of my experience here. It got a 1 out of 10 limes. I was encouraged to send it back but decided just to drink it...should have sent it back. It tasted like the bartender used a really bad margarita mix, and the strawberry did not seem fresh at all. Yuck Yuck.\nOn to the food-with all the choices I still stuck with my favorite item to order, a chile relleno plate. It was very good. It arrived hot and cheesy. Sometimes at mexican restaurants the food arrives semi-hot and the cheese has already started to \"harden\". My dtr. had a bean chimichanga and said it was good. My mom had cheese enchiladas and said they were ok.  My sis had a chimichanga and beer...she said the chimi was good but the beer was kind of warm. The restaurant is cute, and our waitress was very nice. If my margarita had been good I could have given 5 stars easy.","The salsa sucked.  The food was ok.  Being a native Arizonan I am hard to fool.  When you look at the clientele dining here you will know what I mean....","Yelp was not so helpful on our food hunt in Apache Junction. We went on a nice hike and found ourselves very hungry. Rather than driving back to Phoenix to eat, we decided to YELP search out something yummy and well reviewed in the area. Mexican sounded appealing, so Los Gringos won out.\n\nWe arrived quickly and found ample parking (as if we wouldn't in Apache Junction). We were seated quickly and offered drinks. About 15 minutes passed without our water. We were quite parched from the hike and the heat and desperately wanted water. Do I need to get it myself? Finally, when I was about to trip the waitress, she noticed us looking like cacti and brought us water. She apologized and took our order. Enchilada Poblano and a grande burrito.\n\nIt seemed like forever until our food came. We also had to ask for water refills several times. It seemed like the wait staff just disappeared for long stretches at a time. The wrong dish was served to me, though it ended up looking far better than what did finally arrive. The food was average. I cannot say that I was impressed and I also can not say it was bad. It just filled my belly but did not make me jump for joy. I do not think Mexican usually does, but I was hoping.\n\nOverall, meh is about right. I was terribly disappointed by the service, despite them all being very nice. I just expect to not be forgotten for 10 plus minutes at a time. I will not be back here.... but I will also not likely be back in Apache Junction. I recommend you try another place in Apache Junction, though, if you are looking for something good.","I have been going to this place for almost 5 years now and it has always been good. From the time you walk in and notice the great decorations and the smells of sizzling fajitas. You are greeted by friendly staff people who actually seem happy to see you and then are given a choice of where you would like to sit. \n\nThey do offer seating outside on the patio but the inside is best given it is usally over a 100 during the summer time and they always keep it nice and cool. The menu is not very large and features old school Mexican fare such as tacos, burritos, and rice and beans. Now if that was all they offered I would still suggest going there. One of the things that makes this place really great is the fact that they give you Free Fresh chips AND salsa!! How about that?? \n\nNo over priced stale tortilla chips and jar pace picante sauce, but great tasting free food ( not normally seen hence the reason for the caps). They have a full bar stocked with every kind of mood altering beverage you could want to pour down your throat to chase that extra cheesy mouth full of queso dip you are going to want to order as a starter. Warm with a little bit of spice to give it a little kick it is the best way to get your dinner started right. \n\nIf you are really in the mood for a few drinks, some great food for the after work crowd or a nice family style sit and eat some good food type place then this is the spot for you. (NOTE) Make sure to go there during happy hour as the drinks are much cheaper and the SUPER BIG nachos are half off. They also serve breakfast on Sunday if you are looking for a new Sunday breakfast joint.","I've been going here at least once a week with coworkers lately. This is definitely the best sit down restaurant in Apache Junction. The salsa is absolutely addicting, the servers are friendly (and technologically advanced with their neat little electronic order pads), and the food is plentiful and delicious. I like to get the chicken breast lunch meal when I go for lunch, and have yet to find a definitive favorite when going to dinner, since that is more rare. They're really good about bringing your food out quickly when you mention you're on your lunch break.\n\nThey need to sell the salsa in bottles!","Lots (tons) of tequilas to chose from, many TVs in bar dining area. Has a main dining area also, as well as an outdoor patio with  mist system & umbrella shades, and I do believe a smoking area.  In winter they have the huge gas heating lamps.  The chips and salsa are complementary and refills are gladly given.  The food is traditional gringo-mexicano, (I like mild spiciness, so I can't say if their hotter items are for the true Mexican food lover). It is very similar to Macayo's, but less expensive. Always served hot and fresh, so food coming to your table is a little slow at times.  I always get the chimichanga with beef.  I tried the lime shrimp which was tasty but 6 medium sized crustacians with a huge bed of boring rice for $14 was not a great meal. They have a green horney enchilada which is very good.  The fried ice cream is about $5 and  a decent sized scoop.","Decent Mexican food. Always have had great service. My husband and I usually split a meal and that fills is up no problem. Lobe their salsa.","I wasn't that impressed.  But we might have just gone on a bad night.  The waiter told us that their computers were down so they were doing everything by hand.  So our waiter took our order (and didn't write anything down).  We got one meal that was slightly wrong (ground beef instead of shredded beef) and our appetizer came out with our entrees.  \n\nThe food was just okay...I've had better.  Not likely to go back.","Good Happy Hour with discount apps and drinks.  Enjoyed the chips and salsa with hot sauce on the side.  The mini chimi platter app was delicious.  Would be five stars except prices were a tad high even with the Happy Hour discount.","The food is always excellent and the service is great as well.  \n\nThey have the best chips and salsa in the valley.  A nice outdoor patio too!","Love the salsa, can't beat it if you like it somewhat mild.   Chips and salsa plus the hot salsa are free, and refilled in a snap.  Food is excellent and the menu varied.   Never been disappointed.\nIt is always clean, outside patio with mist and a smoking section, TVs throughout the bar area.  Service has been terrific.  Food is served hot and with fresh ingredients.  Parking on private lot, well lit.","It was okay last year - nothing great but nothing bad.  Maybe it's because we've had some pretty great food this last year, but we weren't pleased with this place and will not return..  The food on the plate ran together.  It looked like soup.  We couldn't even make out the enchiladas as they were covered with the rice and soup-like sauce.   It was an awful presentation.  The sauce around the edges of the plate looked like it had been overcooked and burned.  The meat in the taco was seasoned really weird.  It was awful.  I couldn't eat it.  We love Mexican food and this place is at the bottom of the barrel.  The service was slow and food took forever.","There are not many restaraunts in Apache Junction that are clean, not packed wall to wall with snow birds, and serve decent food.  I realise I may be missing out but I tend to avoid restaraunts in older buildings with dirt lots.  There are a lot of those in AJ,  That being said, Los Gringos Locos is a new building in a nice parking lot, with lots of nice clean things inside and out of it.  That gets me in the door.  The food is ok there.  I have never had anything great there, or anything even better than average.  It is normal \"chain\" restaraunt mexican food.  It's ok. I think a lot people go there because of the building, and service.  Top notch.  Not because of the food which is mediocre.","Came here with a huge group recently. We had 65+ people on the patio and the wait staff handled it like champs. I bought some tasty burrito that's supposed to be the best seller there and enjoyed my beer, but I wish you had craft beer. The patio is very nice & everyone was older so it was pretty chill there.","Mediocre, corporately-bland Mexican food (as one would expect from a chain restaurant, even though Los Gringos apparently isn't). The perky waitress either didn't deliver my simple request to the kitchen or they ignored it: I asked for my Chimichanga extra crispy, it arrived soft and doughty. Good chips & salsa, but that should be a given. Wouldn't go back and can only assume the diners giving four or five stars to Los Gringos have never had top flight Mexican. It you think the Olive Garden is good Italian food, this might be the place you; otherwise steer clear.","I really like this place! Since we live in Tucson and my mom lives in Gold Canyon, this is my girls and I favorite place to dine when we're in the area.\n\nI have never had a bad meal here! The service is usually pretty good but sometimes you have to ask more than once for something. \n\nI think they have the best green corn tamales I've ever had! (way better than Tucson Tamale Company's tamales)  \n\nThe patio is very nice and large so the tables are not jammed together. They have a full bar and the margaritas are YuMmY.","After 4 visits here, I feel comfortable saying that this is my favorite Mexican restaurant (thus far) in the area. The food is good, service varies from great to at least decent, and the prices aren't too bad. Full bar with a good selection of beers and mixers. I'm not a margarita drinker but I've been told by several friends that they are great here. The only thing that I've tried that I didn't really care for was the mole sauce which I found too bitter and overpowering. I recommend this place!!!!","Los Gringos Locos is my own personal desert oasis in the Far East Valley! This larger-sized, but cozy-feeling restaurant is \"just right\" if you're looking for a casual Mexican sitdown where you and your friends and family can enjoy loads of complimentary chips and salsa, interesting daily drink specials from a fully stocked bar and an assortment of very tasty south-of-the-border food fare at a price that won't break the bank! \n\nThough the menu selections consist mostly of predictable Mexican restaurant favorites, portions are generous and the quality of the food is very good. \n\nMy personal suggestion is to grab a hot n' flaky, sour cream and guacamole-topped Chimichanga and split it with your significant other! The Chimi, like most of the entrees, comes loaded with lots of meat inside, plus rice and beans on the side, for around $10. With the complimentary chips and salsa, neither you nor your loved one will leave hungry! Plus, you can each toss a mixed drink on the tab and still get out for under $20! Now, that's a \"cheap\" date that she'll actually thank you for!\n\nFor a solid and safe choice when it comes to restaurant-quality Mexican food, Los Gringos Locos is certainly an excellent value at the Far-East end of the Phoenix Metro area!","My brother took me here when I was out visiting. He really liked this place so we went here. I ordered the green chili and corn tamales and loved them! They had a kind of sweet and spicy taste to them. They were soft and delicious! This place is a little pricey, but very tasty and awesome service! We sat outside and there is a really nice waiter out there but I cannot remember her name. I would love to go here again the next time I visit AZ. \nP.S.... my brother is a crazy white boy.","I went here on mothers day and had to ask for some one to serve us as an apology we was given free soapapeas that was grose tasting....the bread did not seem to be fully cooked and looked like it was sitting around for an hr or two the put in the micowave and served with only a small bit of powdered suger on one part of it. I would not have given a tip so the only thing that save the servers tip was that I was rong about a wab site that I talked to the manager about. I also would have walked out but realy wanted a sangria. The food later made me run for the restroom later on that night.... Iv been here befor in the day time and the service was some what ok. The food was good but if u go at night be there befor 7pm cuz they close at 8pm and at night the service sucks. I realy will not take any of my kinfoke here if they came to vist..I would rather travel to phoenix to arriba mexican grill or makios or garcias or cheveys they are much better. For the people that thought it is not help-full I can bet you work for this awful place....the service sucks big wet green donkey dicks and I hope the owner really thinks about firing the whole staff except for the cooks. . . . Managers and wait stuff can F*#$...off.","Had the chili releno and white corn tamale. Yummo! For a mainstream Mexican restaurant the food was good still good. Just a bit too pricey when you can get the same or better at other places.","We only gave LGLG&C 3 stars because we are still deciding...we will need to visit again. \n\nOn the up side...super clean restaurant, great hot chips quickly arrived with delicious pico and hot sauce, great service by all including Tony who kept our drinks full and was always available when we needed him plus good happy hour prices.\n\nOn the down side...the nachos were the only food we ordered as we are nacho lovers. But they left us a little underwhelmed especially at $10. The chicken in green chili sauce was delicious but the dry chips, sporadic cheddar cheese and sparse refried beans made for a bit of a disappointment. We prefer a queso blanco over shredded cheddar as the cheddar cools into blobs.\n\nWe have high hopes for LGLG&C and will visit again and re-yelp our experience.","great tacos.  service is excellent. I called my order in and it was ready when I arrived. I took a picture. awesome","Came here with a large group after a day of tubing on the Salt. The bartender did a great job of accommodating any request we had and the happy hour prices were great!\n\nFor dinner I had the Camarones Verdes, a delicious shrimp and poblano chile dish that was not only pleasing to the tongue but also to the eye. Every part of the dish was perfect - the green rice was beautifully plated and deliciously spiced with the poblanos. Every piece of shrimp was cooked just right and so flavorful.\n\nWe were admittedly a large and rowdy crowd but were treated nicely and our service was great. Thankfully there was another large group (baby shower??) in the same room as us so we weren't the only loud ones in the place. Our young and obviously new server told me it was the first time he'd ever served such a large party and I can say he was GREAT! He honored all requests and kept his wits and sense of humor about the whole thing and our crazy group!\n\nLos Gringos Locos was a welcome spot for us after a long day in the sun and a place I'd be happy to come back and visit.","Nothing to get excited about.  The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.  At least the dinning room is nice, clean, and comfortable.  (unlike many other places in AJ).","This is one of the only restaurants I actually eat at in Apache Junction that is not fast food.\n\nThe food is delicious...I do think it can be a bit expensive for what you get but I've always had really good service and the food I order is always delicious.  I love love love the chips and salsa!  The carne asada is really good!  I've had the guacamole that is made table side and that was also really good!  The cheese crisp is also very good!","We tried LGLG&C again because I just had to know if they could make the nachos better. As before the restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly.\n\nThis time we asked for 'cheese sauce' instead of blobs of shredded cheese (to which the waiter grimaced and said, 'that's much better'...he obviously didn't like their standard nachos either).\n\nIt seemed to be a bit of a big deal as he returned to the table to say, 'it will be a minute they have to get it melted.' But they came out quickly and were delicious! \n\nWe have been popping in for nachos as we run around town and haven't had time for a full meal, once we do I'll update my star rating.","Had the enchiladas poblanos with the wifey... my two favorite kinds of hot and spicy!","this place is great. been going here for years and have never had anything to complain about. when we go to arizona to visit my parents we almost always eat here.","We lived in Apache Junction 1995-2002 and Los Gringos Locos had already opened and we tried it once and never went back. The next ten years we lived in central Mexico in a wonderful artsy historic community called San Miguel de Allende, before having to move back to the US for medical reasons. We actually like our Mexican food a bit gringoized, so the name of this restaurant grabbed us.\n\nLos Gringos Locos is very close to us and we saw their ads that they had brunch on weekends, so we decided to try it out.\n\nSo sorry we did, the service was horribly bad. The booth tables are so flimsy and crowded that we were pushing ours around like a coffee table that wouldn't stay in place whenever we shifted our elbows.\n\nWe finally got chips and an okay pico de gallo, though there was never any question of whether we'd like a chips refill, and the empty bowl sat there by the edge of our table, waiting to be picked up or refilled, for at least half an hour until we were almost done eating while various bus boys and our waiter sauntered by without looking down or around. Most places all the service people look at the customers to see if something is needed; not here. I finally piled straw wrappers and Splenda envelopes into the empty bowl so that it looked over-ready to be picked up and finally it was.\n\nIt took 15 minutes from our finishing our coke and iced tea before our waitress asked if we wanted refills. Hey, our food hasn't even arrived yet--ya think? \n\nIt was Sunday morning and various tables and booths near us were church goers who held hands and prayed loudly over their food, which always arrived long before the silverware. Same with us--we had to request our forks and napkins.\n\nOur waitress was a sloppy grouch to start with, just as well she disappeared most of our visit. I would have liked being asked how things were so that I could request some hot sauce before I was two-thirds done with my meal. \n\nI got a green chili chimichanga which I actually liked a lot. Let that not be forgotten in this mostly negative review. I'd come back for this dish alone, and there were other things on the menu I'd like to try. Maybe on my own. My partner ordered a shredded beef chimachanga and she said the meat filling was kind of gelatinous, like from a really cheap Chinese dive. She was disappointed for a long time afterward while I was licking my lips long afterwards.\n\nThe two burrito platters and cokes came to $35 with taxes--we could have gone to PF Chang's or the Cheesecake Factory and had decent chain food for that price. Serrano's has better food for much less money.\n\nOver-priced, lousy service, erratic food quality, and the whole place was so noisy, with a screaming baby punctuating the praying and loud conversations bouncing off the too-bare walls, that we won't be going back. Too bad, we'll drive the eight miles more to Serrano's on Power and Superstition Springs. Still, those huevos rancheros sounded good, though, and I'd like another green chili chimichanga some day. I'd ask for a table, and look around to make sure no prayer group was convening nearby, and have really low expectations on service.","This place is still open because the snowbirds don't know what real Mexican food is all aabout and there is no where else in AJ to eat.  If you have a car there is no reason to eat here at all.","for thoughs that are giving this place good service reviews wate till u have to run for the restroom later. This place is not a very good place to eat and there are much better places to eat at. I stopped goin here a long time ago. good redens. and i dont care if you think it not usefull.","Good food!! Great prices for breakfast.","We have visited LGLG&C twice in the last month. Both times sitting on the patio and found that the service on the patio was SO BAD that we swore we would never go back. Bad service on top of high prices  are not a good combination, even if the food is good.\n\nBUT after an even worse experience at another local mexican restaurant tonight we put our tails between our legs and went over the LGLG&C to give it one last chance as we were hungry for Mexican food and it was close. This time when we walked in I politely told the sweet hostess that we wanted to sit on the patio but we have always had HORRIBLE service out there and we needed her help to make sure we get a good waiter/waitress who will not leave us to fend for ourselves.\n\nShe was VERY receptive assured us that she would make sure everyone knew, and she did. Our waitress was incredibly attentive, I wish I remembered her name, I would recommend her, but I did make sure her manager knew that she had single handedly changed our impression of their restaurant. \n\nAlso, this time around at LGLG&C there was a lovely woman walking around making sure everyone was happy and a nice man came around shaking hands. It felt like a place you wanted to be as opposed to avoid, which was becoming our opinion. I don't know if this show of enthusiasm was because the neighborhood 'squeaky wheel' was squealing (me) or if it has become standard, but it was a great move in  our book!:)\n\nIt will take more than one good experience for me to change my opinion to 4 stars, but tonight was definitely a step in the right direction. I hope they will keep stepping up their game!\n\nI hope they don't let this place run itself during the summer only to come to town to make sure it's up to standards during the busy season. If that's the case hopefully they will read this and reconsider or hire a strong summer manager as it's the locals that make or break your restaurant.\n\nOne last suggestion for LGLG&C: You charge a premium for your food, but the food is good and I don't mind paying for good food if the service is also good. The only suggestion I would add is that the abundance of beer flags hanging around the patio flapping in the wind really cheapen the setting. Take that part for what it's worth, the tacky flags won't keep me from going back, but they might keep me from taking out of town guests or business associates. Just a thought, I wish you well:)","We only stopped in for a drink but the margaritas had to be the worst I've ever had. I honestly don't think there was any alcohol in it at all it or it was completely watered down. The chips and salsa were very good. The bartenders weren't the mist friendly but they weren't the worst. I probably wouldn't ever go here again.","This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants.  The chips, salsa and the fajitas are exceptional.   We have always had good service even with a large crowd.","Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.  My husband and I shared fish tacos and they were BLAND, the menu said they came with \"special sauce\" but when they came there wasn't any sauce, we asked for it but never got it.","My friend Keri and I visited for Taco Tuesday in hopes of some excellent tacos. The salsa was mild with little to no heat, but we anticipated it with the name of the establishment. I ordered a ground beef taco that had an abundance of onions in it. I ended up not being able to consume it, since I generally do not care for onions. Tolerating a little for added flavor is one thing, but when there is more onions than beef then it becomes a issue. The server just cleared the plates without asking if something was wrong. I don't anticipate us returning in the future, there are far better Mexican eateries out there.","This is definitely Americanized Mexican food.\n\nThe good: beautiful decor, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and fast service. \n\nThe bad: not as authentic as other places, a little more expensice than other places in the area, overall a few steps above On The Border.\n\nIf you're from the Midwest and want to stay within your comfort zone, this will be the best Mexican you've ever had. If you want to experiment and try real authentic Mexican, this isnt the place. Still the staff was friendly and great atmosphere with lots of menu options","We have almost never been disappointed here and know what to expect. Most of the servers are very nice, service isn't always the fastest but as long as the food is hot when it comes out that's ok. The chips and salsa are typical if a American/Mexican restaurant and so is the food.","Exceptional service here and delicious tacos! A la carte all day long! Great price too.","The best chips and salsa I have had in Arizona.   I buy it from the restaurant for parties at my house.  I am a regular lunch patron.  You can't beat taco Tuesday.  The tacos are large and filling.  The hard taco shell stays crispy as opposed to some other places I have been where the shells have been soggy.","Not a fan.  I'm used to authentic Mexican I didn't find it here.  Moreover, the service was lackluster.  I was alone and no one greeted me for about 5 minutes.  After I was seated no one came around for another 5 minutes. The carne asada was average and I finally got a refill on my soda after I had finished my meal.  I won't be back."],"business_id":"8gzwqbiqJ6126_myoDchGw","name":"Los Gringos Locos Grill & Cantina","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Awesome food. Great place to eat. People are really friendly.","I love the smell as soon as you walk in.  Like the taste of a homemade flour tortillas? Or if you would like to find out, then this is your chance.\n\nI have never been a fan of Mexican or Tex Mex chain restaurants but Cafe Rio has definitely changed my mind and taste buds.  \n\nI highly recommend the shredded beef, pinto beans, cilantro rice, shredded cheese,pico de gallo, and enchilada style burrito topped with a little sour cream and a side salad and ahhhhh!!! Just come with patience cause the service is a hit or miss but more of a miss(hence the 4 stars) They also have house made desserts  and great drink selection. Definitely not bad for a chain restaurant!","Cafe Rio, where do I start? This place is one of the better Mexican places that one can go to. It's set up like most \"fast food\" Mexican places. You tell the person what you want, pick your meat and toppings and then pay at the end. The service is usually good and they aren't stingy with the toppings.\n\nNow for the food. Mark my words. Cafe Rio has some of the BEST Barbacoa on this earth. Whether it's in a burrito or topping a salad or nachos you can't go wrong. I've tried the fire-grilled chicken and steak and it just can't compete with the Pork. If you order a burrito you can get it enchilada style (covered in sauce) or regular. The burrito is huge and almost enough for 2 meals. The salads are definitely enough for 2 meals. Just yesterday I ate the greens out of the salad for one meal, then rolled it up into a burrito for a 2nd meal. The nachos are amazing. Loaded and nice crispy house-made chips.\n\nThese are great, but they can't even compare to the greatness that is Cafe Rio's Queso Dip. Once you have it, it is life-changing. I like to call it spackle for your insides. Once you eat it, it fills every nook and cranny in your stomach leaving you full and satisfied. It's hard to put how good it is in words.\n\nSo go to Cafe Rio. I guarantee you'll find something there that you'll love.","No! \nService was fairly rude, to begin with. Then the food was just bad. I ordered the sweet pork barbacoa and, yes, it is sweet. VERY, VERY SWEET. It tasted like meat candy. Then, on the side I got a helping of hard rice. It was probably 5-10 from being fully cooked. \nNo desire to come back here. Why do people love this place?","I have been here a few hundred times.  Well maybe more like twenty.\n\nI know cafe Rio is a chain but they make pretty tasty food fast and cheap!  I usually go or the chicken tostada.  I like it better than the salad because they use the shredded romaine lettuce.  \n\nAlso, Fideo Fridays!\n\nthe only thing I don't like is they shout \"extra ....\" if you order something extra.  It is obnoxious.  So I was like 2 can play this game...\n\nJason - \"extra meat please.\"\n\nCafe Rio Employees - \"EXTRA MEAT!\"\n\nJason - \"can I have extra a little lettuce.\"\n\nCafe Rio Employees - \"EXTRA LETTUCE!\"\n\nJason - \"Can I have extra cheese please?\"\n\nCafe Rio Employees - \"EXTRA CHEESE!\"\n\nJason - \"Can I have extra cheese chip strips?\"\n\nCafe Rio Employees - \"extra chips....\"\n\nJason - \"can I have Extra cilantro?\"\n\nCafe Rio Employees - \"extra cilan......\"  \n\nI thought it was funny.","Totally decent, fast Mexican food. \nThe salads and tacos are good, but recently I've been stuck on the chicken enchiladas. (Don't forget to order extra verde sauce to cover the rice.) The employees check in with you at regular intervals during the food prep process to make sure you want the added pico, lettuce and cheese, etc... (and you do!:))\nI've never had anything but friendly service here, but I almost always end up at Zaba's instead when I'm craving a quick Mexican treat. Cafe Rio just doesn't always taste as fresh as I would hope for. But with the frequent dining card deals and the huge portions there's no denying it's filling food at a good price.","Only 3 stars because the cashier was rude and argumentative. I do not like it when the service forgets who the customer is, and that I have a choice where I spend my money. The food was excellent,and the service up until the cashier was perfect. This was the second time that this same lady was rude, the management should not have her communicating with customers. The bathrooms were dirty, and the floors needed mopped... that's where she belonged.","The food is ok at best. Personally I think it's a bit over priced for Mexican food since there's better options if you're looking for Mexican fast food in Vegas.","What can i say some top of the line Mexican fast food. I love Mexican food and this was a good place. Everything here looks pretty good. But the best was the barbacoa pork and i also enjoying the Mexican style spaghetti. I'll definitely be back","This place gives you BIG portions and it will fill you up for the day (if you eat this between lunch and dinner).  I recommend the Pork Barbacoa (it is sweet.... they use Coca Cola in the recipe)  The salads are so wonderful with the creamy tomatillo dressing.  My husband loves the enchilada style chicken burrito.  It may be a little pricier than other burrito joints, but it's healthier and worth it!","One of my favorite lunch spots! I love how they have different specials everyday, especially the coconut shrimp tacos on tuesdays, one of my favorites! The staff has always been super friendly, food pretty awesomely good and has always been a great experience. I've even turned a few people on to it!","Went here for lunch with a friend.  I ordered the Nachos with no meat.  It was a pretty large serving and came topped with Cheese, Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Salsa, Rice.\n\nI was surprised that they put rice on their Nachos.  I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.\n\nMy friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.\n\nOne cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.\n\nWill I return?  At some point, probably....but it's not my 1st or 2nd choice.","Love the BBQ pork on the tostada. If I'm really hungry I'll get the salad. The salad dressings are tasty. Fast service. Get a frequent dining card.","I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The employees are very friendly and created a fun atmosphere.  And, the food is good, too!  I hope we get a Cafe Rio in our part of Southern California soon.","At a dental office next door to this place, was super hungry so i went a cross while wating for my GF, and was surprised with the quality of food here and the taste, i would call this place an Upgraded version of Chipotle, I loved it. Same concept, fresher and more options than chipotle including fish... great Salads with amazing dressings, they give you a lot of food and are not stingy with the portions. \nI just found out that there is one in Tustin right by my house as well. I am sure they are going to be popping up everywhere pretty soon, so if i were you i would try this place out, amazing taste, friendly staff, super fresh...\n\nMy new go to place over chipotle for sure!","I liked this place. They are very fast and the food is fresh. I enjoyed watching the lady making the tortillas. We ordered nachos and 2 cheese enchiladas. They were both very good. The atmosphere is fun and chill. Something that did make me sick a little bit was that they didn't have soap in the bathroom and I was wondering if employees use the same bathroom..... iickkkk","Been meaning to try this place for a while, we'll definitely return.  Their hottest sauce not very hot but with the variety of bottled sauces they make available to you makes up for it.  I'm a big fan of queso and chips and this place does have fresh yummy chips and their queso was very good, a bit salty but good.","very tasty ... tasted gourmetish ( make up words) ... for only 9$ it kept me fed for lunch as well as dinner","Cafe Rio has quickly become my favorite place to eat out. The food is great, and the atmosphere is great for families, couples, or groups! Plus, they have Apple Beer!","I had the fire grilled steak tostada and it was pretty good. It could have had some more steak though. It was fully loaded and the flavors were great.","As far as fast food Mexican joints go, Cafe Rio is pretty good. Portions are very generous, and I like that their tortillas are made freshly throughout the day.\n\nHaven't tried other offerings yet, because we almost always go for the burritos. Skip the boring chicken and go for the Pork Barbacoa or the Chile Roasted Beef. They're both very tasty options. Also, enchilada style(AKA wet burrito) is the way to go, topped with salsa verde and cheese. Drink selections there are plentiful too.\n\nBeware of other extras and add-ons though, or you could end up with a pricey meal!\nIf you just HAVE TO get your sour cream, pico, or their addicting house dressing,(AKA Salsa Verde mixed with Ranch) they are big enough to share. Will probably try one of their huge salads next time if I can get myself to take a break from their burritos!....ALOHA!!!","Came here a few months back and thought to try again after pretty bad customer service.  we stood in the line with no one ahead of us while two employees carried on with their  conversation.  Food was good but service left me a bad taste for this restaurant.","I LOVE this place. I've been here 3 times. I'm not from this state of its not that often I can eat here. The food is delicious and the portions are large. The staff is really friendly and helpful. I can eat here everyday. :)","Like the taste of a homemade flour tortillas? Or if you want to know, then this is your chance. I love the smell as soon as you walk in and I highly recommend the shredded beef, pinto beans, cilantro rice, shredded cheese,pico de gallo, and enchilada style burrito topped with a little sour cream and a side salad and ahhhhh!!! Just come with patience cause the service is a hit or miss but more of a miss(hence the 4 stars) They also have house made desserts which i have yet to try. Definitely not bad for a chain restaurant!","The standard chain burrito joint, that lacks flavor and is way overpriced. The burritos are very wet, meaning by the time you eat half of it, the other half will fall apart so ask for a fork.","Tried this place for the first time. I am a big Chipotle fan, and will probably remain a Chipotle fan. This place was pretty good, just not as good as others. The enchilada style is kind of cool, but this place is trying to gain a buck around every corner. Their burritos are expensive as it is, then they add extra for things like sour cream or making it enchilada style and the drinks are pricey as well. The steak was burnt, but the pork was sweet and very tasty. The tortilla's are sub par compared to Chipotle's as well. The rice isn't as tasty either. You might be thinking, why did they get a four then. Well the food was good enough and plenty enough. The service was fine, not much they could do for fast food mexican restraunt. They had a lot of choices for your drink. Lots of interesting teas, lemonade, and all your standard sodas.","Let me just start out by saying I am not a big pork fan, but Cafe Rio's sweet pork barbacoa burrito is TO DIE FOR!  I could eat this everyday and not get tired of it.\nI've even tried to find yucatan-style pork recipes in the attempt to duplicate this at home and it's been a \"bust\" so far....\n\nNot too crazy about their chips; I prefer the lighter color, no cornmeal type, but I DO love their homemade tortillas and often order extras to take home. \n\nAlso love their mint limeade drink; will definitely try to duplicate that at home since I have lots of mint growing in the yard!\n\nBetween Baja Fresh and Cafe Rio; it's a \"toss\" as to which one is my favorite.","CHILE ROASTED BEEF BURRITO, ENCHILADA STYLE WITH CHEESE, GUAC, SOUR CREAM AND PICO ON SIDE!! yumm..\n\ni can eat at this place everyday if I wanted to.. but I can't because I will get way too fat way too quick since I can inhale that entire burrito in one sitting.. no lie!!!\n\nfood tastes great, the prices are reasonable. call ahead and place order or go online during lunch time, it gets busy!!!","Good place to pick up some fresh Mexican food. We ordered a barbacoa burrito, steak quesadilla, and chicken quesadilla.  As far as the burrito is concerned, I would say it's slightly smaller than a Chipotle burrito, but better tasting. Overall everything tasted good and was fresh. I would definitely return here again.","not a bad option for fast mexicanish food its got the ish because you know someone grandma didnt make it....lol anyway we ordered a large helping of nachos and and 2 cheese enchilada they all were good and the staff was helpful and the restaurant was clean !!","Their food is OK but the employees are a bunch of idiots and rude people. They don't ask for what you want and they get bitchy if ask for anything like salsa for your tacos! We won't be coming back here ever. They need a manager.","Been there a bunch of times and can say decent food crappy attitude until today now even the food is bad. Poor prep employees just don't care. Time for a new manager.","As far as fast food slash quick Mexican food goes this is pretty good. Queso with chips is always yummy. I enjoy the salad with tortilla on the side. My son always gets the pork barbosa. Top it off with the mint lemon aid.","Although food is good customer service is terrible they always ask what you have they constantly mess up orders they don't listen and they play around too much. Been here over 12 times because it's the closest to my house but man i will be going to the centennial one because they actually pay attention to the order and the customer.","Still some great food but the proportions are getting smaller. They seem to be giving less esp on the meat.","Still over rated.\n\nCafe Rio is a crumby version of all of your local Hispanic and South American foods, crammed into one bland menu.\n\nI was asked to stop here on my way to an event. Upon trying to order for a couple people, I learned that there is no flexibility in the items. You can take what they offer in only certain arrangements, otherwise, everything is full price and cannot be made with other toppings. \n\nThey got the order wrong twice, then looked at me like I had 3 heads and a tail when I told them that I did not want chips, beans, and rice with the meal. \n\nAll that stress for drastically over priced, low quality food.\nTotally not worth is.\n\nNear ANY Cafe Rio in town, you will find a Roberto's or other spot for tacos, burritos and nachos... so skip this garbage and at least go to a place where the staff is friendly and helpful.","We decided to try this place out after shopping at Costco.  The staff was friendly enough.  I got beef and pork tacos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  The food is very good for fast food.  I just wish that they had some mild sauces because not everyone likes hot sauce and burn your ass sauce.  Also, the counter is too high.  Little people like me can't see what's going on with our food! :)","Eh, I love & hate you CR...\nRight now, I hate you! Tryed your online ordering for the first time and probably the last time. When I got there I went to the p/u line. You guys didn't even have my order online? Hmmm, lady at counter said it takes 15 minutes to come up after you order? Not cool but what ever. I've been charged for it already so I'll wait. Tick * Tock * 15 minutes pass, I get up and walk back over to the lady to see if it is up, it is. Woo-who! So she said they'll start to make it. Alright, cool. Took 35 more minutes!? Oh come on now, I just got off work, all I want is my damn cheese enchiladas and my chips & guac!\nI know you guys get extremely busy but there was no reason for my order to take that long! Geez","Get the burritos enchilada style for that extra cheese and red sauce. The burritos themselves are very fat and filling! I recommend the sweet barbacoa pork, it's different from traditional barbacoa but it's still delicious.","This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but nothing good lasts forever. The manager is a joke, I asked if they weren't going to have any mint limeade, the best part of Cafe Rio and he apologized and said there was no excuse. That's it? No we'll make more, nothing. The place has gone down hill and the manager is the reason. Food quality and service quality are just terrible.","My husband and I love cafe rio. I've been to almost all of them in Utah but this cafe rio in particular isn't up to par with the other ones. The rice is usually overlooked or undercooked. No one there knows the proper way to present the tres leches by flipping on a small plate adding whipped cream and sliced strawberries. They just hand it to you in one of the tin containers with a plastic top. I even told them they didn't make it right and they had no idea what I was talking about. Anyway that's my rant.","This place is disgusting! I guess the inmates run the joint because it was filthy, disorganized and the service is non-existent!!!\nwouldn't go back if they were giving this crap away.","The food isn't bad, but it could be a whole lot better.

{"reviews":["This place was a wannabe, lower quality, Chipotle restaurant.  Lower quality, meats NOT made to order, too pricey for the quality.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos and when they went to put the fish inside the tacos I noticed that the food was NOT made to order. My fish was in a warming container- as was all the meat. Ew! I was worried that my fish was hours old and I'd get food poisoning. \n\n$$$ I thought the price was too high for the quality. If I'm going to spend $15 and only drink water the food needs to be better quality.  \n\nThe positive: they had several kinds of unique salsa (mango salsa was good). \n\nSkip it-- go to Chipolte, Baja Fresh or Rubios.","Good for a quick and easy meal.  It's a lot like Chipotle.  Although it's pretty good, I still think Chipotle is better.  The service was great.","After my great massage @ Vita Bella, I asked where a great place to eat was. I was directed to Cafe Rumba and told to get the nachos! Yum!! I like the hot green sauce with mine. Now every time I get my massage I hop over to Cafe Rumba for my nachos! Life is good!","Sorry folks!  Not the best value nor food.  We typically split a Chipotle bowl w/xtra meat and walk out stuffed! And never pay more that $10 bucks w/soda and all the tortillas you want! This cost us $15 w/water only and left us very unsatisfied. Blah is best description!","Good Food. I have been meaning to try this place and I can say that I am not disappointed. I ordered the veggie burrito. Very delicious. The chips and salsa where also good. It reminded me of a cross between Bajio and Chipotle. Prices are comparable. Will go again!","Always fresh, always good.  \n\nYour order is made as you go through the line, the  service is good and you can not judge this place by the size of the crowd.  Sometimes it is packed  upon arrival, other times there is no problem finding a place to sit and enjoy the meal.\n\nAgain, always fresh, always good.","Pretty similar to Chipotle/Qdoba in terms of price and selection (maybe a little cheaper).  Went there on a lunch break and the place was packed.  As far as the food goes, let me say this:  Chipotle, you have been pwned.  Seriously.  The food here is way better.  The burritos aren't quite as big, but they taste awesome. Go for the Rumba Burrito and you can't go wrong.  \n\nStaff always seems super friendly, they tend to remember regulars.","I've eaten at a lot of small cafe/mexican food places like this including Chipotle, Qdoba, Baja Fresh and other small hole-in-the-wall places.  This is one of my favorites because they have some of the most tender meats that they pull/shred there in front of you.  I love the location there on corner of 59th & Union Hills.  Very convenient!","A very nice surprise. My parents gave me a coupon from an entertainment book to try this place and was amazed at how good the food was. I probably would have never stop in if it wasnt for the coupon but glad I did. I had a Chicken burrito and it was great. Thanks Rumba we will be back","Great price and very nice for a quick bite! Chips, salsa, quesadillas, and burritos are delicious. Small atmosphere but clean.","you have GOT to try this place!!   hands down the best mango salsa of your LIFE!!   i always get the tropical pork tacos, flour tortilla, with mango salsa, lettuce, cilantro, and baja sauce.  seriously, a fiesta in your mouth.   chips and salsa come on the side, but they aren't that great and often way to salty.   regardless, i still eat here about 1-2 times a week!!   They are a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it.  as a med student at Midwestern University up the street, it's the place to go for lunch, and they give a student discount (just what i'm looking for!!).   I'm not a huge fan of their burritos, but they are about as big as your head and super filling.  my complaint is that they are watery and often fall apart, but the taste is phenomenal!  I've tried all of the meats on selection there and the pork is by far the best!   however, all of them are good and taste extremely fresh and succulent.   seriously eat here and you won't regret it, it's unique and unlike any other burrito shop you'll find in west valley/glendale.","I stumbled on this place a couple months back after running some lunchtime errands, and was soon coming back with reinforcements....\n\nIt reminds me of a cross between Chipotle and Bajio, The overall presentation seems a little more authentic, if that makes sense.  The small burrito lunch special is a good deal, but I have grown to love the (slightly more expensive) Tropical tacos.  The mango salsa is addicting, and the excess that falls off can always be scooped up with the included chips.  \n\nOn that note, of variety of meals we got (burritos, tacos, quesadillas) they all seems to fall apart at some point.  Not a huge deal, your burrito just becomes sort of a rice bowl halfway through.  Make sure you grab a few extra napkins!","My roommate and I discovered this treasure on accident, but are so happy that we did. This is my favorite burrito place in AZ. I have only ordered the chicken burrito, but would eat it every day if I could live healthy off of just that. I have no reason to even try any of their other items because I am in love. So is my roomie. Cafe Rumba simply outflavors any other southwest/mexican restaurant I have tried out here, and believe me, Burrito Tuesday every week adds up to a lot of places! The roomie and I both reccomend this place to EVERYONE, though we can only speak for the chicken burrito and chips and salsa. Nevertheless, we are in love with Cafe Rumba and wish there were many around the valley.","Very nice staff, excellent food, awesome prices","This is one of my favorite healthy mexican restaurants.  I love it as much as Chipotle.  \n\nI try to eat healthy, and Cafe Rumba's tropical salad is one of the healthiest and yet delicious items on the menu.  \n\nThey do get busy during lunch due to folks from the university and Honeywell, and sometimes in the evenings there can be long lines as well.  \n\nI try to go there to eat once per week, since the food is so healthy and delicious, and of course affordable.","Closed Sundays, and seem to close early at night.  Located on the NW corner of Union Hills & 59th ave..  Food is prepared like Subway, right in front of you, but it can be challenging because the person who starts the line doesn't always speak English.  They're fine if you just say the order terminology and step aside but if you ask a question then they have to get somene else.  For no apparent reason the middle-aged overweight guy who takes the money was rude to me for asking a simple question.  This is retail, and I'm sorry you work the register, but there was no reason to be rude.\n\nFood was comparable to other fast food places like Chipotle that are a notch up from taco bell and such.  Prices are a little high but the portion is large, and it comes with a side of those little churro-like straws.  Competition down the road makes this a tough option - Dos Amigos, Rubios, and more.  Seems to be a favorite of folks wearing scrubs!","I enjoyed the food from this place.  As people have mentioned, it is kind of a standard walk through burrito joint..  Food was fresh and tasty.  Very filling..  I'd go back.","Cafe Rumba/Bajio/Chipotle/ etc\n\nThey are all about the same type of place. Menu on the wall, lunch counter style ordering, throw everything in a burrito. \n\nI have to say it was good. I had the small burrito with shredded beef, chipolte bbq sauce, beans, cheese and sour cream. Served with chips and salsa and little cinnamon frys and  a drink. \n\nThe burrito was big enough without being too big, had good flavor and the tortilla was fresh tasting. The chips were salty and the salsa was glorified tomato sauce. LOL I guess I could have asked for a hotter one. \n\nThe place was clean and the staff was nice. I have a BOGO coupon from the entertainment book. I will be sure to use it.","Excellent food at a fair price and far better than the chains of the same vein. A nice family owned business welcomed in a growing neighborhood. Perfect if you're across the street at Honeywell or Midwestern U, but easy to get to since it's a mile south of the north valley 101. Get a Rumba Burrito with pork, your choice of fixings and hot green salsa. You won't regret it. You can even grab a cold beer to wash it down.","I got the quesadilla with shrimp and mango. Unique combination, but nonetheless good. Try it.\n\nI'd recommend this place. I was only in Glendale for one day because I was interviewing at Midwestern University. I just decided to stop somewhere for dinner the night before the interview. I saw this place and hoped it was good--and it was.\n\nI kinda wanted to try a regular burrito but someone else on Yelp said to try the Shrimp+Mango Quesadilla, so that's what I did.\n\nThe place was kinda empty during dinner time... I don't really know what that means, but it doesn't seem good.","Café Rumba was one of my regular lunch spots until my office moved to Peoria, I do miss eating here.  It's tucked back in the corner of the lot which can make it difficult to find, but it appears that many of the locals have found it. \n\nThe food is fresh and prepared right in front of you ala Chipotle, but tastier than Chipotle.  They have several types of salsa which compliment the light and crispy chips nicely. My favorites were the chicken burrito, fish tacos (darn good with the white sauce on them), and the quesadilla with green chilies.  \nThe staff is friendly and helpful, it is as if they enjoy working there, imagine that. \nI hope this place makes it.","I really like Cafe Rumba. The lunch special Rumba Burrito, Drink and Rumba Fries is a good value. I love the the Peach-Mango Salsa and the spicy sour cream. \nThey do tend to close early at night so I usually go there for a late lunch. They are too busy at lunch time so I just go later. \nWhat happened to the discount coupons in the Super Savings Magazine? I miss using those coupons! I do appreciate having the punch card for customer loyalty where your 10th item is free!","Not bad. Not super amazing. My cafe rumba burrito was okay, line was moving a little slow but the employees were nice.","Definitely my preferred quick Mexican food place! Obsessed! I love this place! The shredded beef burrito is filling and delicious! The fresh salsa is amazing! The only bad thing is they aren't open on Sundays and that's usually when I want it!! :)","I'm looking at the other reviews for Cafe Rhumba and I can't believe we all ate at the same restaurant. We found it to be very bland and boring. There is no way this restaurant compares to Chipotle in any way. There were 4 of us and we all had something different as none of us had ever been there before. All 4 meals were tasteless. The salsa had no taste, the chicken was not seasoned, etc. We will NEVER go back again. I could eat at Chipotle weekly and was happy to have another similar restaurant. What a shock to find it to be so bad.","Get the nachos....they're awesome...good salsa selection too","I have been a big fan of Cafe Rhumba since my first visit. This is a great example of a restaurant with a somewhat limited menu - but consistent taste and quality across the board. I've tried a variety of different items and have never been disappointed. \n\nIf you are a newbie, here are three suggestions to start:\n\n1. The Rhumba Burrito: \nCan't go wrong here. It's the signature pork, chicken or steak on a flour tortilla where you choose the fixin's. The pork is a personal favorite, it's always moist (unlike a lot of those other burrito places) and flavorful. The ingredients are fresh and served just the way  you like them. Be sure to try the tomatillo salsa. If you're looking for something different, ask for a side of \"Baja Sauce\" a ranchy-style light jalepeno dressing for a little kick. It's not football-sized but it's pretty big and filling for most. \n\n2. The Rhumba BBQ Chicken Pizza:\nUnless you have a big appetite, this pizza serves two. It's basically two cheese crisps, filled with fresh shredded chicken, onions, cilantro and tomatoes and a rich and spicy Chipotle BBQ sauce. It's just a little spicy without being overpowering. Great flavors all around. Just like regular pizza, it also tastes great the next day, so if you can't finish it, just take it home!\n\n3. The Rhumba Salad:\nA fresh flour tortilla holds a bed of fresh greens and your choice of pork, chicken or beef. I usually add rice, corn, pico along with the cheese and tortilla strips. For dressing, I like the roasted tomatillo to really bring out the flavor of the meat without overpowering it. Plus, when you're done, you can eat the bowl. Well, you can eat the fresh tortilla anyway. It's a big salad but you'll be surprised at how fast you devour it. I am not a salad guy by any means but I love this salad - and I can eat a little more than usual because it's pretty healthy. \n\nAlcohol is available or you can go with an assortment of bottled or fountain drinks. \n\nFor us, the service is always great, with a little interaction with the staff who is creating your meal to order. The atmosphere isn't fancy but it is definitely family friendly, so feel free to bring the kids. If it's cool, grab a bite on the outdoor patio or dine inside. Your call. \n\nIt's not really fast food but like the saying goes, more \"good food served quickly\". I think another reviewer's description of something between Chipotle and Bajio is right on. If you're thinking of giving Cafe Rhumba a try, go for lunch and get the lunch special - usually a small Rhumba burrito, drink and \"rhumba fries\" which are deep fried tortilla crisps coated in cinnamon sugar. It's a nice sized meal to get you through the day without needing a nap afterward. And the combo price is always nice.\n\nIf you're tired of chains and looking for a place that serves fresh food daily in a few flavorful combinations, visit Cafe Rhumba. You'll be glad you did!","Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.","Can't believe the positive reviews! This place was awful. Bland watery chicken, salsa had no flavor, even the mango salsa. It just tasted like pieces of mango. The staff was neither here nor there. They seemed a little tired actually. I found it funny that the menu had descriptions but they ask you what you want as they make it. Don't waste your time here, go to Chipotle, Baja Loco, heck even Rubios. Seriously don't bother unless you like to eat soggy cardboard.","Went here for lunch on the suggestion of someone who raved about this place. It is essentially like a Qdoba (do they have those here?), and in my opinion, Qdoba is MUCH better. This place was, how do I say it? ew. I had a fish taco, and I didn't even finish it. Bland, watery fish. Even the mango salsa was no good. I have no desire to return here.","I don't know how anyone could hate this place!  LOVE the food!  I always get the two tacos with either chicken or pork, pineapple salsa...and mango salsa.  The mango salsa is to die for!!!  YUMMMMM!","We're regulars here because Baja Mexican food is not as heavy as traditional Mexican food. They have wonder Chicken, Pork, Steak and Shrimp marinated in a  clear broth. Wonderful fresh veggies & their guacamole is delicious. Oh yeah,  and whole wheat tortillas...","We stopped in here had the Rumba burrito, food didn't have much flavor chips were not very good.  Salsa was bland. You can get much better elsewhere. One server really didn't want to be there was complaining about being told to wash the door, didn't make for a good experience. We wont be back.","Love, love, love this place! My favorite is the Rumba Nacho's and my Husband loves the Rumba Burrito. Always fresh and made right in front of you. Don't understand the negative reviews. They have a great menu and lots to choose from. Just wish they didn't take the fried ice cream off the menu! 5 stars from me!","Not really impressed.  I spent nearly $10 for two tacos, rice beans and a drink.  The tacos were okay, kind of bland actually.  For the money I feel like I could do better elsewhere.","I like this place a lot.  It is relatively cheap and even cheaper with the student discount.  The mango shrimp quesadilla is really good, and I would definitely recommend it.  The restaurant is clean, which is a plus.  The server is nice, which is another plus.  So, overall, i would recommend this place definitely.","I really adore this place mostly for their lunch special, and their guac is a particular favorite of mine since it's how my mom always makes it =)\nTheir portions are always large so you really get your money's worth.  Sometimes the food can be a little bland, but I feel like that's more a failing on my part for not putting the right salsa on whatever I'm getting.\n\nTheir sweet green salsa and mango salsa are particular favorites of mine, and I'm happy to keep going back to a local business.","I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.\n\nIts not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?\n\nAs stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. \"I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes\". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them. \n\nFOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure.","My wife wanted to try Cafe Rumba again so off we went along with our friend Kathy R. Kathy got the shredded beef burrito. She told Carol & I the place reminded her of Chipotle only better. My wife Carol got the pork burrito beans, cheese and sour cream. I ended up getting the same dinner as she did. The burrito was served with chips and mango salsa and a drink. \n\nI must admit I enjoyed it much better than the beef we had there on our first visit. In fact that is why I gave it a higher rating than on my last visit. \n\nI didn't realize they also had a selection of several different kinds of salsa. So I tried the pineapple salsa and two others. They really added to the over all flavor of the food. \n\nFOOD: Very fulfilling - fast and efficient. The three questions I ask myself after a meal... a) Am I full?  check`b) Did the food taste good? check c) Was it worth the price I paid? check PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! The three questions I ask myself after a meal...a) Am I full?  check b) Did the food taste good? check c) Was it worth the price I paid? check. Another nice thing is that when you dine in they have complimentary chips to accompany your meal. SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Their portions are always large so you really get your money's worth.","Beef rumba salad is light, refreshing and somewhat healthy. Dressing optional as it's so tasty with salsa only. Oh! and don't forget to squeeze lime on it.\nFlavors are great, serving size is a bit small for the price paid. Seems a small salad like this one shouldn't be close to $7.00, I'd think more around $5.00. \nAmbience is sort of beachy if you use your imagination.","Most of the staff have been working at CR for years which is a reflection of their passion and dedication to the company and food. Because the staff know what they're doing, the food is extremely high quality, consistent, and authentic. The staff is friendly as well and works to get the line down as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality or presentation of the food. \n\nThe environment of the restaurant is unique and comfortable with high ceilings and bright colors. Indoor and outdoor seating is available.\n\nThe food brings an authentic baja style taste. The enchiladas are my personal favorite by far. Corn tortillas, cheese, one or one of each of their delicious meats, red or green sauce, rice, and refried or black beans. I always add green chilies on top for a little extra kick and a little extra $. I also add sour cream and fresh green onions with a side of their delicious baja sauce and either their mild or hot salsa. All of the other menu items are delicious, fresh, and authentic as well. Thanks CR! \n\nOverall, CR is an extremely authentic, consistent, and delicious local restaurant that is well worth the price. Ask for a stamp card!\n\nA friendly note: if you want Chipotle, go to Chipotle. If you want local, go to Cafe Rumba!","I love the bean and cheese burritos here (I add corn and pico inside), it's around $4. The majority of their food runs around $7-8. Their tortillas here are just so good, they are seriously to die for.  If they sold their tortillas by the bulk I'd buy them. I personally don't really like the meat burritos, the plain bean and cheese is definitely the best (that's the only thing my entire family gets). My mom enjoys their fish tacos though. I used to come one to two times a week, but unfortunately I don't live close to here anymore and have to take special trips just to grab one of their burritos. You should open a location in Scottsdale!","I need tacos in my life and Cafe Rumba fills that need and makes me happy.  The meats are marinated nicely, the salsas are light and fresh, the barbecue sauce I get on chicken and pork tacos are divine.  They have an awesome lunch special too.  I highly recommend.","Did I just pay $10.43 for that?! The soda is good. They barely give you cheese or sour cream on your burro.","This is the best bang for your buck in the valley.   I recommend getting the Rumba burrito with shredded beef, green chilies, black beans, lettuce, cabbage and spicy green salsa.  The owners and staff are very friendly.  Similar to Chipotle but their meat is much better and so is there salsa."],"business_id":"Agz-gMJfjCsK5tdKC6FBYQ","name":"Cafe Rumba","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Used to be Casa de Lara years ago to which I was not a fan.   Heard that Casa Del Sol was much better and so I finally got a chance to try them again.   \nI ordered take out for three dishes to get an idea of what they were like.   For carry out Mexican food I was quite pleased.  \nThe restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful showing a real concern for getting me my food quickly.   When we got it home it was all that we had hoped for.  Well made, good flavors, acceptable portions.\nI would have liked a larger portion on the beans and rice but no big deal.\nThe food was good but didn't WOW me.  Thus one less star from 5.\nI will definitely go back.","Sometimes You Can't Return Home\n\nYears ago, I used to frequent Casa Del Sol on a regular basis when there were far fewer options for Mexican food.  It was relatively inexpensive, the food was decent and the kid's menu provided options for the finicky eaters.   When my wife and I were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch, we decided to take a trip down memory lane and revisit Casa Del Sol.  Let's just say that it may be another ten years until we return for our next visit...\n\nService ran hot and cold during my recent visit.  There was no one to greet me when I entered the restaurant...  It wasn't a big deal, since it gave a chance to peruse the menu while waiting for my dining companion to arrive.  We were seated by an energetic server, but it was the stoner server (see Heather C's review) who took our order.  He was exceptionally mellow this day and spoke in a whispered tone, so I had to repeatedly ask him to repeat what he was saying.  It was Comedy Gold, but the novelty wore off by the end of the meal.  To his credit, he kept the chip basket full and checked in periodically to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.\n\nThe food was more miss than hit.  I did enjoy the chips.  While not freshly made, they were warm, well seasoned and not greasy.  The salsa / tomato puree was bland, so I asked for some hotter salsa.  Big mistake - what we got was vile, grainy mixture of vegetable oil and chili powder.  To their credit, it was spicy.  So spicy that it completely blew out my palette for the first half of the meal.\n\nThe chili verde was an impressive entrée.  The pork was tender, the green chili added a dollop of heat and the onions and cilantro completed the dish.  The sides were a letdown, the rice was over-cooked and the refried beans had that fresh out of the can feeling.  If you find yourself staring that the Casa Del Sol menu awaiting culinary inspiration, just order the chili verde and don't look back.\n\nMy wife did not fare as well with her chicken fajitas.  The meat was dry and chewy from being overcooked and lacked any hint of seasoning.  The vegetables were mushy from being over-cooked and swimming in a pool of oil. \n\nThe fried ice cream was also a flawed dish.  The coating lacked any crunch at all.  It was as if someone poured a bowl of corn flakes and milk, let it sit overnight and then pressed the resulting mush over a ball of ice cream. Total train wreck.  Also absent was any nutmeg or cinnamon.  The ice cream was of poor quality, heavy on the ice, light on the cream.  I did enjoy the fried tortilla at the bottom of the dish, lightly dusted with sugar and cinnamon using it to scoop up the honey and whipped creams served with this dessert.\n\nDespite the thoroughly satisfying chile verde, I don't think I'll be beating a path back too Casa Del Sol.  The kitchen is just too inconsistent and there are much better options for Mexican food in Madison.","Good place, not great. Atmosphere was more casual than classy or sensual. Margaritas were ok, not too strong if your looking for that. Did have the badger game on and the server was friendly, probably the only pluses.","Love this place. I have never had a bad meal. Fajitas great. Enchiladas\nrock. Carne Asada is out of this world. They catered a meal for 20 in January and we got tons of high fives. Wait staff is superb friendly ask for Miguel. We NEVER go to Laredos anymore with Casa in our backyard. Prices are reasonable as well. Juan runs a great operation.","I love Mexican which means I can be very picky about my Mexican food.  Casa del Sol did not disappoint.  Immediately we were served chips and salsa.  I was a big fan of the salsa, not a fan of the spicy carrots (?) and jalapenos that were put on the chips...too much hot for my liking.  I ordered a banana margarita and the three people I was with ordered margaritas as well along with waters.  It did take a while for us to get the waters, and even longer to get the margaritas, but they did fill up the waters quickly when we finished them.  I ordered the enchiladas chile poblano.  LOVED THEM.  They used real cheese, and lots of it, and the sauce was excellent.  I wish there was more of it.  The mexican rice that came as a side was also delicious.  My one complaint about the enchiladas was the the bottom of the tortillas were very tough and chewy, but overall, I would order those again.  All in all, I thought the prices were reasonable, the food excellent and the service average.","One star for the clean facility and friendly staff. A half for nostalgia, for food that takes me back to my youth, when gringo Mexican food was all there was in these parts, and it was oh-so-good. Yelp and its fine community of Yelpers is forgiving, so the half rounds up and two stars seems about right for this fun, festive joint that unlike some other nearby places in the area, does not scrimp on and/or charge for chips and salsa (I'm talking to you Pasqual's). There is better food not far away -- El Pastor, Guadalajara, La Mestiza, Los Gemelos -- but Casa del Sol is better for families with its nice kids' menu, and that's why we were here.","This place (and their sister restaurant, Casa de Lara-on State St), is the very best Mexican food Madison has to offer. Forget the  Pedro's and Laredo's nonsense. This place is FAB!\n\nTheir chips are thin, crispy, and excellently seasoned. Their salsa, fresh with just a little kick. With each basket of chips they serve pickled carrots--which are absolutely delicious. \n\nMy favorite dish is the Enchiladas Verdes- it's great with chicken or beef, but I usually get beef. The verde sauce is actually spicy! Most restaurant food in the Midwest doesn't deliver when they promise spice, but this place does. Take those little chili pepper icons on the menu seriously. \n\nBoth my brother as well as my boyfriend really enjoy their Torta, a type of pulled pork sandwich. It's inexpensive and was a staple when we'd dine out in college. Now that we're older and can afford more elaborate menu items, we still enjoy this simple dish. You get the option of ordering it with rice and beans or fries. Please choose the rice and beans! Their rice tastes freshly prepared and seasoned--NOT like the Mexican rice-a-roni crap served at some places. And, I'm sure they must use some good fat in their re-fried beans, because they taste like heaven.\n\nWhen we went recently for my boyfriends birthday, a sexy waiter who looked like Antonio Banderas recommended the daily special. He offered to give our order to us for free if we didn't love it. He checked back several times during the meal to make sure we were happy with our choice, and seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction. While I prefer my usual order, the special, some homemade beef soup and burrito, were also excellent. \n\nI can't even count how many times I've gone to Casa de Lara on State St., but I've been to Casa del Sol about 4 times now, and I will keep coming back as long as they're around!","This place has some seriously amazing Mexican food. Folks... Mexican in my book does not usually equal \"five stars,\" so listen up.\n\nCasa del Sol has your classics (enchilada, fajita, tamale) plus some more \"gourmet\" style dishes that mix it up with unusual ingredients. Everything we tried was fabulously fresh and flavorful... the trifecta of \"F\" adjectives.\n\nWe tried the \"burrito tropical\" with pork (mango, pineapple, and Caribbean spices integrated with more typical burrito ingredients) and the \"Playa del Carmen\" fish enchiladas and highly recommend both. Everything was served at just the right temperature, salt level, etc. The meat (and all the other ingredients for that matter) seemed to be good quality, which is rarer than it should be. Even the rice and beans on the side were tasty.\n\nOur server was really, really, incredibly enthusiastic. It was odd to me that someone was so excited to be at work on a Monday night, but what the heck, I'll take it.","I've been there many times and they are always very good. When you go out to eat with five people ordering five different things, usually one is not happy with their meal. This is not the case at Casa del Sol. The staff is great, the food doesn't take long and the price isn't bad either.","My favorite for Mexican in the Madison area, especially in the summer when you can sit outside on the deck. I've never had a bad meal here, and whatever the \"special of the day\" is- order it. It's usually very good.","The seating in the dining area is pretty bare.  Service was very fast, even had we not been occupied with the chips and salsa.\n\nI get the same thing pretty much every Mexican place I go to (name that Johnny Depp movie) - enchiladas - and these were a cut above.  Meats were juicy without being runny or greasy.","I came here for the first time in a few years for work lunch.  The place was pretty quiet inside - though the outside tables were full.\n\nThe service was quick and pleasant.  I opted for the verde pork chili.  It was really good though, not as spicy as I had hoped.  The serving was generous - more than ample for one lunch, brought the back home for left overs.\n\nWhile it was pretty quiet for us, I have been here before when it was quite busy and loud.  That's partly the nature of the place - lots of hard surfaces, bare walls, etc.  And, yes, when they are busy, there is a lot of rushing of servers around, etc...","The food was very good. I was rather impressed by the large portions and fast service for food.  Our waiter was not very attentive but I think this was partially based on the fact that we were dining in the bar area. \n\nHowever, we went here for the margaritas and I was not that impressed.  Not terrible but not amazing. \n\nGreat venue for a large party!","I didn't go in with super high expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. The manager went above and beyond for us. We were treated very well and our food/margaritas completely hit the  spot. Bueno.","I stopped in here yesterday for a quick lunch.  I dine here at least once every couple of months.  Always great service, good specials, and tasty food.","Cinco de Mayo at Casa Del Sol 2013. Waiting for a deck seat for an hour while waiting 30 minutes in between drinks? Not fun. Waiting for our cheese fondue which tasted more like a bowl of melted leftover cheese which was overpriced another 30 minutes - awesome fun. Our food? Boring. The vegetable fajitas I got was almost all onions and cactus. It was not good. The waiter was awful. I don't know if he just was having an off day but based on him standing in the bathroom texting or doing something standing in the stall - guessing he didn't take his job too seriously. A restaurant shouldn't be a 3 hour experience, especially when the ONLY customers were just in the patio seating except a FEW sparse people inside. We've gone there a couple times before and I'd rate it 3/5 for those experiences but this one is a solid -6/5. You know that feeling when you're so concerned the waiter won't come back that you want to shove them your credit card just so you won't have to wait another 30 minutes? Yes - that bad.","Casa Del Sol serves up pretty good Mexican grub. It's not the most authentic joint but that can have its advantages. By this I mean a bigger menu, bigger portions, tons of cheese, and most importantly good drinks. They also have a great kids menu. For instance: You want to go out for Mexican and your younger children don't want to. No worries! They can get chicken strips or macaroni and cheese here. What a smart idea. Not something you will find at some of the more authentic joints in town.","Not the worst, but for sure not the best.\n\nIt is what I like to call American Mexican food. \n\nIf your looking for authentic, this is not the place. If your looking for a large portion of beans and rice with still tasty food, this is where I would come. I'm not saying this is horrible food, I'm just saying that when I'm craving Mexican, I'm for sure not coming here.\n\nThe wait staff was quick on their feet, and the Margarita I got was full of booze. So no complaints in that department. Nice outdoor seating! Great Bar area!\n\nI still giving this place only 2 stars because I have had good Mexican food, and this is just not it. \n\nIf I had to rate it for decent food not as a genre.....3 stars, but there are so many other things I could eat for the same amount at better food joints.\n\nTo recap- If you are hungry for American Mexican, this may be your favortie place after one visit.\n If you want Mexican, no no no. Forget it.","I have a lot of food allergies, the staff was very helpful with the menu and even prepared/grilled my food away from the rest to avoid cross-contamination. Plus, the Enchiladas Verdes was VERY good. I would definitely eat here again if I was in town.","If you like bland food that's Mexican in title only, subpar service, salsa that tastes like spicy spaghetti sauce, guacamole that's clearly from a bag (our server confirmed that it was \"pre-mixed,\" and we all know what that means), and pitchers of margaritas that are basically all ice, this is the perfect restaurant for you.\n\nIf, however, you're looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant that uses fresh ingredients and employs friendly, personable, and attentive servers, avoid this place at any cost.\n\nThe guacamole was bland (at best) and awful (at worst).  Our server was barely at our table--we waited for our check for at least 20 minutes.  The food wasn't offensive, but was definitely disappointing, as I had heard that this was the place to go for \"authentic\" Mexican.  It's not.  Go buy yourself a frozen burrito, a can of refried beans, microwave some tortilla chips, and you've basically got exactly what you'd get if you ate here.  \n\nThere were a lot of old, white people in the restaurant.  That's all I'm gonna say.  You can infer what you'd like from that.","I'd say 3.5, decent food, restaurant atmosphere is simple.","We went here last weekend, and I almost forgot to review it because it was just that underwhelming.  \n\nWe were seated by the kitchen, which meant every 5 seconds someone came bursting out of the metal swinging doors running.  I was briefly impressed by the quick pace of the waitstaff even though the constant bursting of the metal doors was annoying.   It made me think \"oh wow, these guys are on the ball!\"  That wasn't the case for our waiter.  His demeanor, movements, and voice indicated that we had gotten the stoned waiter.  Not the the giggly, silly stoner, more like the \"I'm barely conscious\" stoner.\n\nI had to repeat my order three times to him to get it right \"Mole burrito with mixed vegetables.\"  At one point he asked someone in our party if they wanted a refill on their soda, the answer was yes.  The refill came at the end of the meal with the check.  As other waiters were practically running back and forth, our server was seen trudging slowly and aimlessly at times.  Maybe he was lost, maybe he was on a journey, maybe he got some bad weed.  \n\nThe food itself was underwhelming, that is, when it finally arrived.  The tortilla used for the burrito was pretty soggy, indicating it had been sitting around for a while after it was made.  The mole sauce was insulting.  I make a better, meaner mole at home that puts Casa's to shame.  The appetizer cornbread was the best thing out of all the dishes, but like someone else had mentioned, there wasn't enough butter to go with it.  \n\nThe atmosphere is strange.  Big, open, cavernous spaces filled with tables, and a terrible acoustics problem.  Get a bunch of people in there, along with the exploding metal kitchen doors, and I couldn't hear anything my dining companions were saying unless I leaned in, turned my ear toward them, and asked them to repeat themselves.  \n\nBad service, mediocre food, and terrible atmosphere combined equals a bad time, and no repeat performance.","I dont get the reviews ?  i tried this place twice in the last couple weeks and the food was ok at best.  i sat in bar area both times and they seem to run short staffed as it took a while to be served and get refills both times.  they do seem very friendly once they get to you.","Tried this place for lunch on Saturday despite some of the reviews about the service. There aren't that many Mexican restaurants in Madison or near my house.\n\nSo we walk in and wait to be seated, and it took at least 5 min to be seated. We got water and chips pretty quickly and they were good. Took about 5 more min for a server to come get our drink order. Took awhile to get our beers but they came in nice frosty mugs. \n\nWe seemed to have two servers so I really couldn't tell who was the main one. \n\nThe food was quite good for tex mex and I'd go back for it. I had tacos and enchilada sampler, my boyfriend had tamales and my son had the kids nachos. We all liked the food.\n\nIf the service had been great I would have given 4 stars but could not justify it for this visit.","Went here and was impressed the Bartender John was very helpful with my questions as I had never been there before and brought a sample of the mole when asked what it tasted like so \n2 thumbs up for the staff\nI had the Polo Mole Chicken Breast Simmered in a Homemade Mole Sauce made with pumkin seed's roasted chile almonds nuts and unsweetened chocolate \ngarnished wtth sesame seeds and a side of Beans and Rice. \nit was Very Good. \n2 thumbs up for the Food.","A very good Mexican restaurant for Madison.  The bar is nice and cozy and the beer is always cold.  Good selection of beer too.\n\nFood is excellent.  I usually go for a burrito but sometimes the have very interesting specials that are always great.  I had one that used cactus and it was a nice gamble for me.  Introduced something new for my palate.\n\nThe chips and salsa as appetizers are amount the best in town.  Te hot sauce has a good bite and the chips themselves have some good spice.\n\nDefinitely a place to try if you are craving Mexican.","We were far from impressed with our visit to Casa Del Sol. We were referred there by a trusted friend ( the trusted part is now in question...lol) that said their food is amazing. Maybe going in with high hopes was a setup for failure. It was about 3pm, and the restaurant was all but empty. We were seated quickly and offered drinks, chips and salsa. All good so far. Upon perusal of the menu, I was quickly underwhelmed. I was in the mood for some carne asada and some steak tacos. I did not see these items on the menu so I ended up getting taquitos. They were ok. What was worse than the selection was the wait staff. There were about 3 female and 4 male workers. Their conduct was not becoming of a professional establishment wishing to do legitimate business centered toward customer satisfaction. They were playful with one another...fine, but also inappropriately flirtatious with one another. Chalk it up to boredom, giving the slightest benefit of the doubt, but this behavior should not be seen by any customers. They say first impressions are the most important ones, and I for one am not impressed. I can walk there in about 2 to 5 minutes, yet I will not be returning.  Disappointing.","This place is amazing!  Quality ingredients and the best service in town.  Oscar is the greatest server!!!  Delish chips and salsa! The food is amazing, the Burrito Tropical with grilled chicken is to die for!! mmhmm","OMG, the Chimichanga Mediterranea is one of my favorite all time dishes in Dane County!!! Seriously, it is amazing! I can't even tell you about anything else on their menu as I'd never order anything else as I am addicted to this. Seafood stuffed chimi with that white sauce, and fresh grilled veggies on the side. Plus their chips and salsa are excellent!\nNice outdoor deck seating.","My friends are in love with Mexican food and brought my husband and I to Casa del Sol.  My fish enchiladas were amazing - I loved the sauce!  I also really loved their chips and salsa served before the meal.  The chips come with slices of carrots - sounds weird, but they are delicious!  We requested more carrots and they brought a little bowl out for us.  The server was friendly, but not overbearing, so that was nice.  I gave it four stars instead of five for two reasons: 1) unfortunately the chips were a combo flour/corn, so my husband who needs to eat wheat-free couldn't have them, 2) the raspberry margarita was delicious, but not much alcohol, so that could have been better","Went there for lunch before a movie.  I had the chimichanga  with shredded beef.  Very best I've ever had.The beef was very tender and juicy. Just enough spice. And the sauce was not too salty like most places.  My husband on the other hand had house burrito with shredded beef. First few bites were shredded beef but the last 1/3 was some white meat, perhaps pork? It almost taste like turkey. Service very quick, Oscar our server was nice and alert.  My husband didn't complain because he's too polite. I ordered ice tea and they didn't have anything on the table to sweeten it, nor they offered. Which is fine with me because I like my ice tea plain anyways. \nThink worth give this place another try another day","What to say? Been here more than a few times with the family - mostly with a coupon. The restaurant is located on the top of a hill - personally, the outside is prettier than the inside. And if it's not scorching hot and humid, I'd recommend sitting on the patio.  The atmosphere is just not there for me. Call me a hypocrite - if the food's good, who cares about the atmosphere, right? Scratch that - You need it inside Casa Del Sol. Something is just missing, maybe booths? I just don't feel comfortable eating there. \n\nBut, the food is good. I wouldn't say it's excellent - but it's worth the trip. I've tried the enchiladas, chicken fajitas and the chille relleno. The service is usually great and quick. Margaritas not too bad either. The atmosphere just kills it for me as a night out on the town. More for family gatherings - because this place isn't meant reeling in customers by the dining room setting - it's the food. And it's (sorta) worth it!","Probably would have given it five stars for the food except that the tortilla chips were really spicy to me, I am a wimp about spicy food.  They put some kind of hot seasoning on them.  I think the salsa was spicy too but couldn't tell because the chips already spiced me out.  So I didn't eat them.  Good for the diet but disappointed because I love tortilla chips!  I had the Chimichanga Mediterranea which was EXCELLENT.  Plump yummy shrimp on top, the chimichanga itself was very good, rich and flavorful.  Probably a zillion calories. Came with white rice which was cooked well, and grilled vegetable which were great except the zuchini was bitter as it often can be.   Service was okay except it took a while for them to take my payment.  I was a single diner and it wasn't very busy when I went for dinner on a Tuesday night.  I'd go again and have the same thing, or maybe try the shredded beef chimichanga.","Loved the food, loved the atmosphere, loved the service!!! It is the best Mexican eatery I have been at since moving to Madison.","I had the tamales here, and the whole dish was disgusting. The rice tasted like super cheap Chinese take out, and don't even get me started on the beans. The waitress was nice, but that was the only good thing.","This place is pretty good, I think.  I come here a few times every few months.  The food is decent; the service less so.  I usually stick with the fajitas here and most of the time they are good.  The portions are decent and the flavors standard.  I have however veered away from the fajitas a few times, I ordered the guacamole chicken, and I was less pleased with the dish.  I will not be ordering that dish again.  I will continue to order their fajitas though.  They have decent seasoning and come with nice warm tortillas.  One thing that I do love here is are the complimentary chips and salsa.  They are nice and salty and have a pepper seasoning on it.  This place is worth a visit just for those.  \n\nThis place is decent.  I am rarely disappointed but never blown away.  I will however continue to patronize the joint because it's close to my house; oh and the chips and salsa of course.","Miguel was the worst waiter.  He stopped by our table only 3 times... drink order, appetizer order and dinner order... then never again, not to check drinks or see if our food was good.  I ordered my meal without tomatoes and it was loaded and I returned it for a new one and still never saw Miguel.  The restaurant never offered a free dessert or anything to apologize for the wrong order.  The food was decent but the service was horrible.","This place is pretty much your average Mexican restaurant. Prices are reasonable, menu is typical, and food is pretty good.\n\nWe went here for lunch and I ordered the mole enchiladas. They were pretty good and the portion was huge. The chips and salsa on the table was just ok; the chips definitely outshined the salsa.\n\nIt was good for a quick lunch, but I wouldn't recommend going for a special event or a date.","Good food for the price you pay, in my opinion! The chips and salsa are slightly spicy which makes it oh so good.  The spicy cheese curds are decent, and I've never had enchiladas there that I didn't scarf down happily.  The chile relleno is delicious too.  The rice as a side is a little dry, but nothing some sour cream or salsa can't fix. \n\nAlso, restaurant.com always has discounts that will save you a few bucks here!","Casa del sol is really good- but their portions are pretty large. Make sure you know that! For me, the shrimp quesadilla appetizer was definitely enough. The salsa and chips were also really good too. The chips come with some carrots pickles, which I've never had before at a restaurant."],"business_id":"CPC9LXgq7G_H_hCCfKoodg","name":"Casa Del Sol","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["today, it took forever for our waiter to just take our order, the three tables around us were seated after us and got their food before our order was even taken.","Lame selection of beers and lame restrictive happy hour menu - why just discount some of the beers?  Mall location often means longer wait times too, and this mall is becoming the sister mall to Metrocenter in so many ways beyond that.  Food was alright, service was a bit slow, and parking is nowhere near the entrance (because it is always full).","Great drink specials and they have great fried icecream","Not too bad... The service in the bar area was exceptional, but also we were the only ones in there at the time. Their happy hour prices are pretty good, we enjoyed ourselves.","Maybe 2.5 stars.\n\nService was prompt and friendly. Water delivered with no straws, had to ask. Son's water glass had stains on the inside. Sat on the patio.\n\nI had a chicken fajita burrito. It came with rice, and black beans. The burrito was bland, The chicken was grilled and cubed but not much flavor. There were also pinto beans and cheese in it but none of the ingredients were hot enough to fully melt the cheese so it was just kind of warm. The black beans were good, the rice...meh. \n\nOther dishes ordered were steak tacos that were good (4 stars) and a quesadilla appetizer which was just \"ok\". Both my kids told me that my own homemade quesadillas are much better. \n\n\nProbably won't be back not because it's bad, mainly because I have limited opportunities to dine out and I don't want to experience mediocrity when I do get the time to go out.","Food is still excellent, one of the best places for fajitas and mexican salads. However, the service has been going down hill. Waiting too long for things, checks being wrong, and service staff doesn't really give a rats a-- about serving you.","Love this place ate at many times in San Jose area when they came to Colorado we were happy not the same and not as good tried the one at this location and it was great, always fresh, love the salsa and chips will go back many times since we are moving to this area!!","Stopped by for lunch on a sat, have to say the last time I was at Chevys was up in the Bay Area with my pops about 5 years ago, so for me, it was like being there for a 1st time all over. Yes, this is a chain place, but it didn't feel like it.\n\n1st off, ordered a grande strawberry margarita with a double shot of tequila, oh baby that was good!\n\nChips and salsa have hit the table and now its time to cruise the menu,  I have to say our sever, Kevin was extremely nice and professional, made sure we had everything we needed and we never had a where is our waiter moment, I love love love great customer service! Awesome job Kevin! You my dear rock!!!\n\nSaw on the side of the menu you can soup or salad, a main entrée and a mini desert for 12 bucks, that right there was a screaming deal for my buck! So I went with it!\nOrdered the tortilla soup, chicken fajitas, and fried ice cream. The tortilla soup reminded me of my mom in laws, so dang good, thought I was home for a min, the chicken fajitas, oh man what a treat, they come with fresh tortilla, I watched Kevin press them & cook them.  The mini deep fried ice cream, oh that right there was sweet heaven!!  \n\nGood deal & good times down at Chevys!","Nice place. Pricy for being in a mall, and the waitress never let us know about any specials.","What can I say...foodwise, Chevys is Chevys. I was with my 6 year old and she was so well behaved, never even got up from her seat. The food came out quick then our waiter disappeared. 20 mins after we're done I saw him an asked for the bill...another 20 mins.  My daughter was getting anxious but asked, why don't you just ask someone else for the payment (she calls that the bill). Horrible horrible service. There were only 4 tables on the patio, not close to being busy.","This place has a nice environment along with good food. Happy hour here is probably the best for any mexican restaurants. What's better than $3 dollar drinks that are pretty exquisite and half off huge appetizer plates?","I am reading the reviews and surprised at some of them. I have been going here for about 2 years and really like it. A big plus is that it is in the mall. The food always tastes fresh and I was told they make mostly from scratch, which is a plus for me. I love the guacamole they make it at your table for you. The salsa and chips are so good, the best I have honestly tried in a restaurant. You can get them to go for around 8.00 for a huge bag and probably at least a pint of salsa. I always order the soup and guac. My hubby has had many things on the menu and always is satisfied. This is the only mexican restaurant my son goes to, he loves it.","Came here post movie for some lunch. After watching Riddick, all that action made us super hungry and Chevy's was a convenient walk from the theater.\n\nThe staff was super friendly, and we enjoyed two giant sized margaritas that came with super nachos as recommended. Surprisingly it was a deal when ordering this combination instead of ordering margaritas separately. I enjoyed my drink so much that I ended up spilling the last bit, and you know what the waiter did? He gave us several coupons for more discounted margaritas and food! Bring on the fun! \n\nThe steak fajitas were really good! I feel like you get more meat and fresher less processed meat here than you would at Chilis, but regardless I enjoyed them. It was such a treat to see the tortillas made before your eyes and then eat them fresh immediately. Despite being a chain, I'm a fan and i don't know why I didn't return sooner!","I love Chevys.  They serve their beer in chilled glasses and serve you the nicest chips and salsa free.  Their food is always nice and staff are very pleasant.  I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch or just a drink.  Ask Jose to make you a Lava Lamp drink, you'll like it.  Trust me.","This place is a great option when given the choice of the food court nearby. Usually shop at Arrowhead Mall for clothes since they have a better selection than PV. This is the last Chevys in town since they closed the rest of them.\n\nI love the Sizzling Fajitas at this place and that is what I always order. It is really good and comes out on a smoking hot plate making all sorts of fun noises. The meat is always tender with a lot of flavor. The wife usually gets the Fajita Salad with the Sizzling Chicken.\n\nReally like their homemade tortillas that used to come out of a niffy machine off to the side. Not sure if that machine is still functioning any more. Looked like they could have been made by hand this visit. OK with me.\n\nThe menu is rather large with lots of choices. The Chips and Salsa are definitely a score. I would recommend staying away from the standard items such as tacos, burritos, etc. There are too many great hole in the wall places around town with the authentic stuff for cheap.\n\nOur server did a great job although he seemed to be overworked with too many tables. Saw several other servers just standing around. The manger even seemed a bit out of sorts as he paced the floor back and forth. Even saw a bit of the Seinfeld nose episode. Was it a scratch or the pick? Good thing that sizzling fajita plate is hot. ¡LO SIENTO!\n\n3.25 STARS","Was out shopping with a girlfriend and decided to stop by and have a margarita. We asked the waitress how much the top shelf margaritas were and the waitress said they are $10.00 but we have a special where you get 2 of them and a free order of nachos grande. So, we said sure. That sounds like a great deal. We'll do that. Well, the bill came and it was $36.00 including tax. We called the waitress over and told her we were confused. She apologized for the misunderstanding stating that she had neglected to tell us the margaritas that came with the special are the larger size margaritas and they are more expensive. I told her there is no way we were going to pay $16.50 a piece for a margarita even if it did come with a free nachos grande. Had we known the drinks were so expensive, we never would have ordered the special. We weren't going to eat in the first place and the only reason we did it is because it was a great deal. The waitress sent the  manager, Santiago over and we explained what happened and he said \"sorry I can't do anything about it.\" He basically told us we ordered what we ordered and even if there was a misunderstands we needed to pay for it. After he argued with us for a few more minutes, he agreed to take $11.00 off of our bill. That was all he was willing to take off.  It was unbelievable given that we had misunderstood the price of what we ordered   because the waitress had told us the wrong price and the for the manager to argue with us, made it even more unbelievable. Santiago was a total jerk and acted as if we  were trying to get something for nothing. I will never go to that Chevys again and I will also tell my friends about my experience and urge them not go there.","I was pleased with the food. Good drinks and friendly service.","is chevys at arrowhead closed?","The best margaritas in town. I love the watermelon margarita the best but they only have it when in season. The salsa is really good too.  I am so disappointed they have closed at the Arrowhead Mall. I hope they relocate somewhere in AZ.","= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =\n\nIt's no wonder this place folded, really.  What we got here on the positive side when I stopped in for lunch with Scott W. was a beautiful dining room, excellent table service and gorgeous platters of food presented in top magazine fashion.\n\nSO, ¿What's not to like? you would ask, if you cared, and if the place was still open.  WELL, the food, in a word, was TASTELESS!!  I've never had such \"nothing\" bunch of Mexican food, except possibly at a similar fancy looking disaster case Mexican restaurant I tried in Sioux Falls, South Dakota a while back.  Also, the lunch prices were too high.  My order last time was $12.29 without a beverage.  By comparison, I eat at at La Piñata, which is totally nice, the service is great, the food is terrific and they really serve it up for about $11!\n\nSOOOO?  OUT with Chevy's, and hopefully IN with something better...  \"Maybe a BUFFET?\" Maxwell would say!  Ok, I'D say that too!     :-))","Stopped in here today at lunch time for a first visit ever to a Chevy's, joined by Scott W.  This place is nice inside, the booth seating was completely comfortable, the service was excellent, & the menu choices & layout were great, making it easy to order just what I wanted.     :-)\n\nNice chips arrived, with a little bowl of attractive salsa, & I ordered a three item \"Build Your Own Combo\", consisting of a Chile Relleno (of course!), a \"Slow roasted shredded pork tamale with New Mexico red chile sauce, & a soft, Picadillo Beef (hamburger) Taco, plus Spanish Rice & their \"Homemade Beans ala Charra\".\n\nPretty soon our orders arrived.  Mine was very attractively presented on a large and a small platter, with the beans in a large cup.  So far we're at 5 Stars!\n\nNow this order was a bit pricey at $12.29, so now we're at 4 Stars.\n\nUh oh.  Now we come to the TASTE of the food.  Everything, even the Chile Relleno, was BLAAAAH!  Now I finally know what Yelpies are talking about when they talk about \"Gringoized Mexican Food\".  THIS WAS REALLY, REALLY THAT, & you're getting this from a guy who LIKES chain restaurants!!  Ugh!!     :-O","Fresh...not! Went here years ago when they first opened and was impressed. In the neighborhood and remembered them so decided to try again. Major disappointment. The dish I remember best no longer on menu. Order beef chimi. Yuck! Filled with unseasoned ground beef and covered with what looked like (and tasted worse than\" Cheez-Wiz..","My family and I used to meet up at the Biltmore Chevy's for happy hour quite frequently and were bummed out when it closed. We went to the Arrowhead location for dinner Friday night and were sat right away, had excellent service, and delicious food. The waiter even brought my parents dessert for their anniversary. Surprisingly, one of the same employees was still working there and mentioned to me that our favorite waitress from the Biltmore location was still working for the company at the Mesa location. This is obviously a great company that hires great people! I expressed my compliments of the server to the manager because it was such a great experience. And the kiwi margarita was amazing!","this seems to be a great place to nurse a hang over with a little hair of the dog with the locals. Bar Tender was great and the beer was Ice cold.","Came here to meet my daughter for dinner and wow was the food good.  I have been here before and never has it made an impression like it did yesterday.  I noticed that the tortillas & tamales are homemade which is a HUGE deal in my opinion.  I ordered the guacamole appetizer which they make right in front of you and it is very flavorful and fresh.  I then ordered the farm fresh enchiladas which is a vegetarian enchilada with mushrooms and artichokes filled with cheese and covered in jalapeno cream sauce that was unbelievable good.  I loved this dish and the beans were also fantastic.  I have to say that I will be back for this dish alone.  The atmosphere is casual but clean and decorated in the theme.  Service was great and the margaritas were $3 each so I splurged as well.","The service was slow and the waiter was forgetful though pleasant. But the worst part was that the food was terrible and all the smokers were out that evening. We went out for dinner with the kids and sat outside to get some fresh air. It was 5pm so we figured it was optimal time to go out with the kids. Little did we know we were all going to get asphyxiated from smoke inhalation. We just moved here from out of state and I didn't realize how backwards Arizona is, environmentally speaking. They allow people to smoke at restaurants, they spray pesticides everywhere! No one is concerned about what they are breathing. Anyway the food portion was so tiny and we paid 11.99 for it. I won't go back.","I wish I knew more about Mexican food. It would let me know what I was talking about when I was to demean restaurants such as this one when they claim they serve Mexican food.  Maybe I am expecting to much going to a chain but shouldn't I at least deserve mediocrity?\n\nWhen the first thing you serve me is under cooked chips and place them on my table with what is best described as thimble sized portions of completely ordinary salsa, then we are off to a rough start.  Maybe the Mexican aspect of the restaurant comes from the fact that I needed to speak Spanish to order. I finally convinced the waiter of my order which was to be chicken quesadilla. The soda machine must have been non functional the day I ate at this location because I only received 2 drinks during my visit. When the quesadilla arrived I wished I had just gone to Taco Bell which I had originally contemplated before parking for Chevy's. The tortilla and cheese was standard fare but the chicken must have just come from the freezer. Bland, dry, and I could barely believe it was there. \n\nNo more ignoring ratings. I joined Yelp to let fellow food connoisseurs guide me in my dining experiences and I ignored them this time. For this, I apologize. I hereby declare from this day forward I will stop going against your recommendations and follow your advice. This experience taught me you all know what you are talking about!","Went for my husbands birthday today and as always it was amazing!!! Omg the combo fajitas were to die for..... The service from the hostess to our waiter Angel, to the manager of the restaurant was above and beyond. Kudos to Chevy's, you guys are awesome.","We are new to the area, and ran across this place by pure accident. We were pleasantly surprised. My picky kids even enjoyed it. The fresh tortillas and chips and queso dip were awesome. Great food and terrific service.","My family and I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. Great food, great service , and great atmosphere. We will be back :-)","NEVER GOING BACK. the management is horrible. i ordered a VEGETARIAN black bean burrito.. cut open and start to take a bite, it was a steak burrito. that's fine.. simple mistake. they bring me my burrito. half way through my vegetarian black bean burrito, i pull a chuck of steak out of my mouth. i wasn't trying to make a scene but the manager should know because that type of mistake should not be happening in the kitchen. either the workplace was messy enough that a piece of steak got into my bean burrito.. or they were sharing spoons to scoop it. something. and the manader walked over and in a rude voice asked \"what.. do you want another?\" uhm.. no thank you my appetite is lost. and he just humphs his breath and says \"fine i'll take it off\" and walks away with nothing else said. I am not asking for free money but that is no way to handle customer service. if this same scenario happened with tomatoes and i was allergic i could sue. Or at least act apologetic and say you will go investigate the kitchen.","I guess I don't know what I should have expected.  I had gone to a Chevy's once many many years ago, but couldn't remember how it was.  We were at the mall and decided to give it a shot.\n\nWhen we walked in, the hostess was very nice and sat us.  After that, it was pretty much downhill.  The waiter wasn't very friendly and somewhat short with us.  He didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  The salsa that was brought out to us looked like it had been prepackaged, sitting around and was in the shape of some other bowl.  It didn't taste much better either.\n\nI ordered the grilled chicken tacos.  The beans were alright, as was the rice.  The taco was dry and bland in some areas, except in the center, where the dab of sauce was.  It only made it taste like a chicken ranchero taco from Taco Bell.  Not something I'd want again.\n\nIt's not authentic at all, which is fine, but make it taste good.  I will not go back again.","This \"Mexican\" dining experience is the least authentic I've ever had.\n\nThe crispy chicken flautas tasted like convenience store 'taquitos'.\n\nTheir quesadillas had great tortillas that were admittedly tasty, but the cheese was questionable. Other Yelpers have pointed out it tastes like Velveeeta, which I'm not down for in a sit-down establishment like this.\n\nThe chimichanga is the worst I've ever had. The beans are too sweet, and don't even taste like they should be used for Mexican food. I tried to douse a portion with the habanero sauce at the table, but that was even sweeter. It was...gross, to sum it up in nice terms.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't HATE this place, it's just really lame food for such a great location, decor, and the friendly staff. The tequila menu is pretty legit, so I might swing by again while I'm shopping.","Ohhhhhh Chevy's how I love you. Their chicken fajita salad is one of my favorite salads anywhere. Crispy greens, grilled chicken, pepita seeds, avocado, salsa...yes please. Chevy's also likes to do a fruit of the month where they will make lemonades and margarita's using this fresh fruit puree. I had a cantalope lemonade, and let me say, one of the most refreshing delicious drinks EVER! I've also had their watermelon lemonade and mango lemonade, also great. Their chips and salsa are always great as well. The only so-so occasionally is the service.","I was very disappointed in Chevy's. I ordered the fajitas, which were pretty good. I got all beef. The chips and salsa were very good. I like a lot of cilantro and it was perfect. The problem with this place is the service. It took about 15 minutes after we got to our table for our server to come take our drink order. We had waited so long that we were ready to order, but he quickly said what can I get you to drink and ran away. Another 15 minutes and we got the drinks. You really can't mess up a beer order, but it happened. I ordered Coors Light, and I got Miller LIte. No No No. When I did finally get the Coors LIght it was hot. Enough said on the beer fiasco. To the food. I really like the Fajitas. They reminded me of Uncle Julio's in Dallas. Our server checked on us once but I think he was on something. He seemed really hyper and it was hard to understand him. He rushed to clear off our table before we were even finished. I would go back if I happen to be shopping in Arrowhead Mall again, but I wouldn't make a special trip. I am giving them three stars because the food was pretty good, and they are the best fajitas I have found in Arizona, but the service just sucks.","I wish there were half stars.\n\nChevy's has that perfect Happy Hour environment all day long.  Bright colors, fast moving waiters (even when the service is slow the waiters seem to be flying by!), plenty of activity, huge drinks, and food that all seems like it's an appetizer.\n\nThe chips and salsa are wonderful. . .beware you sometimes find the hot spot in the salsa and then burn for a bit.  If you are lucky enough to have an attentive waiter you may even get the basket refilled.\n\nAs I mentioned, there are always a bunch of waiters in bright red shirts flying this way and that, but they seem to rarely stop at your table to fill your drinks.\n\nThe food has the typical tex-mex flair...so it depends on your personal taste.  Being in Arizona, most seem to want that authentic homemade Mexican food taste...this is that more polished chain restaraunt taste.\n\nThis location is connect to Arrowhead Mall...so you can also sit out on the patio and people watch....","GHETTO!  I had the chili con queso and it was VELVEETA with salsa.  I even asked about it!  I was really disappointed with it.  It distracted me so much, I didn't even order dinner.  I went to the one at the Biltmore.","Not thrilled. Use to like this place but service has gone downhill. Salsa isn't the same freshness and nothing special with the food. Seemed bland.","This place can be a hit or miss but I am absolutely in love with their tamale plate. I get their chicken tamales with a green chili sauce. It comes with a big plate of rice and bean and all you can eat chips. Amazing!","It's been a while since I've been to Chevy's.  Too long.  I absolutely LOVE their salsa.  Love the smokey/roasted flavor.  Their chips are great too - light & crispy.  They also have a prickly pear margarita that is QUITE tasty.  But really, it's their salsa I go for.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.... mmm, salsa.","You know, I've got to give them 4 stars. As I always state, this is not in comparison to Posh, or Mastro's, or Ocean Prime, etc, but apples to apples people. Compared to other chain Mexican restaurants, Chevy's is a good, consistent standby. Fresh guacamole, homemade tortillas, and pretty darned decent carnitas. Call me crazy, but I'd say it's a solid dining experience. A far cry from the mass produced garbage at Macayo's, and we've always had friendly service, and they get brownie points for the military discount. Stay away from the fried ice cream though, much like everyone else's, it tastes like it's coated in corn flakes. Sadly, the best Mexican food I've ever had is in Holland, Michigan, a little hole in the wall called Margarita's. Whats up here in Arizona? I've tried Old Pueblo, Mi Patio, etc, and they are all icky, low quality, with dried out rice. so I stick with Chevy's or Z Tejas when I want something with a Mexican/Southwest flair. I think the Camelback location recently closed, so we go to the Arrowhead location.","All I ever eat here is their chicken fajitas. I love them so much that I can't bring myself  to order anything else. They come with fresh, homemade tortillas, creamy beans, flavorful rice, guacomole, and sour cream. This is one meal that you can share with another person and both of you get full. Their chips and salsa are some of the best as well. The service varies. I've had ok service and I've had excellent. I've eaten here probably about 40 times and only have had bad service maybe 3 times. Food is ALWAYS excellent. The manager there is happy to fix anything and check up on all customers periodically."],"business_id":"CmNCRMpiJVtaqYfd9X1INg","name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["One of my favorites for salsa and excellent Margaritas!","This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food.","I am not sure why I haven't reviewed Rosita's yet!  This is always our go to for authentic Mexican food that doesn't disappoint. I love the chicken flautas or regular chicken tacos. Kids love the cheese enchiladas. And apparently they make their red chile with beef fresh daily with a wonderful recipe that is favorite of my husband's and the server's.  The chips and salsa are full of flavor, especially when you mix in some of the hot sauce.  The only thing I can think of that I don't like is the water... It's tap and tastes terrible. Thankfully they have Pepsi products and gigantic cups to feed my Mt Dew addiction.","I really love this place but tonight not just the salsa but also the hot sauce was sour. Maybe it was because of xmas I assume theu closed. We asked for the manager and he brought out fresh salsa that was also sour. I cant think of any reason that would be acceptable. I know for a fact this placw jas a clean kitchen but maybe they need to revisit the inventory and product rotation. We got 10 percent off. But so me one please give me a reason why I should go back? Thank fully I did not get sick. Also let me add I love their crispy chicken tacos.  Tonight is just wasnt good.  Let me add that I have provably ate 100 of them over The last 15 years.","I love this place for Mexican food and have been going here for the past 7 or 8 years.  The service is always great whether you're with a large group or alone at the bar and the food is always great and served hot. \n\nIf you're looking at drinks you have to try the prickly pear margaritas... Seriously. Now understand that I love prickly pear anything which is surprisingly hard to find out here, but this place has got the best ones. I mean it... With sugar on the rocks, please. \n\nThis particular visit I ended up ordering the 2 item combo with a chicken enchilada and a tostada, which is pretty much my usual here. I enjoyed the chips and salsa while I waited for the food to come out, however this time they gave me both the regular chunky 'mild-ish' salsa along with the hotter stuff, guess they're starting to know me. If you like hot salsas be sure to ask for this, because they usually only serve the regular unless asked.  \n\nAnyways, the food came out promptly and was exactly how I like it.  The tostada was crisp and the enchilada was full of yummy chicken (they don't skimp on the chicken or add weird fillers here).  All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone over one of the larger chains any day. You won't be disappointed.","Went here for lunch today with my friend Sandy. It was nice and quiet despite being busy and lunchtime. We were seated right away and not 5 minutes later, we were blessed with chips and very delicious salsa to begin our lunch, as we both perused our menus, deciding what to have.\n\nOur waitress was an older lady named Jessie & she was very helpful with suggestions on what to try and the daily special. Sandy has been here a few times and decided to try their Street Tacos. I went with the Daily Special, which was 2 Cheese Enchiladas, rice, & beans. We each got a soda to complete our orders & as we waited for our meals, we caught up on things and enjoyed the complimentary chips & salsa.\n\nJessie was very efficient and great about checking on us, especially after we got our food. Our meals came out piping hot, looking & smelling very good, & we both enjoyed our lunch. My enchiladas were made just right & the cheese melted in my mouth upon each bite! Sandy said her Street Tacos were the best she'd tried in a while & I knew that I would definitely come to this restaurant again. \n\nGreat food + fantastic service=return visits!","Green chili burrito smothered in green sauce and melted cheese, rice and beans - time and time again - one of my fav meals anywhere.  I have tried green burros everywhere - Rositas is always the best.  Chips and salsa (and hot sauce) are the best around -and margaritas are great!  Sit at the bar and Mando always is the best bartender around.  I love Rosita's!!!","Excellent chips, salsa, and cold beer! Service is friendly and efficient too. \n\nPROS: chips are homemade, light and crispy, and not too oily as some restaurants tend to serve. Love their salsa, as it is just the right amount of spicy and not too chunky.   I had a carne asada chimichanga that was superb: fresh oil used to fry the chimi, and the meat was plentiful and tasty!  Throw in a textbook cheese crisp and a $2.50 pint (maybe 3) of cold Dos Equis, and life is good!\n\nCONS: Jury is out on the guacamole: I'd describe it as creamy, not chunky. This left me a little skeptical, as I like to know there is fresh avocado involved.  \n\nI'm a fan of Rosita's. Service w/ a smile, and they've got the basics down!\n\nCheers!\nRS","First timers...had the stacked enchaladas with shredded beef and the Rosita's Special.  Good salsa and chips and the dinners were good as well.  Lot a food and carried home leftovers.  Friendly staff.  Will be back...","Would have given 3 stars based on the food, but the server (Brianna) was what made this place get only 1 star.\nWe (4 of us) went for Cinco de Mayo and they weren't busy when we got there, about 430.  Brianna took our order, another guy brought our drinks, she didn't bother to tell him I wanted lemons for my water.  She didn't bother to ring in margaritas on the rocks instead of frozen, and when she finally came back to the table, she just kinda chuckled and said she didn't write it down and told them to take the wrong drinks to us anyway because we would be happy since they had alcohol in them....UMMM NO! it is not okay, we asked for more chips, she walked by them and kept walking.  A few minutes later we passed by them and got our own.    Asked for extra napkins...we had to get our own.  She didn't seem to do anything right.\nAsked to speak with a manager, Forrest, he seemed very timid and unsure of everything.  Not sure how he is even a mgr.  All in all she shouldn't be allowed to be a server, she also discriminates offering certain tables stuff while doing not even the bare minimum for others.","Margaritas are good.  Food is average, but always hot and consistent.","Service is top notch. I, go there for the best red chile in town! One point I did have an issue with their service and manager that had arizona syndrome but I have yet to see that person there ever again. They take care of their customers and ALWAYS serve great food. The mole and sopa was not quite as tasty as I like but decent. Great drinks as well. Rositas is a diamond in the rough. High 5!! HU","I have been going to Rosita's for years now. First started going to the one in Tempe but now that I live in Mesa I frequent this location most often. If there is one great thing about Rosita's it is the consistency, I have never been disappointed and the food is always great. The food is served quickly too so if you're starving like I usually am when I come the wait isn't long for it to be made. Portion size is fantastic, you get a lot of bang for your buck and a buck goes a long way. The girlfriend and I can get a great meal with leftovers for around $25. The only knock I can give is the service itself, it varies from time to time and usually tends to be on the subpar side.","You can't go wrong with Rosita's. While it isn't life-changing, I really haven't found better Mexican food in another restaurant around town. When I lived in Vegas, I would crave food from this place and couldn't find anything that was even a close comparison. \n\nIt is definitely unassuming, located in a little strip mall at Dobson and Guadalupe. There's predominantly banquette-seating with just a few tables that are half banquette, half chairs. There is a bar and a dining room - they often offer the option of seating in either area and I recommend the dining room over the bar. It is brighter, more comfortable, and I feel that the service is more attentive. \n\nThey serve delicious salsa and chips to start, and also have a hot sauce that has a good kick. If you're interested in an appetizer, our standby is the Cheese Crispi - either plain or with Green Chiles. Adding some of the aforementioned hot sauce is a good plan for nice flavors :) \n\nMy \"go to\" is their Green Machaca Beef Burro, deep fried, with Cheese inside. I have had Machaca at a few other restaurants and theirs is definitely at the top - it is a stewed shredded beef and is nice and moist with LOTS of flavor. I order it as the Burro deep fried, which is basically a chimichanga but without the sour cream and guacamole. \n\nAnother fun item is the Rosita Chiquita Sampler - you choose 4 mini items from a list - I usually get a Chicken Taco, Beef Flauta, Green Chile Beef (served in a little tortilla bowl), and a Green Corn Tamale. This comes with rice and beans and is nice when you aren't sure exactly what you want and you can instead try a little of everything. \n\nI don't order dessert here very often, but have had their sopapillas (fried dough with honey, cinnamon, and sugar) which are a bit iffy (sometimes good, sometimes not) \n\nThe service at Rositas is typically pretty good, although not always the most upbeat. They tend to be quick and efficient. They serve their sodas in HUGE glasses so that you don't have to wait for refills (because you typically don't need one) \n\nThe pricing is a bit high for what you get, in my opinion - their prices have gone up $3-$4 an entree over the past 7 or 8 years, and the quality has stayed exactly the same. \n\nThat said, it is delicious and a great standby - check it out!","Good food, but the service varies.","There is a lot of pretty good Meixcan food.  Other wise I would have given it one stars.  The service 9 out of 10 times is not good.  In fact  I have been there and gotten an attitude more than once. My main complaint is this place closing early.  Today they closed early for Easter.  One hour early I think is a pretty bad excuse.   If this was the first time I went all the way over there and they closed early that would be one thing but this is the second time this has happened.  Think I have eatten there for the last time.","This was another location that was on the list of places to try while in town. I did, and enjoyed the food very much. Being from South Jersey and now living in MD there are cookie cutter Mexican and Southwest places throughout the area. So that being said even an OK Mexican Southwest joint is going to be fantastic for me. There are a few staples that make places stand out for four stars and this place had them. There are a few things in addition to the food that makes this place great.\n\n\n\"The Good\"\n-  The staff is very attentive and polite. The fresh chips (which were awesome) arrived before I could crack open the menu. The Dr. Pepper stayed filled the entire meal and the food came out fast and was delicious;.\nI ordered a combination platter to try some different things that I like taco, tamale, etc... all were very good and delicious, the plate was packed but did not have that ...\"Oh here are the sides with a few small bits of the main. It was a good balance and tasted even better.\n- The Salsa is also homemade, tastes great and is a great start to the meal.\n\n\"The Meh\"\n- When you are told to lock your doors while inside ... take the advice.\n- In a strange out of left field observation ... not a lot of windows.\n\n\"The Bad\"\n- Nothing really bad to comment on.","Green corn tamale, rice & beans, chips & salsa, and a margarita. One of my all time fav meals. Tamale is one of the best anywhere. Salsa is perfect. This place has been there forever - and there is a reason- good food! Sit at the old school bar and watch a game while you enjoy fantastic Mexican food! I try to make this happen about once a week at Rositas.","My family and I have been eating at Rosita's for 14 years and we keep going back. It's authentic and spicy. Great salsa and many choices. I usually get #37 (taco, enchilada and tostada). I recommend trying Rosita's if you haven't yet.","The food was most excellent!! Especially for the price. Only downfall is that its too close to my house!","All I can say is very bland!  Their chicken fajita bowl had no flavor and their spanish rice was so so.  Won't be returning.","Finally stopped by this place after a year of living right by it was actually way better than i thought it would( yes I judged) Lots of seating and the bar area has nice big comfy booths also. Service was very good and food came out quickly. They have a HUGE menu and not too expensive either. Everything was really good, we had a crap load of leftovers. Chips and salsa were also good as well :) Will have to go by for a second time to see if I can bump up my star rating. I'm just not a huge Mexican food fan so i am pretty hard to please in this area of food so go and try it out for yourself cause it def is not a bad place!","Good Mexican food","My better half suggested I eat here when I visited Phoenix. I think he likes it so much because he has memories here.\n\nThe food was ok. The cheese crisp is really good. The best part of Rosita's was the prickly pear margaritas.","I have no idea why I keep returning to this place, it really isn't great or fancy.  Last night I didn't even like the salsa, and the chips seemed stale.  I had a pork burro, very very very very very salty.  Yikes!  And I a usually the one who uses the salt shaker.  I guess it is convenient to meet a friend, but something has got to give here.  One more shot then I will possibly have to move on.  Oh, and did I mention that they didn't even offer us a refill on the chips?  they gave us an extra salsa but whatcha gonna do with extra salsa?  It was ok, just not great...","I have lived here since 1984 and this was the first place I ever ate in Arizona as a 5 year old. I keep coming back for more over and over again. I crave it constantly! I get the simple cheese enchilada with rice and beans and it's super hot on a hot plate every time and still tastes the same after all these years. Best salsa/chips you will every have as well. Massive drinks is always a bonus. Not giving it 5 stars due to the inside not have been touched in probably 30 years. Needs to be updated a tad, but other than that...food wise, it's my favorite mexican food in AZ. :)","Great food! My family has been dining here for years. Their menudo and beef tacos are awesome.","i keep going here. i don't really know why. i think maybe they're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!\n\nbetter than the one on university.  delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas. giganto sodas.  average tacos (the chips and salsa make up for it).\n\nprobably will go there tomorrow.","I love this place. I always feel like I'm walking into a grandma's kitchen when go. The chips and salsa are always fresh and tasty. The seasoned chicken burro enchilada style is my fav. It's pretty massive, and I can only finish it when I'm absolutely starving. The booths are big and comfy, and the bottomless beverages are always a plus in my book.","I have been eating at Rosita's for years, and have generally been pretty satisfied with their meals here.  Portions are good, and even their \"lighter\" size burrito is still big enough to make me full.","This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant since moving here in 1979. Fast service friendly,  staff great food at great prices. Chips and salsa are excellent, love the burro enchilada style. Daily specials are greatvfor bargain hunters.","I went to Rosita's for the first time tonight after driving by it for about 20 years on my way to other establishments. Tonight was the night to try it out because a place we know we like looked really busy. The entry way was super crowded (not from being too busy) as customers who enter have to walk around the customers who are in line paying for their meals. It seemed like my kids were getting in people's way. I'll be the first to notice when my kids are being annoying, but in defense of their innocence on this occasion, I must say they had nowhere safe to stand as we waited for the hostess to return. My toddler was almost taken out by a bag of takeout food being offered to a customer standing in the very crowded foyer. How could I have explained that tragedy to his grandparents? \n\nWhen we were finally taken to the \"dining room\" I felt as if I had been magically swept away to a 1970's Waffle House. The lighting in this room -which consisted of ceiling fans and recessed can lights- could truly only be understood by folks who have found themselves in police interrogation rooms. The sunniness of the room does nothing for the ambiance, as it only makes patrons aware of how many crushed chips are on the floor and how the decor is reminiscent of the living room of an 85 year old \"winter visitor\" from Minneapolis. Normally the decor of a place isn't something I would critique, but I would expect something a little more pleasant when price range is considered. It's like being asked to pay the price of a bottle of Dom and instead receiving Boone's Farm Wine. No, it doesn't break the bank, but seriously, this is AZ; some of our best Mexican food is served on a paper plate. I would never critique these places for their lack of ambiance. This place, however, with their $6 (for one) shrimp taco, doesn't warrant the price tag. \n\nUpon being seated our waitress took our drink orders. I decided to have the chicken mole (12.95) and my husband had the green chili chimi dinner (10.95). I think the kids' meals were a pretty good deal and I liked that I was able to order soup for my little guy. After our drinks came, we waited and waited to have someone bring us chips and salsa. We began to wonder if they were in fact complimentary here, as numerous members of the staff walked by without offering them. I finally asked our waitress for some as she walked by. She looked at me like I had a butt growing in the middle of my forehead and said, \"yeah, sure,\" and kept walking. About 5 minutes later she stopped a busboy right in front of our table and told him that when he \"had the time\" he should get us some chips. I was mildly annoyed. \nHe stopped what he was doing (I guess he had the time) and got them for us. Thanks big guy! \n\nWhen the food arrived I was in shock at the portion size. The meat on my plate was enough to serve my whole family. In my opinion this isn't always a good thing. I would rather be served less food and charged a smaller price. These grotesque portions have led to our country's reputation in the global community as the land of lard. Enchanting. The chicken mole itself was decent, nothing to write sonnets about, but it was good. It was served with some iceberg lettuce (tepid from the hot plate), pinkish tomatoes (delightfully flown in from Chile, I'm sure), and a warm, soft tortilla on the side. I liked it well enough. The boy's soup (ablondigas) was \"mildly seasoned\" exactly as the menu proclaimed. The prevailing flavor was that of the saltines we crumbled over the top. Was this bad? No. He's 3, he likes \"mildly seasoned\". He also seemed pleased with his very large meatball. My daughter must have enjoyed her taco, because she left no evidence of its existence on her plate. My husband's chimi was really good. In fact, if we find ourselves there again, I'd suggest splitting one of those with him. It was enormous. \n\nThe bill came to $39 and some change. I felt a little cheated, as I know places in this town where the experience would have been a bottle of Dom at a Boone's Farm price. At least I'll get some \"not too bad\" warmed over chicken mole out of the deal.","I often go to Rosita's to meet an old old friend.  We do overstay the normal time frame for dinner, but what the heck we are girls and we have a lot to say!  I love the chips and salsa, there is just something about fresh chips and salsa that makes me melt.  We had ordered some kind of cheese dip and that was delish as well.  I ordered the cheesecruip with beans, cheese, black olives, and onions, WOWZA was it good.  I nornally just get cheese and onions and this was sooooo much better.  The normal waitress did not wait on us and the girl that did was a little slow, maybe she was in training.  Not really sure.  Everyone is always friendly.  It is just simple mexican food, always good, nothing fancy!","This place looks very dirty. I don't know if it is, but I didn't feel very comfortable eating there. I did eat there, though, and the food was pretty mediocre. Nothing had much flavor or spice. I would not come here again.","Everytime I visit Arizona, I have to eat here!!!! Their machaca beef chimichangas are excellent! Top it off with their margaritas is even better.  Their free salsa and chips are so good too! Their prices are inexpensive and their servings are humungous! You can't go wrong here. Great family atmosphere. I wish they can deliver to me in Los Angeles lol.","Pretty average Mexican food.  Went for lunch and had the stacked enchilada plate with chicken.  The chips served before the meal were hot and crispy but the salsa was only fair.  Like mine chunky and this was a bit too watery for me.  The stacked enchiladas were nothing special.  Store bought corn tortillas swimming in green sauce and cheese.  The chicken inside had little flavor and could have been shredded better.  It came as a couple of large chunks of meat.  The beans and rice...well...average once again.\n\nService was okay as was the cost.  Guess I prefer the little places closer to downtown Phoenix in the 16th-24th street area as they are much more authentic tasting.  This would probably be a good option for families with small kids or older folks looking for more bland Mexican options.\n\nAll in all rates a meh.  This is my first usage of the meh word as I didn't feel I understood it until now.","this is very bland, Americanized Mexican food. I had the stacked enchiladas, with fideo as a side.... i gotta say the fideo was REALLY good, but.. well. it's hard to mess up fideo!  Otherwise, the salsa tastes like raw tomato sauce, the enchiladas were far less than spectacular, and the guacamole we ordered was similar to what could be had at any grocery store. There are so many more exciting, fresher tasting, less expensive Mexican eateries in the area, so I don't have any plans on returning to Rosita's.","I'm going to put the caveat on this review that I am friends with a few of the family members who own Rosita's BUT, I got to know them by coming in to eat. \n\nThe fried beef tacos are a fantastic indulgence. But I've discovered that I'm a fan of their carnitas too. Their fish tacos are great - marinated not battered and friend. And, if you're not a bean eater, try to sopa de fidello (noddle soup). \n\nFrom the bar, consider the house margarita or the matriarch's namesake cocktail - Rosita's Tea. \n\nCheck your attitude at the door, sit back, relax, and enjoy.","Pretty sure just thinking about the chicken chimi with salsa con queso right now is enough to make me wanna head there for lunch.  Highly recommended.","Since moving to Arizona, I've found an appreciation for mexican food (except for beans... I dont know why, but I just can't get into them). We went to Rosita's on a double-date- my boyfriend and the other couple used to go there a lot \"back in the day\" and they all love it. I guess I just don't fit into the mold. \n\nThe chips were average... the salsa too- not very spicy and a little watered down even. I ordered a combo plate, trying a beef enchilada and a chicken taco. Both were average... nothing to write home about. Equivalent to Filberto's for about 3x the cost. \n\nThe atmosphere was not my favorite... lots of families there at 8pm... with lots of screaming kids. Why did each adult couple have 7 kids with them??? \n\nMy favorite part of Rositas = their huge glasses of pop. I only needed one refill of my diet coke :)","Another Delicious Lunch! \n\nThis time I went all out and ordered a Carnitas Chimichanga Enchilada Style (see pics) \nWow! The Pork was so juicy, tender and flavorful it wasn't greasy at all this was such an indulgent thing to eat with all the cheese and sour cream and sauce etc. The only thing I didn't like was the guacamole because it was too spicy for me other than that it perfect to the last bite, Yes I ate it all! OINK!! \n\nThe Hubs got his usual Stacked Enchiladas with a fried egg on top.(see pics) \nThis time the enchiladas were served in a little crock which made the edge of the tortilla crisp but other than that he loved them once again. \n\nRositas will be the perfect place to pick up some food for a \"potluck\" \nI'm going to take advantage of their catering menu since I've got a party to attend next month.\n\nIf you're ever in the area don't be scared, just go in and enjoy yourself!","I first found out about this place when my neighbor mentioned he was one of the cooks and so graciously surprised us one day with a couple platters of enchiladas and a giant bag of chips and salsa. \n\nWe loved it so much we decided to go to the restaurant and eat. \n\nJust for the record,I'll have you know some of the best Mexican Food Restaurants I've eaten in have had no windows and Rositas is no exception. \n\nService was prompt and friendly. Chips were hot and crisp. Salsa was good too but not as good as the kind we were given by our neighbor...must have been his special recipe ;-) \n\nI ordered the 2 item Lunch combo for $7.95 and chose a chicken taco and a tostada (see pics) \nThis is something I typically order everywhere I go and it's usually swimming in grease, but not here! Not even a drop!! \nEverything was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!! \n\nMy husband ordered their Stacked Enchilada Platter with fried eggs on top (see pics) \nUnbelievably good! Again Hot and Fresh and Truly the absolute BEST Enchilada Sauce either one of us has ever had! \nThis is now the go to place for Enchiladas! \nI even had to ask for a side of the sauce for my dish I liked it so much. \n\nI will definitely be back to try more from the expansive menu. They even sell items in bulk to go, great for when you aren't in the mood to make dinner, Rositas to the Rescue! \n\nThey are open at 9am for Breakfast too and serve hot cinnamon crisps instead of chips and salsa, now if that's not a reason to go I don't know what is!","very close to a 5...  so a 4.5 but yelp fails at halves\n\nOnly reason prevented me from a 5 is that it's more of a family place and traditional setting that I'd like to hang out with friends at... lots of kids... sorry I can't do the screaming thing.\n\nFood wise... chips and salsa are SOO frickin good.  I used to stop by on my way home once a week and buy a big bag of chips and a big thing of their salsa... \n\nCookin is always good and comes out pipin hot exactly as ordered and I always order custom style and they have no problem making it the way I want it.\n\nI've been going here for years and will continue to do so.  Also this one is better than the one on University.","I recently had breakfast at Rosita's.  I had a pork-filled omelette, enchilada style with green sauce.  It was good.  Something different, much better than a free grand-slam from Denny's.  They serve the meal with corn bread and a sweet glaze, along with warm flour tortillas.   I paid about 9 bucks for breakfast.  I would like to go back and try out the rest of the breakfast menu.  They have a \"gringo\" menu that includes pancakes, etc.","Place is still ok...the lights were turned up this time and I saw the restaurant in its full glory. It's clean, but a little dusty here and there. Service was fast and friendly and I forgot they served Pepsi...and none of these 8oz glasses of pepsi, either. We're talking, plastic cup, chug a lug cuz you're thirsty kind of big - I was looking the glass and was thinking, \"Is this a 40 oz diet pepsi goodness?!\"\n\nThe food was so-so. It hit the mexican food craving since Rosa's was closed on a Sunday. Damn you, Rosa's!\n\nThis is still an ok place for me to eat, but I won't deliberately go there unless all other mexican food options are exhausted -- and I will choose Rosita's over Serrano's any day.\n\nps\nDid I mention they have big glasses of Pepsi?!\nOh yea, the no windows thing still freaks me out.  :D","Average, very average.  Wouldnt return.","HEPL\n\nSeriously HEPL\n\nI kind of like this place, but really...WHAT THE F*CK IS UP WITH THESE PLACES AROUND HERE WITH NO WINDOWS?! I get a bit paranoid and creepy crawly. I know it sounds silly, but I have issues with places that are super dark and serve food.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, really. It was passable. When I'm feeling super lazy I come here but make sure I eat fast and am outof there in half an hour - the no windows thing really freaks me out.\n\nService was fast, snappy and very friendly. Food wasn't so shabby, but too bad I couldn't look outside and watch traffic.\n\nNo windows place that I kind of like but will have to settle for to go.\n\n*mumbles*nowindowswtfiswrongwiththistownandrestaurantswithnowindows*mumbles*"],"business_id":"CuyNmwDOLeMTrbv2c6rNxA","name":"Rosita's Fine Mexican Food","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Visiting Arizona from San Diego. Stopped here before going to the zoo. Cute little town and excellent breakfast and great service.","So far, so good. They are a brand new location, but they fit my basic requirements: the food is good, and well-priced. Service was speedy and courteous - almost too courteous, since we were asked if we were doing okay maybe seven times or so. Parking close to this place can be a pain (typical of Mill Ave), but it's a nice and casual spot to unwind for a laid-back lunch. Conveniently right next to a light-rail stop.\n\nIt's a typical sports bar meets casual mexican food place. Lots of television screens showing sports games and CNN, a good-sized bar, what looks to be a decent spot for a live DJ (maybe for special events or weekends?), and fun and tacky airbrush decor on the walls of a mexican oasis. I have no opinion on the drinks (since we didn't try any), but once the food arrived (fairly quickly), everything we tried was good. Service was friendly, and the noise level was great at the time we went (mid-day). We found out that they have a punch card, to get a free lunch after you go through five or so. Sounds good to me.\n\nObviously still a new location that's working out some kinks, but it's off to a good start.","This place was great! Until we got the bill and were over charged.  Come to find out, things may be more expensive \"on race days.\" Weird. I didn't see that noted anywhere.  Not in the menu or on a sign anywhere near a door.  The food was fantastic, the service was tolerable for how busy it was.  Our server did hook our table up with cards that get us 10% off throughout 2014 (though the cards are labeled for 2013).\n  \ntl;dr:  Don't come on a race day! The Award Winning Crunchy Tacos are delicious! Try the Smashed Potatoes!","Convenient location and great food sets this Mill avenue bar apart from the cliche college thumpers.\n\nGreat wait staff pampers to all your shot needs while cooking up tasty mexican food. Delicious margaritas all at a good price.","New Location! \n\nThis place is close to work so me and the co-workers stopped in.  \n\nGood:  Location and staff looked really busy/hard working....decently cheap drinks and food.  \n\nBad:  They were out of about 25% of the menu/unprepared and the food just wasn't that good.  I feel sorry for people that come to AZ and have \"Mexican Food\" at places like this.  Even the rice and beans (simple things) are just mediocre and have no character.  \n\nI'm getting the vibe this is definitely more of a \"drink\" spot than a \"food\" spot.  After a few drinks...maybe everything will taste better!  \nThis place needs a little time to get its act together. I'm hopeful.","Great location, fun staff, yummy drinks, and awesome food! I had a quesadilla with beans and rice and it was delicious!","Great Food! Had the Award winning crunchy tacos & they were awesome! My kids had the burger & chicken and they loved them! I had to finish their fries...Yum!","Im really glad this new location opened so close to my house! Were big fans of the wings at the original Loco location, and now we dont have to go all the way to Scottsdale for them (like its far, but I digress).\n\nThis location is about twice the size (inside) of the Scottsdale location. It was clean and theres a variety of different places to sit. We chose the bar tops in the corner. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We had our Loco staples: the salt and pepper wings (so, so good), and tacos. I actually tried the shredded pork taco this time as opposed to the steak one I usually get and I was not disappointed.\n\nLoco has some great daily specials (taco Tues, wing Wed, etc) and their happy hour specials are great.\n\nIm sure this will become a Mill Ave staple.","My girlfriend and I always start here when we decide to come to mill.  This is our go to.  I have to say we haven't eaten here a whole lot, but when we have the food is great!  Great quality food for a great price.  You  can tell the beans don't come from a can and that the salsa is made in house every day.  \n\nWe usually just sit at the bar and drink before we start our night, for happy hour or to catch a game/event downtown.  The service is exceptional at Loco bar none.  We always are well taken care of at loco and haven't had even the slightest bad experience.  \n\nFor instance, yesterday we stopped in for a few drinks and there was some miscommunication between the guys working the bar.  We didn't get a drink as soon as we usually do, but the guy that was helping us was more than apologetic and even bought us a free round!  A tasty little treat.  \n\nLoco plays the best music out of any bar on mill.  A good mix between 90's and current EDM but very relaxing overall.  Just what I am in the mood for 99% of the time.  \n\nClean place, great food, great service! What is not to love!","I know five stars seems crazy, but my boyfriend will tell you, I'm obsessed with this place. The waitstaff are friendly, caring, prompt, and efficient. I try to come here every Taco Tuesday, and have been like that for the past two years. There's a Loco in Tukee that I used to go to, but they charge more for drinks and the tacos are never as full. I'm always amazed by how well the staff handles the Taco Tuesdays, where I expect they are extra busy but always get my order out quickly and never seem stressed or rude. Whenever I'm having a dinner with friends or family from out of town, I come here. If it's a Tuesday, I can tacos for $1 and feel full, and a $4 margarita. I come on normal days too because i can always expect the food to be consistent, but I'm a bargain eater at heart. \n\nJust remember that tacos are normally more expensive, so when you tip, tip off of the normal price, not the Tuesday bargain. Especially if you come back often like me. \n\nMy only real complaint is the DJs are often too loud. I get trying to make it more of a party place to compete with the other places on Mill.... but if it's too loud I feel rushed and can't talk to my friends! But if you come early enough, there's no DJ anyways, haha.","I have been to the Loco Patron in Oldtown and love the Enchiladas there so had to try the new one... Took my girlfriend in for Happy Hour and we had a awesome time for cheap! A pleasant surprise was how you can watch the Sunset off of A mountain and watch people hike! Definitely recommend the new one...","Excellent happy hour deals, delicious food, friendly and patient staff, overall a great place to get some Mexican food.","Very good tacos would be a good way to start this review. They have alot of them in all forms available and whatever protein you can think of also. They also have American food like burgers, but this is a Mexican joint right? Came here before the ASU game and the bar was pretty full, it's a long ass bar for sure. Post happy hour, but Bud light was just $3 bottle and the chips were free (unlimited) and the salsa was very fresh, bursting with jalapeno's and finely chopped tomatoes (a real salsa). The tacos that caught my attention were the award winning crispy tacos that comes with two sides for $11. A bit pricey, but the tacos were loaded with shredded beef, slices of avocado, mexican cheese and other condiments and the crispy shells were super crispy and had a great crunch. The side dishes were good too, pretty good Mexican rice and something called Smashed Potatoes, which were two giant chunks of crunchy taters that could be smashed I guess with your own fork. Either way, it worked with the white dipping sauce (version of ranch?).\n   The only problem with two tacos for $11 is that on the way out I saw  a flyer for $2 taco tuesday which is way cheaper than my dinner, but i doubt they use the crispy shell on those guys. Still sounds like a great deal.","I've been to this Loco Patron a few times, but never longer than about 15 minutes. \n\nWhy am I giving a place 4 stars that I rushed out of so quickly? \n\nThis place is the perfect spot to grab a drink if you have to wait for the Light Rail when heading downtown. I don't live real close to a light rail stop, so when I use it, I get dropped off at the station right next to the place (like, RIGHT next to this place), and inevitably miss the train I wanted to catch and have to kill 15-20 minutes. That's when I stop in here and grab a marg or beer.\n\nIt's a pretty spacious bar & always looks clean. This last time I stopped in was during Happy Hour, and I honestly never realized how good a HH Loco has. I don't ever hang out on Mill, but I'll continue to stop in here for a drink when using Light rail to head downtown. Also, now that I know what they're HH is like I'll keep Loco in mind when I go out in Scottsdale (I'm assuming both locations have the same specials).","Doesn't really fit the mill scene. Decent for happy hour or chips and salsa. Lotta fohawks in this joint.","I love the fact that HH prices are really cheap and the food was decent. I got HH tacos, a margarita and split a cookie dessert with tip and was under $15. Not bad! The ambience reminds me of San Felipe's and Salty Senorita. My friend and I sat outside and was a little loud with all the noise from Mill and the planes coming down. It has a really nice bar though with tv's that can be watched inside and outside. I can see this place popping for night life because when we went for HH, it wasn't very busy. Service was also a bit slow, I remember commenting to my friend about how long it took for us to receive our food. All in all I was glad to have tried it and would probably return.","Service was bad even for a bro bar. \nFound this place while looking for food shortly after the Super Bowl. Big banner out front said \"Super Bowl Party till 2am\". The bouncer assured us the kitchen was still open and invited us in. \nThe place still had a few people in it but no problem getting a bartender right away and asking for a menu with our drinks. We then looked over the menu and purposely ordered something that would require a minimal amount of effort to make and clean up in case the cooks had already started to close down the kitchen.\nThat was the last time we ever talked to our bartender or any other staff in the building. \nAfter about 20mins I personally went to check on the status of our nachos as the kitchen is open for the public to view. I saw the forgotten nachos burnt under the heat lamp. We were the only people to order food so I can see how it might be easy to forget. I mentioned something to a cook to remind him about the nachos then went back to my empty drink at the bar. Another 10mins or so before the cook took initiative and delivered us a plate of nachos that was not only burnt but now had been sitting so long they were cold. I might add the toppings were pretty light. Its a stretch to label this plate of chips \"nachos\".\nBy now the crowd had dwindled to mostly employees on or off the clock. It took another 10mins or so before anyone wearing a loco patron shirt came to check on us. I then told the bartender to forget about the nachos and bring the bill for the drinks. No wait on that. \n\nIf you want to just close down and have an employees only party then drop some hints before i waste precious time thinking I've found food and drinks still open on a Sunday night. Take down your signs that boast you'll be open till 2am. And if you forget someone's nachos and get called out on it, have the decency to at least reheat and sprinkle some fresh tomatoes on those stale ass chips before serving them.","Loco Patron has long been a fixture on Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale, but I've always gone there more for the margaritas and barcrawler atmosphere than for the food. I haven't had any food at the Scottsdale location in several years, but I was highly impressed with the amazing happy hour offerings I sampled from the new Tempe location, which opened this past December on Mill Avenue right by the light rail.\n\nTheir happy hour runs from 3-7 p.m. daily and features a ton of hearty food options for very little moolah. On my recent visit there, my boyfriend and I shared tostadas ($5) and tacos ($3), which were basically the same thing, save for different cheeses -- go for the tacos with a corn tortilla and cojita cheese instead of their shredded mix, and you should be good.\n\nWe also got a cheese crisp, a steal at only $2! The food was all great and a really phenomenal value for the portion you got, too.\n\nPlus, you get free chips and salsa with any meal, so we were definitely feeling full without spending a ton.\n\nBesides the great food offerings, happy hour drinks are worth the visit, too, with $3 beers, wine and wells and jumbo beers starting at only $4.25. The Mill Avenue location also features a cool patio overlooking the busy street, and there's a huge bar and tons of televisions broadcasting sports throughout the venue. The service was fast and friendly, and it's nice that it's conveniently located to the light rail in case you have too many margaritas.","Friends and I usually go to the Scottsdale location, but I live in Tempe so I'm super happy they opened one here!\n\nLove it on Taco Tuesdays! Great specials! $1 tacos and $4 margs!\n\nOur Margaritas last night were really good and strong! Music was loud, crowd was fun, staff was cool!","Came here to check out the margaritas and bar food\nBar food usually isnt the best but its always good to eat while youre drinking\nAnywho I had me a beergarita and I really liked it\nThe service was nice and it was a pretty chill atmosphere\nI think its a great location and I had a good experience here\nI think it would be a good place for a group of friends\nAfter all it is on Mill\nNow you can start your crawl on the North End\nand stumble down South \n:D","Ahh Taco Tuesday - a way to get you in the door and eat inferior tacos. The review for the crunchy tacos here still stands - those were pretty good. I guess there isn't much you can do to make a $1 ground beef taco special, so it was was it was - a flour tortilla lightly grilled with some beef and tomatoes and bagged cheese. The $3 happy hour beer (kiltlifter)  helped wash it down. \n    Grease factor - moderate\nOther cheap tacos are available, but not in those \"famous\" crunchy shells. Those cost $11 each and every day. Part 1 of taco Tuesday exploring.","This little hangout is right off the light rail. If it is happy hour, it is a definite place to start out your drinking adventure. The bartenders were really friendly, it was a nice casual atmosphere, and the drink were cheap yet strong. The food didn't look so appetizing so we didn't order any, which is sad, because I love to eat and drink, but overall the place was okay.","Totally not really into this place.  Had a taste of every taco.  Meh.  Give me a BEER!  They have awesome atmosphere and they have beer thats it.","I really need to start of list for Mill Ave.  Professionals looking for a good happy hour  on Mill Ave.  I totally love when a new place opens up because I have a fantastic workgroup that I can't wait to try your place out.  \n\nWith that said, we walked ALL the way from University...huff, puff, huffying..to the north side of Mill Ave. to check this new place out.  Lucky for us happy hour starts at 3pm.  Ok...we worker bees start at 5am-7am, because our counterparts are on the east coast. So, we all get off between 3pm-5pm.  \n\nLoco Patron had great HH specials.  Beers were cheap and the marg's were inexpensive.  The marg's were okay.  I am not a fan of sour drinks...they were nothing special.  Chips and salsa were comp...nice touch.  The service was okay...even at 3ish.  I really don't recall anything that made this place special, we brought such a large group and it was ok.  The place was able to accommodate our seating arrangement.  Not sure if I will come back.","Really disappointed. Bad service, subpar food.","ok place for HH,Stopped in before the fireworks,Cheap prices on beer and HH food,$4 for 6 wings carrots n celery not bad,had habenero mango(not hot at all)Servers were attentive enough,not a bad place for HH.Bill was $13 for 2 big beers n wings","There wasn't much to like about this place except the location is  RIGHT AT the light rail. The music was annoying (live \"bad\" band), the drinks expensive and sour. I like a margarita served in glass, not plastic. I felt like I should have been poolside or at a sporting event. Didn't try the food and won't be back to see what that's about.","Went in after work around 4:30 pm on a Friday had a cold beer in my hand in less than 2-3 minutes did not eat there but the staff was friendly and not a bad place to grab a brew with you bro's after work.","Great location, decent food, but really noisy restaurant/bar on Mill Avenue!  The service was incredibly slow too!","Best restaurant near Rio Salado and Mill for US Airway employees.  The wait staff is superb.  Fridays have patience but no place can handle all of the work staff lunch within 30 minutes on a Friday.  The girls learn your orders and never make a mistake.  Great food and Service.  What more do you need?","I have been coming here since this location opened but apparently they fired all their waitresses. Taco Tuesday is a big thing for Tempe, yet somehow Loco only has one waitress serving all of the tables. More than once this has happened. One time I had to wait 40 minutes for a couple tacos and it was not busy.  Horrible horrible service. The bartenders are always good though. I suggest never ordering food, although their tacos are good and cheap on Tuesdays, and that's why they get 2 stars.","The place looked like a great time because of the ASU game. We loved the bartenders.","As a someone who regularly goes to Loco paton in Scottsdale, I have been to this location a few times and the service really sucks, the guys behind the bar spend all their time talking to whatever girls are on the other side of the bar. It is no wondering that this place is always pretty quite even for happy hour with this kind of thing going on. It's pretty frustrating to have to deal with. I went back as I wanted to make sure it wasn't me but the others in my group also noticed this issue. The food is only so so also.","Nothing special.  Wandered in on a weekend afternoon and it was all about the game(s)... So our service was fine, but not really friendly or attentive.  Tips were obviously going to be made at the men tables, oh well.\nWe read the reviews about the crispy tacos and they were ..... Okay.  So that was disappointing.\nAll in all, it was okay, with the other restaurants in this neighborhood, we could have chosen much better!","Nice place on the end of Mill. Pretty good food and drinks. Also plays pretty good music. \n\nNot atypical for Mill Ave it's certainly meant for the under 30 crowd. Prices are ok, maybe a little on the higher side. But I enjoyed the meal.","Great service, a lot of TVs, good food. Fun place to stop and get a drink. They have some great drinks. Big Servings. Really can't go wrong.","Nothing too crazy here from what I see.  I gather it can however, get a tad bit wild during the weekends and especially around ASU.  \n\nOverall, food was okay at best.  The salsa that came with the chips had too much lime.  Tasted like lime juice and the chips were store bought.  \n\nI ordered the crunchy fish tacos.  Crunchy indeed it was, but again what's up with the lime.  I added a little bit on my tacos and again it was too much.  The guacamole sauce atop wasn't bad, but my tacos were overly seasoned already.  The crunchiness was there along with the cabbage mellowing it out; that was a nice welcome.  The rice and beans were out of a can as expected.  In the end, probably come for drinks but that's about it. - Enjoy!","Spent the evening here for the ASU/UofA game. Couldn't have been happier. Great atmosphere, service and food. I spend a lot of time at the Scottsdale location, and while there is a different vibe, I think it's a perfect fit for the Mill Ave college crowd.","The food here is really good for bar Mexican Food.  The crunchy tacos are the best.    The wings are good , but get the salt and pepper wings.     The staff is always friendly and they have a bunch of hot people working there could use another girl or two behind the bar, but all the dudes are ripped.    Catch a Margarita from Jeremy, Lance or Jacks and Monti  make a good duo and help with all the drinks.   If you like hot dudes, strong drinks, good beats, and lots of TVs for games.  Go see the guys at Loco Patron.        \n\nFree Chips and Salsa always a nice bonus.    GREAT HAPPY HOUR !!!","Some bars treat their food menu as an afterthought. That isn't the case at Loco Patron. Fajitas, quesadillas, salt and pepper wings...all very nice. Perhaps my favorite meal at Loco is brunch, though. I love their divorced eggs with enchilada sauce. It pairs well with their habanero bloody Marys.\n\nDrinks are reasonably priced and service is outstanding. I hosted a pretty large group at Loco Patron on a football saturday. The restaurant was very busy, but we still had outstanding service. No one in my party had an empty drink in his/her hand for very long, which is quite impressive given the crowd and the propensity for my friends to consumer alcohol. Long after that event, I'm still having people say what a great time they had at Loco.\n\nIn short, my favorite place on Mill.","This Loco Patron location just opened this week so take this review with a grain of margarita salt. They could very well improve.\n\nI'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months, so when I saw it open I had to take a look.\n\nMy first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar, but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar, saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers, and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws, napkins, and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place, not big enough for a huge crowd, but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.\n\nI sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu, both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good, mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It had the right color, but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there, which is never a good sign.\n\nI ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up, I don't know. In any case, it was edible but not at all remarkable. \n\nWhen the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish, overcharging me, but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.\n\nMill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places, all with their own charms, and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year. That said, I'd welcome improvements that prove me wrong. The ball is in your court, Loco Patron.","This place has low stars but in all honesty its not bad. 3 dollars dos x all the time sounds good to me. As a avid train rider, it literally drops you off at there door. Tons of monitors to watch NFL and they have golden tee.Service was kinda crappy and there was a despute over the bill but the manager worked it out."],"business_id":"DJg1loBuRmAYJMTmzFvOVg","name":"Loco Patron","categories":["Bars","Mexican","Nightlife","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I love this place! Their carne asada combo buritto is soooo yummy! I love their salsa too. I do have to say that I have had days that I went there and the meat was a little bland  and dry, but for the most part, it is usually delicious!! Give it a try if you love mexican food, you won't be let down!","Best Carne Asada street tacos!!!! They are consistently good, fresh and fast. \n\nI haven't tried any of their other tacos, but from looking at other patrons plates, it seems this place is good across the board.\n\nThe neighborhood can be sketchy, but I've never had an issue.","Boulder highway is not exactly a food mecca, but at least one item on the menu at Pepe's tacos deserves mention. That would be the Machaca burrito - shredded dry beef mixed in with scrambled eggs, onions, peppers and tomatoes. This combo was perfectly cooked and their was not ounce of grease at all.  The burrito also had rice inside and i opted to leave out the beans and every bite was glorious. Fresh cold radishes were a good side and I also loved that the chopped onions and cilantro combo was available at the salsa bar, which is basically just a normal salsa bar. Machacha is a tough dish to master, but Pepe has got it down pat.","This place is legit. I grew up in LA and this place makes the closest thing to what I get in Cali. \nThe Nachos: they make it right, no fancy melted shredded cheese, they use the melted, runny oh soo good glowing orange cheese sauce. \nThe Tacos: Carne Asada is done right, good flavor and nice texture, they chopped it up in small bits so they are easy to eat. \nI live across town and still drive out here cause it is that good.","Awesome $5 burritos and AWESOME juice selection.....pineapple! hell yeah killer late night fare. 3.7 stars","I love three things in life:  My mom, my bulldog and Mexican food...perhaps not even in that order (sorry mom!)  Because of this unhealthy obsession, I found myself cruising to the eastside of Vegas for the first time in ages (oh is this what Boulder Highway looks like?!?!).  Pepe's Tacos has won a number of the Review-Journal's \"best of\" awards over the years and I decided I need to see what the fuss was about. \n\nWell to quote my homie Bill Shakespeare \"It was much adoo about nothing.\"  Much how I still continually wonder how Cuba Gooding Jr. has an Oscar Award, I must question what Vegas-ites were thinking when voting for Pepe's.  To be fair, Pepe's is fine.  In fact, the tacos I had were pretty tasty and the other food I'm sure is good too.  Prices were reasonable and the place is open 24 hours.  The salsa bar is also above average.  The best however?  That's a stretch as I think Roberto's is still a notch above and I'm sure there is even better out there.  Pepe's does offer some unique meat choices like cabeza and birria that one can't find at Roberto's and their taco special Tuesday thru Thursday is a great value (4 tacos and a soft drink for $6.95).  \n\nSome of the other reviews of this place seem a bit harsh as the place does it what it needs to do for being a hole in the wall Mexican taco shop.  Award worthy?  Probably not.  Lunch worthy?  Anytime...especially if my mom is paying (sorry again Mom!)","THIS PLACE IS CALLED PEPE'S TACOS!!!!!!!!\n(There's a big hint as to what you should be ordering right there in the name...and it's not Pepe.)\n\nOrdering a burrito at a taco stand is the same as ordering a steak at a seafood restaurant...This is not a Mexican RESTAURANT...it is a glorified taco stand and you should treat it as such. I have never ordered anything other than the breakfast plates or tacos here, nor will I ever! \n\nSome of you remind me of the girl I stood behind at IN-N-OUT who was asking them to make her a chicken sandwich.\n\nI have not eaten at all of the taco places in town but of those I have tried Pepe's is the best. They have the most choices of meat for your tacos, the shells are always nice and soft but never fall apart like the stale ones I have run into other places. AND they always ask you if you want the extras (onions, cilantro, and salsa) on the taco. So if you think there is too much of these things on the taco just don't get it and add them all yourself from the salsa bar.\n\nThe lengua here is the best. I like mine finely chopped because it is a rubbery texture, and most places leave it in large cubes, the carnitas here are nice and moist, whereas when I've had it at Roberto's it is always dry and is not nearly chopped or shredded enough.\n\nThe star of the menu for me and for those of you who appreciate it, is the best cabeza tacos I've had in Vegas. It is perfectly oily and greasy and tasty just like head meat should be. \n \nGo on Tuesday or Thursday for the taco plate special: $6.95 for 4 tacos and a drink...and get at least 1 cabeza (if not all 4)","This place is terrible!  First, I had a hard time just placing my order because the girl kept interrupting me.  Then, after a long wait, I get my order, but they screwed it up.  Then, they give me this dirty cup for my 'chips and salsa' (which is a ripoff) and give me a dirty look when I ask for another.  Then, I have to wait and wait and wait behind this woman loading up for winter at the worst salsa bar I've seen this side of the border.   For all the trouble, the food wasn't worth it.","Holly cow this place sucks! First of all I was hesitant to walk in because someone had been shot there a couple of days ago. I orderd three tacos, carane asada, carnitas and pollo. They all tasted the same with a small flavor... the salsa sucked to... it felt like I was pouring lame tapatio in green and red slasa on my taco. The service was ok, but this place did not sell me. Not coming back.","The tacos are really tasty! I found this place by accident and it is such a find. The food is really good from the tacos, burritos, chips, and sauces. They have deals on certain days of the week but they are not very expense in general. Good food decent price. The wait is never that long either.","I am not sure why this place has such a high rating. The burrito (super burrito) carne Asada is no bigger than a Taco Bell $2 burrito. The carne Asada is very bland and dry. Don't waisted money on chips and salsa as they give you a cup and send you to the free salsa bar and your entree already comes with chips. ( wish they would have stated that earlier on) . The only reason for 2 stars is cleanliness and ordering time were both good and the salsa verde is in the top ten. I may try another location as I feel this one may not be to par with the original.","Ordered their Thursday Special of 4 tacos & a drink. I love \"carne al pastor\" so my tacos were Al pastor. Loved how well seasoned the meat was since I'm always having a hard time finding ones who aren't over seasoned or under seasoned. Tacos come with double tortilla and fully loaded with cilantro and onion & salsa of your choice. Pepe tacos never fails in authentic Mexican food spots and loved the fact they are open 24/7","Great AUTHENTIC Mexican fast food!  Carnitas tacos, Carne asada tacos comes with rice & beans.  Looks like an average chain, but is outstanding!  Worth a can ride if you are staying downtown/Freemont.","The picutes look tastier than the food actually is. The first time I went was the mini tacos. yuck . i left hungry. I'm all about mexican food but they had more onions in there than meat. maybe it was just my tacos that were gross. The carnitas tacos however were so good. I'd order those again. definitely. the chips and salsa were so gross.. my bf and I ALWAYS finish the basket.. NOT this time. we left the whole basket there. stale ass chips w/ watered down salsa. Yet I will say this place is always busy.  The 2nd time I went I was hung over and craving menudo. I got it to go and they packed it nicely with red pepper flakes, oregeno and it was good but not great. extremely oily, more than most menudos i've had lately. I wouldnt order it again. Knowing how many calories I'm consuming there... I'd rather go nxt door and eat @ Weinerschnitzel. :)","Had the goat meat for the first time and LOVED IT. Did find a small bone so be careful but the flavor it worth a second try. The staff was nice and willing to help me understand what words I didn't understand on the menu.","This place is close to my house- closer than either Tacos Mexicos or Robertos, so it's on common rotation at my house. My boyfriend prefers to get a carne asada super burrito while I tend to try either tacos or different burritos. Their lengua & carnitas are good, but I found lots of sharp bones in my birria, which ruined the experience for me. Their super burritos come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, rice and beans plus the meat of your choice for 4.75, about the average. Their burritos are large and filling, making either a hearty meal or two lighter ones. Their chile relleno burrito is a little more, but  fairly tasty.\nBe warned: their nachos are crap. You can get much tastier nachos a mile or so down the street at either the Roberto's at Russel or the one in the Sinclair station by Indios. \nRefills are not free but I always get my food to go so that's not an issue for me. I don't know how stringent they are about it, but they have signs warning against sharing drinks. \nAnother decent burrito shop in Vegas. Nothing so outstanding its worth driving across town for, but cheap and filling if you're in the neighbohood.","Luckily, I grew up eating this food because the owner is MY MOM! :P\n\nI'm pretty particular when it comes to authentic mexican food, and by far my mom's food is the most authentic I've had in Vegas. \n\n AND I'm not just saying that because she's my mom.. I'm saying it because I'm mexican and i know GOOD mexican food! \n\nI live and work in Brooklyn now and coming back to Vegas and eating my mom's food is always a special treat. My favorite dishes have always been the taquitos de pollo and the carne asada soft tacos. I can never find carne asada better than Pepe's Tacos. \n\nIf you've lived in Las Vegas and like real Mexican food and haven't tried Pepe's Tacos, You're missing out!","There's California Taco Shops and everyone else. It's just fact of the matter. If it wasn't for my wonderful, amazing, absolutely fantabulous wife I would have never thought twice to stop at Pepe's. Prior to going in I thought this had the chance to be one of the all time worst Mexican food joints I've ever tried. Holy guacamole was I wrong! This is the only taco shop in Vegas comparable to my SoCal roots. \n\nThe first positive sign when I walked in was that this place had a juke box full of Spanish music - and it was blasting! There's nothing worse than walking into a quiet taco shop or one that's playing heavy metal (yes, that has happened). The next positive sign was that a majority of the patrons were of latin decent.  Another good sign was that the walls were all neon colors. White walls at a taco shop? No bueno. The last positive sign was that everyone who was finished eating had absolutely demolished their plates. Spotless, all were members of the clean plate club. Nuff said, I was a fan.\n\nNow bean and cheese burrito's are the staple of my taco shop experience. If they pass this test they are guaranteed to have a repeat customer for life. If they fail, they never get another chance, they do not pass Go, and they certainly do not collect any additional money for me. Pepe's passes the bean burrito challenge with flying colors and oodles of cheese. They have the best bean and cheese burrito in Vegas. I've even ventured out to their quesadilla and tacos. Absolutely awesome as well. Their tacos aren't that Taco Bell/Del Taco nonsense either. Small and on corn tortillas, the meat is chopped fresh, ingredients are all fresh. They also have a really good salsa bar. \n\nMorning, noon, or night you won't regret a trip to Pepe's Tacos.","after being spoiled with real Mexican food in California, I became obsessed with finding places that served those damn delicious tacos. so, on a past trip to las vegas, i finally discovered a restaurant that did.\n\ni got 2 carne asada (beef) and 2 birria (goat). soft, juicy, and jam packed with flavor. very authentic in my book.\n\ni should have topped my tacos with more cilantro and onions, but was too ashamed because of the long line behind me. the sauces i took on the side were really good too; a green and red salsa.\n\nthe wait was long, but i didn't mind. i just couldn't wait to eat.\n\nfyi: they do take out also, so be sure to call ahead if you're in a rush.","I finally gave this place a chance. I been a few times and never stayed and ordered. FInally, gave it a chance when I saw they have a 4 Taco and a Drink special for $7 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Granted its a little pricey but very well worth it. Its very clean inside and the menu pops right in front of you. Big bold yellow board lol. They have the typical menu you see in most places like Roberto's, Fausto's.....etc. They have the radish, carrots and salsa right by the register which makes it nice after you order. Decided on the Taco Special, 4 tacos and a drink and a side of refried beans. You get to choose your meat. Had one order with Carne Asada and another order with Chicken. They topped the tacos with Onion, Cilantro and salsa. Very liberal on the Cilantro onion. Which is a good thing. They were fast and wrapped my to go order. I got home and we ate. Awesome flavor and no fat on the meat. The onions and cilantro popped like flavor crystals in your mouth. The salsa was pretty good. Not spicy as I would of liked, but decent. This is the way street tacos should of looked and tasted unlike Tacos El Gordo. That place was garbage and I'll never go there again lol. The beans were very good. Not over salty and had a great homemade taste to them. Almost like my moms. I hope the beans stay consistent because I plan to order those again and hope this wasn't a fluke lol. All in all, very good and I can see why this place is always packed. Until next time, Let's eat!!!","I'm long overdue to review Pepe's, seeing as I've checked in enough times to warrant a cot in the back.  This place serves the *best* street tacos in Las Vegas at a great price.  \n\nOnce inside, the friendly staff does a good job keeping the place clean, and the salsa bar stocked.  They also always have a large portion of spicy carrots and chopped radishes.  The red salsa has a nice heat with great flavor.  I would take it intravenously if I could.  And here's something else unique about Pepe's:  Free refills on Horchata and fruit drinks (holy crap!).  That right there is one of the best values in town.\n\nThe tacos themselves are glorious.  I almost always get the chicken tacos with the 3 taco special which is served with beans and a smattering of chips.  The carne asada is also *very* good, though the el pastor is just kind of \"meh\".  What I love most about this place is the consistency; the tacos are always delicious, always hot, and always made exactly the same.  This is in contrast to some other locations *cough* Rainbow and Flamingo *cough* where the product ranges from palatable to \"Dear god, did one of the cooks find an old horse dead in the street on the way in to work?\".  I would seriously eat here 4-5 times per week if my cardiologist hadn't threatened me with an anesthesia free heart procedure if I didn't cut back.  This is one of my \"go-to\" places in Las Vegas for friends and visitors alike.\n\nSome find the location (Boulder Highway and Flamingo) to be questionable, but just think of it as dinner and a show.  On the plus side, this location seems to attract a surprisingly attractive group of prostitutes, so bring the kids and play a rousing game of \"Spot the Hooker\".  It's fun for the whole family!","This place sucks they can't get an order right 2 times in a row and overcharged me for my meal.","This is a very popular (Why?) casual restaurant where you order at the window and wait to be called to pick up the food.  We ordered a total of 4 street tacos; 3 with dried out pastor and 1 with tasteless pollo.  Our plates included industrial taco chips, tasteless Spanish rice, ugly refried beans.  I did enjoy the complimentary carrot and onion escabeche.","Pass by this place many times so thought we'd stop as it seems it's always busy....the tacos were GREAT....will definitely go back!!","This place was my favorite till I ordered the Super Nachos it tastes like Taco Bell but worse.  Fake cheese sauce, meat, beans, guacamole and sour cream.  Hardly edible to choke down.  No tomatoes, no onions, no REAL cheese, zilch.  Seriously they must have pounds of shredded cheese and they used plastic cheese sauce instead for nachos. Most of the food is good would've given it 5 stars if they didn't mess up something so simple.","I have seen this place many times and decided to make a stop. What I found was a menu that had more than your usual taco and burrito. That's right, I ordered Birria. Goat. Let me tell you, the bowl came with lots of meat and the broth was good. Add the rice with some onions and celantro and every bite was great. The place did not smell greasy. The guacamole was freaking fresh and buttery with no seasonings to add with it. I have tasted the burrito and loaded nachos and it's not the same as others. I was satisfied. I hear this place gets busy so come early.","First visit to Pepe's Tacos. Had the super nachos. Was great only thing I would change and its just personal preference I would not put as many beans. Also had Beef Taquito plate. These were the best I tasted in Vegas. They were made fresh. Wife had the Birria (Marinated Goat Meat). She had the soup version. Since I don't ever recall eating goat I took a taste test and almost wanted to trade dinners lol. Mom had the usual Carne Asada Burrito which again I tasted and again I have no complaints. This was my first visit and it will not be my last visit guaranteed.","By far one of my favorite taco places in town!\n\nI love it so much that I come at least once a week for lunch! I either order your basic tacos (yum) or the gordita. \n\nThe gordita, carne asada with everything is a huge meal. I am so stuffed when i finish it, but it is so worth it! \n\nThe staff is very friendly and it is everything you would expect from a taco shop. It reminds me of my days in Mexico and eating street tacos :o)\n\nThey should start a taco/ gordita punch card, after 10 get one free!!!","If you got the late night quasi-authentico mexican craving, then Pepe's is probably the place. Not the greatest or the tastiest, but for being OPEN INSIDE 24 hours, the night crew sees plenty of action. I usually get the Carne Asada Tacos, about a C+, and sometimes a Chile Rellano Burrito (tonight was pretty good, a B+, but usually a C-). My roommate loves this place and frequents it often: me, once in a while. To me, it is one step up from a taco truck.","Finally found a GREAT taco shop! I passed by a few times & never stopped but I was craving taquitos & menudo after a hike today. I was in the area so I decided to give it a try! Yeah I hit the jackpot! Absolutely delicious authentic mex food yum! This will be a regular stop for me from now on!","The taco are delicious here! A lot on the menu to choose from! A bit of good selections of sauces and drinks too! They have some taco deals on certain days too!","I'm just going to make it easy for everyone.\n\nVegas\n24 hours\nOff-strip\nCheap\nGood\nFree horchata refills\n\nComparable to LA taco places? Maybe close. They do have a location in Downey which I have yet to try.\n\nAdios amigo!","This is a great little place.  Excellent variety on the menu, and the prices are good.  There are 8 meat choices, including goat and fish.  Nice salsa bar, and several drink choices, not counting the normal soda fountain.","There are soft tacos, hard shell tacos, burritos, torta's, burgers, quesadillias, as well as a lot of other stuff.  It's open 24hours and there are several locations.  I come here fro the soft taco's.\n\nYou choose your meat, today its carne asada, then there are onions, cilantro and choice of hot sauce.  I also tried the gorditias, a fried corn tortillia pocket with again your choice of meat, I got the carne asada, onions, and cilantro.\n\nI enjoyed the soft taco's, but the gorditias were over fried, they were very hard and difficult to eat.  \n\nFor a quick snack or meal, this place rocks!","ate here today. i ordered a super carne asada burrito w/ chips and salsa. the meat was too chewy BUT it had really good flavor. as usual, i wasn't into the refried beans at all but everything else in there was good. when my order came up i went to grab it and was confused when i saw chips on the plate with my burrito as well as a whole separate plate of chips. my guess is that chips come with the burrito, which is something i'm not used to outside of the bay area. so that definitely separates this place from the others in town. they also gave me an empty cup with my order of chips which was obviously for salsa but there are cups at the salsa bar so i don't know what the point of that was. i saw it when i walked up and thought \"oh they must give you a special salsa you can't get at the salsa bar when you order chips and salsa\" but the cup was empty. (i don't actually care about the chips and salsa confusion, that shit was delicious and the more chips the merrier. i'm just bored and felt like boring you with my chips and salsa thoughts) also, i dug the flat screens playing a dvd of people making chile rellenos. made me want one.","Stupid singing rat :) ...the entire reason I ever tried Pepe's Tacos was because the stupid jingle is so darn cute.  What is it about a singing bobblehead rat that makes me crave tacos at 2 am??!  It's like this Pavlovian thing with me...\n\nAnyway, Pepe's is okay in my book.  It definitely fulfills my late-night Mexican food cravings more than, oh, say, NASTY Roberto's Tacos does (see inflammatory review).  I usually get pastor for my meat choice.  It's a little chewy but pretty flavorful.  I'm not so keen on the beans, but whatever.  It's a pile of beans.  It is what it is.\n\nI haven't ever come away from Pepe's feeling like I had the meal of my life, but I also don't feel like I've had scary mystery meat either.  It's decent.  The rat is cute.  Trust me, his little bobblehead is engaging in some pretty powerful hypnosis...if you stare too long, I bet you'll end up at Pepe's too!","Taco truck brought indoors. Meaning - YUM! They have the full fare - tacos, burritos, etc. All freshly made on the spot. Portions are grand. Tasty. The salsa bar is a little sparse (two choices, some radishes and cilantro) - but still fresh and tasty. We spent under $20 and ate until it hurt.\n\nSkip the Bell, go for the real thing.","My first time having a Lengua Burrito and it definitely won't be my last. The staff was friendly, place was spotless, and my food was not only good but generous. My hubby had the Al Pastor plate and had to bring some home which never happens. This place is beyond great.","I stumbled on to this place when I was trying to find a nearby Church's chicken (don't go to the one near here btw) and I just got to say the street tacos are delicious!\n\nWhen I first moved here, every taco place I tried was just awful and flavorless. \n\nThis place really hits the spot if you are looking for a good carne asada taco.  They are a bit on the pricey side, but you can't find better nearby.\n\nThe salsa is always stocked and fresh.  The staff is friendly.  Definitely recommended.","Clean store, food is yummy! Large portions, this is a win, win! Fully stocked salsa bar, burritos are huge, carne asada fries (sp) are amazing! You don't wait long here and the staff seems pretty happy and helpful...","The tacos are really good and the burrito is big enough for 2! A little pricy for Mexican food but it taste good!","Pepe's Tacos makes a great torta. They start with a soft roll, and add your choice of meat, beans,lettuce,tomato,avocado,and salsa. Mayonnaise also comes standard, but I skip it since the sandwich doesn't need it. (I ordered the carne asada torta)\n\nThe beans and rice are average-- nothing too special. My son ordered a cheese quesadilla and really enjoyed it.

{"reviews":["Worst Steak Tacos...EVER. \n\nTasted like marinated cardboard served in newspaper. Really and I don't normally give restaurants bad reviews.","LOVE THIS PLACE! I continually order the same thing, but I tell myself I will one day try something else :-). I do not agree with another reviewer who said that their steak quality is not good, I actually think it's QUITE good for the price and expectations you would have for this type of restaurant. Quality service.\n\nI've been there MANY TIMES and WILL RETURN!","El Pastor is really great! The staff is friendly, the food is authentic and very well made, the portions are a good size, and price is certainly right. Compared to the late Taqueria Guadalajara, just down the street, it comes up a bit short with its ambience and charm, but it makes up for it with plenty of space, and everything else already mentioned. I've never been disappointed here with any menu item!","I agree with Mio, it's not authentic but you probably wont find anything better in Madison.  The salsa was not spicy, the chips were stale.  The chile relleno tasted like it had been fried last week, the tostada had chewy meat on it. The beans were good but heck I eat the beans at Taco Bell too.  Everyone in Madison raves about this place and either they are natives who have never had a decent taco in their life or they are just settling for what is available.","The prices are average but the food is above average. The portions were generous and everything was well made. \nAlthough the seating area seems generic I would have given 5 stars if the service had been better.","I'm kind of surprised I gave this 2 stars a few years ago. Although I can say I still don't find a lot of the menu items overwhelmingly good - there is one simple item that is absolutely stunning here, the Chimichangas. The avocado one and spinach ones I get from time to time are what really sets this place on a pretty regular delivery/dine-in option for me.","I am constantly on the search for great Mexican in the Madison area and I was needless to say based off my 1 star, a little let down. \nNothing special that I could put my finger on with this hole in the wall.\n\nI ordered my usual, hoping for a great steak taco topped with some true Mexican cheese, and I was given something nothing close to what I wanted. \nEl Pastor, you are claiming to be authentic Mexican right? Why are you not using authentic Mexican cheese and spices? Unacceptable.\nNot to mention, the steak sucked. Not flavored at all. Straight up tasted like it had been cooked hours before serving. What are you trying to pull here? There were like 3 other people seated and it was 2pm on a Saturday. Take the time and grill me up some fresh steak. Not cool. \n\nI don't even know if I should start with the mess of beans and horrible rice thrown on my plate. Seriously, take some time and make it look nice. But I guess if it ends up tasting like it did (horrible), it might as well look the part too.\n\nOverpriced \"want to be Mexican food\" is what I call this. \n\nI was told by a work friend that this place was pure Mexican food heaven, and now I have to look this person in the face and say, \"Your taste in Mexican food sucks\". \nThanks El Pastor, you have made a soon to be awkward moment for me!","TacoQuest 2013 hits a rough patch\n\nNeeding to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out of town for my daughter's basketball game, I dropped by El Pastor for some carry out nourishment.  \n\nI ordered a trio of tacos: the pastor, the lengua and the aguacate.\n\nThe verdict:  Exceedingly average.  While better than the slop served by Taco Bell, it is well below the quality of the tacos I have recently enjoyed at America Latina or Los Gemelos.\n\nThe $1.99 aguacate taco was a big tube of goo and impossible to eat on the go.  It was a puree of avocado and refried beans topped with lettuce, tomato and onions.  Any attempt to pick it up would result in the unsupported end dumping the contents on my lap. Even with a healthy dose of salsa, this dish was bland and uninspired.\n\nThe $1.99 lengua taco has had numerous flaws.  Unlike the aguacate taco, there was a great deal of textural contrast, but not in a good way. While most of the meat was tender and well seasoned, every other bite yielded a morsel that had the texture of well-chewed bubble gum, not what I wanted to encounter on my virgin foray with beef tongue.  To make matters worse, the roughly diced onions that topped this taco had an extremely sulfuric taste that overpowered the rest of the dish.  The last problem I had with this taco was how it was packaged for my carryout order.  It was double wrapped in paper and foil, so the corn tortillas were well steamed when I opened up the packaging and they disintegrated when I tried to pick it up.  The one positive was that generous amount of meat filling.   \n\nThe $1.99 pastor taco was the best prepared of the three tacos, but that was the only thing going for it.  The pork filling was generous in quantity and but again under seasoned.  I did not detect any of the pineapple that usually provides an accent to this dish. The salsa I received with my order did not help things out much.   It was similar to the bottled salsa I find at the local Piggly Wiggly (and that is not a good attribute for a Mexican restaurant).  \n\nSince this was a carry out order, I cannot comment about the service, other than the hostess was courteous and my food was ready to go within five minutes of ordering it.","Boring.  This place was recommended to me by several people.  And I want to stop talking to them now.  It was a complete let down.  \n\nFirst, of all, the prices?  What?! Three tacos, rice and beans $9?  No thank you.\n\nSecond, the tacos were $1.50 extra if you wanted cheese.  Then it was mozzarella cheese?  Gross.  If I wanted mozzarella, I would eat Italian.  \n\nThird, the food was ok.  Nothing special.  Nothing amazing.  The salsa they put on the table was sweet and hot.  No one wants to eat that.  I had chorizo tacos and they were just ok...just ok.  \n\nThis is what Mexican food is for people who know nothing about a good taco.  Harsh?  I know.  But the truth is the truth.  And my tacos were terrible.  I have used \"ok\" probably about twenty times during this review.  It got two stars because the service was friendly.","A second visit at 8:30 on a Monday night yielded good service, generous portions, and a great plate of chicken enchiladas rojas topped with a tasty cheese. The beans and rice were just as good as on my first visit and the little salad of iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and sliced onion was fresh, crisp, and cold.\n\nI'll definitely be back.","Whenever I try out a new Mexican restaurant, I always get a Chile Relleno because this reflects most accurately to me the quality of the kitchen.  Too many places just put some fake cheese on a bell pepper and hope you don't notice. \n\nLet me say it was a solid chile relleno. Great melty queso oaxaca, the poblanos had just a touch of heat, and the eggs were stiff enough to hold up even though I got it to go! Good stuff and freshly made.\n\nThe easy part is what they messed up though!\nI got an al pastor burrito and was very disappointed.  Al pastor should be nice and crispy, like it just came off the trompo. This meat though, was likely sitting in a serving bin under a heat lamp for hours.  Too bad after such a promising start.","I think someone else said, \"Solid, cheap Mexican food...\" and I can go with that too. Mind, that's a compliment in Madison, where bad or indifferent Mexican that's toned down for the locals abounds. \n\nI'd go back to el Pastor for one main reason: the rice and beans were good. If you can get this right with me, you will do ok. El Pastor delivers with rice that is lightly seasoned and dry on the plate and beans that have a little texture rather tahn a pasty mess. Good job guys.\n\nI had the \"Taste of Mexico\" combination with a chile relleno, a pork taco, and a tamale (chicken, though they don't specify on the menu). The chile relleno was good and cooked nicely, but was not topped with ranchero salsa. This was unusual but still good, and allowed me to use that salsa they provide for your tortilla chips and that proved a better combination. The tamale was fat and heavy with meat which was a high point. However, the taco was a little boring and I was unimpressed -- too much fat and not enough spice.\n\nThey have Pacifico both in bottles and on tap, which is a nice bonus. The menu is priced fairly and service was good; I just wish the food had a little more oomph...I'll go back and try some other items, such as the enchiladas mole. Until then, el Pastor is a fine stop if you're hungry but I wouldn't make it a destination.","Service was fine but the food was pretty mediocre. I had the verde enchilladas and they were just rather meh. Too much cilantro and otherwise rather bland.","I visited El Pastor a few nights ago and was a bit disappointed.  I had bookmarked it based on a few reviews and finally found the time to go for dinner.  I ordered the chicken fajitas which are usually a hit in most places.  I don't know what it was but I didn't really enjoy it.  I think maybe it was because there wasn't really a Mexican flavor, who knows.  Either way, the fajitas were def not a hit.\n\nI will be back to this place though.  They have a large menu and it's possible that I ordered the one bad thing on the menu.  Also, they have a bar; one that is separate from the actual restaurant.  I can't discount this place until I've truly experienced their bar.  Only a monster would do that and I'm no monster!\n\nI would give this place 2.5 stars for now but look forward to updating my review after another visit.","Solid cheap Mexican food. Yummy margaritas. The chicken and pork is better than the beef. Beef quality is actually not great.\n\nI suggest the fajitas and burritos. You'll have leftovers.","I love tacos. Plain and simple. And that is how I like my tacos too; plain and simple; your taco meat (or vegetables for you non-animal eating people) with onions and cilantro. El Pastor gives it to you just like that. The tacos I ate yesterday were a 4-5. That is the truth. I was hungry and I wanted tacos. They themselves were brilliant. However, if I am going to rate the entire overall experience I am giving my experience from yesterday a 3/5. Maybe it was because I was crabby from being up until 4 am, but I felt like I was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive. When I arrived to El Pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us, and I actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress. For 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as I did. \n\nI do believe my linner? Lunner? (lunch and dinner?) was the same as the man-friends. I think we both had the pork, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Bless those tacos. I would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand-out star. It was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature. It was slightly more charred than what I would have liked, but hey, it was still pretty darn good. \n\nWill I be back?\n\nDuh.\n\nBut will it be anytime soon? Probably not, as I am hearing of this new taco hot-spot on the east side that I believe needs to be checked out soon.","I live close to La Mestiza on Madison's west side, but I'd rather go to El Pastor. It's quieter, the staff is friendlier, and the food is great.\n\nI've had several things off the menu (all good) but my favorite, by far, is the whole fried tilapia. It is exactly as billed - a whole fish, lightly floured and fried to perfection. It's fiddly food, to be sure - you're picking around a carcass. But it is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. The fish comes with your choice of rice and beans, or salad and fries. Both options come with tortillas on the side, so you can make your own fish tacos, if you like. \n\nThe margaritas are great - and are 2-for-1 on Wednesday evenings. They also have a variety of Mexican soft drinks (including Mexican Coca-Cola, made with sugar). And beer, of course.\n\nMy dining companion and I have been here so often, in fact, that we have a code for when one of us wants to go to El Pastor. We just say, \"Let's go eat a fish.\" We always leave sated and happy.","The excellent food more than makes up for the lack of ambience. My favorite were the tacos- chorizo, cabeza, lengua and pastor. The menudo was really good, too. Will definitely return.","I have been to El Pastor plenty of times but haven't had the chance to review it. The fact that I have been back many times should be a tell-tale sign that I enjoy their food, but let me explain why I am a fan.\n\nI am Mexican-American (Chicana) and I got some delicious, authentic Mexican fare made by my wonderful mom while growing up, so if I go to a Mexican restaurant a second time, it has to be good.\n\nEl Pastor is honestly one of the only Mexican restaurants I go to in Madison when I am craving some yummy tacos or some mole.\n\nMy personal favorite are their tacos de lengua (cow tongue for my adventurous eaters). Sprinkled with onions and cilantro, they are simple perfection. I also enjoy their chicken flautas, gorditas, and anything covered with their mole. Don't forget to wash everything down with their sweet horchata (flavored rice milk)!\n\nOf course nothing will compare to mom's home cooking, so I can't give them a 5 star, but man am I hungry after writing this. Yum!","This place rocks.  Service is a challenge at time, but the natural food MORE than makes up for it.  Price can't be beat, either.  Owner Lino is a hoot, and really cares about the product he serves and the customers he serves it to...","This is one of my standby places to eat. The lengua and cabeza tacos are always great, and super cheap too. I've never had bad service there.\n\nI find it to be sort of halfway between taqueria-style and Meximerican. Which I have no problem with, whatsoever.","Had the marinated pork burrito.  The pork was very good - juicy and flavorful.  The rest, however, just wasn't good.  The tortilla was noticeably sweet - an interesting touch, but it just didn't work with the rest of the ingredients.  Rice was a bit acrid, as well.  Despite the good reviews I've seen, it's unfortunately a place that I probably won't be going back to.","My favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I think Taqueria Guadalajara has better food in general, but I prefer El Pastor. The tacos are just as good and it is easier to get to and always easy to get a seat; and the tacos are fantastic! The staff is very welcoming, making it easy to come back regularly.\n\nIf you order one of the meals, get an extra taco a la carte. They are too good to come in here and not have at least one.","Some of the best tacos in town.  No frill restaurant that serves up great food at great prices.  Love their pastor taco as well as their chorizo tacos.  Very clean but sparse restaurant","Tamales are excellent!  Staff is friendly and the place is pleasant.  I had the taco dinner with an extra tamale to go.  The rice and beans are authentic and I really did like the tacos very much.  The only complaint I had was their hot sauce really wasn't hot enough for my taste but all in all, I will be back.","The tacos here are fantastic. Super fresh meat, cilantro, cheese, etc. They are really friendly there, and also make a good margarita.  The steak tacos are my favorite. You can taste the homemade deliciousness!","Tried this place out recently and found the food to be fresh but not a lot of flavor.   The hot sauce was very good though.   The chimichanga was the best.   The Tacos and burrito were ok but the chicken was a little dry.  I would go back to try again.  The staff was friendly.","We eat here ALL the time. The food is always great--authentic Mexican--definitely not TexMex. Staff is always super friendly and the guacamole is delicious, as are the tacos!\n\nThey serve breakfast too!","The mole enchiladas were pretty good, I'd go back for those. I also liked their salsa - was different. The pastor taco was just okay.\n\nIt's a clean restaurant and isn't in a bad part of town. $2.50 beers is a plus. Overall, just okay.","This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. The feel of the place and the food seems very authentic. But it is also just damn good.","I ate here only once, but there were really top-notch tacos, and cheap.  Highly authentic.  Very fresh ingredients.  The meat was cooked just right.  The chips and salsa were also top-notch.\n\nI am eager to return here to try more options.  But this place offers great tacos for cheap, and that's enough to keep me coming back.\n\n=)","We had a second gift certificate to use, so we went back, for lunch this time and stuck to the mainstream of the menu with a pork chimichanga and a pork burrito, both of which were enormous and pretty good.","Very disappointing. I was here once before for lunch and the place was packed and we were all happy with our food. this time the place was almost empty, but since it was raining, I figured, don't worry. I should have gone with my instincts. A previous reviewer recommended the Lamb Barbacoa, but I was not impressed with it. It was greasy and bland. Served with a huge piece of gristle about 5-6 inches long. The rice was boring and the beans thick and gluey. My husband had a quesadilla, but it also was only ok, and very bland. the best part of the meal was the $2.50 dos equis which was ice cold and very refreshing.","Great tacos.  Great service.  Kind of a dive looking place.  I recommend giving it a shot though.","I just want to mention that the caldo de res here is really very good.  I pack away a whole bowl.  I've had caldo de res other places, and this one is particularly fresh tasting.  The beef is nice and tender, the broth is flavorful, and vegetables are fresh tasting.  \n\nI don't claim to be an expert on the dish, but of all the places I've eaten at in Madison, it's my absolute favorite.  I'd order it again, and again (and in fact I've been doing that).","One of the best places to eat meat at in Madison, it's all really tasty.  But jeez louise stay away from that huitaloche load of disgusting crap.  Service is also a little slow here and I had to ask a few times for another drink.  But the food is good so it's worth it.  Just stay away from the gross corn fungus!","We go to El Pastor a lot.  We like the chips, we like the salsa, we like the 2 dollar dos equis pints, and we like the atmosphere, which is not too clean and not too dirty, but just right.  (The only thing that we miss is a tv playing spanish language soaps).  \n\nI almost invariable get tacos, with el pastor as the meat.  $1.75 each.  Typical taco.  Corn torilla.  Three will fill you up. Comes with onion and cilantro and lime wedges.  \n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the shrimp soup.  For $8.00 you get a piping hot bowl of shrimp (probably like 10-12) in a spicy shrimp flavored broth.  Make sure to order the shrimp whole, heads, shells, and legs and all.  Sure, it's messy eating them, but the shrimp remains tender and juicy, and you can also \"suck the head,\" which sounds bad, but really, it's delicious.","This place is pretty straight forward. It's very much where the local Madison resident population hangs out/gets their food. I could see the food being less consistently good at times just because the place seems very informal. \n\nThe price is right though and it hasn't bit me yet. Portions aren't too shabby and they have everything you might need.  Take a ride on the wild side, head done Park St. and give this simple but more authentic joint a chance.","I appreciate they have a large variety of vegetarian fares. In addition to normal bean filling; they have spinach, avocado and mushroom as options. The prices are cheap -- even cheaper if you order off the ala carte menu. Sometimes when you go at night, the servers can be hard to catch. The food is OK. I'm not a huge fan of the salsa/chips. I like the spiciness of the salsa but the chips usually seem quite salty. Despite all this, I still go here from time to time because it is quite cheap, dependable and open late.","HUITLACOHE!!! HUITLACOCHE!! THEY HAVE HUITLACOHE and it's delicioso.  Otherwise known as corn-fungus, this is a delicacy I have only learned about in my foodways courses and read about in the pretentious Gourmet magazine.  It's damn delicious in quesadilla form.  Subtle mushroom-like base w/ a slight touch of acidity and an even slighter touch of garlic.\n \nTheir melt-tender lamb barbacoa was rich and satisfying.  The orange cake my friend ordered was much the same -- it had fresh rind and icing layers so thick and fluffy. that I had to do everything in my power not to stick my fingers into it.","Yes , it is better than other Mexican restaurants in Madison. But please don't expect the most authentic stuff. It's good food, but there isn't so much I can rave about.  OK margarita, ok tacos  - the meats on the tacos were little on the dry side, and I wished they had more homemade salsa rather than the bottled hot sauce.  Good volume on plates.","We've had dinner there 4 times and never had a bad meal. Prices can't be beat, service is super fast and friendly and the place is spotless.","For those of you who complain Madison is bereft of Mexican food, I instruct you to check out El Pastor.  It's amazing authentic food where you will probably have to know at least minimal Spanish in order to interact with your server. Get away from downtown, and go here."],"business_id":"EwxURzkF_rhj6cVP7lxPhQ","name":"El Pastor","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Seriously this was terrible, a real shame as I had heard that the original location had some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  My husband and I love authentic Mexican (not just the cheese and sour cream loaded places you find around town), so the menu looked promising,\n\nBUT...don't waste your time here.  My chicken was inedible and my husband's soup was really watered down.  Plus the service was atrocious for a place that was not busy when we were there. Shame.","I came in and it was in mid day so it was completely empty.  The server was very nice and attentive.  It was a fantastic quite spot to sit down and hide out, but the food wasn't what I expected.  I honestly didn't really understand the menu and in my experience that either means the food is amazing, or just ok... It's definitely a more gourmet Mexican spot.  They have a huge tequila section I might be back for, but not the food.","The ten courses for two special is PHENOMENAL and just might be as good as it gets for Mexican Cuisine in this area. You can't help being delighted with all the bountiful flavorful tasty plates that give you the feeling you were on a tour along Central Mexico. Everything  we tried was delicious and our dining companions were also thrilled and impressed with the well crafted food. (This now is a new favorite of theirs too.) Many other great Mexican cuisine can be found around town but what's here at Los Sombreros it's a finer dining experience with a very comfortable attractive dining room and shaded patio and very attentive service. \n\nI thought a few things to go wrong since this was their first weekend open and the multi course menu requires above average service but to my surprise things went well like clockwork.\n\nFor $75. the menu per couple went like this.\n\nChips and salsa\n(2) Corn Chowder Soups\n(2) Crispy Hibiscus Tacos\nFig and Panela Cheese Salad\nCrab and Mango Salad\nSnapper and Corn in Chipotle Balsamic honey sauce\nTrout and Cauliflower in lemon butter caper sauce\nChicken Breast stuffed with goat cheese, huitlacohe in chipotle tomato sauce\nChile Rellenos\nPork Chop with tamarind mole\nHouse Made Ice Cream\n\nYou should plan the ten course event to take over two hours to enjoy.","I am so excited that Los Sombreros has opened a new location closer to me in North Scottsdale.  For years they have been serving the best upscale Mexican food in the Valley and with the new location I can enjoy it more often.\n\nI was here today for lunch and everything was great.  The salsa for the chips was amazing.  My chiliquiles were delicious and the service was fantastic.\n\nI can't wait to come back for happy hour and dinner in the very near future.","A great menu that isn't the standard cookie-cutter fajitas and burritos mexican menu.  A lot of very good choices.  The staff has the feel of a family run business with everyone very friendly.\n\nWe went to the North Scottsdale location and we must have caught them on an off night however.  The kitchen was backed up even though the restaurant was less than half full and it took 45minutes to get tacos and pollo con espinacas although people seated after us were getting their meals quickly.  When it came, the vegetables in the espinacas were still icy although the chicken was warm so i'm not sure the order everything was put together.  My water glass was cracked and even though I pointed it out early, it wasn't replaced.  \n\nOur waitress was very apologetic for the delay and the cracked glass, but no consideration was made on the bill and for a restaurant charging a premium, I expected more.  We probably won't go back.","Los Sombreros (downtown Scottsdale) is one of my husband's favorite restaurants but due to its location and small parking lot, it wasn't one of our frequent dining destinations. Now that a location opened up down the street from us in North Scottsdale, we are so happy! We came here opening weekend and were surprised to find it wasn't packed. There were a few diners outside enjoying the lovely patio and a smattering of folks inside. The actual inside has tons of room - a front dining area that leads into the bar, a side dining area, and a back dining area. We originally wanted to sit outside, but after finding it a bit chilly we decided to move inside. We sat at a nice booth that faced the bar and open kitchen. This location's design choices seem drastically different from the Downtown location - more of a family friendly/Mexican chain feeling. This isn't bad in anyway, just different. It is still very nicely decorated and I loved the tables and large glass mirrors. \n\nTo start, I ordered the margarita de coco (a coconut margarita) and my husband ordered La Damiana (a margarita with Damiana liquer).  Since it was opening weekend, it took a long time for our drinks to arrive. My husband wasn't too impressed with his drink, but he wanted to try something new so that's on him. I knew perfectly well how a coconut margarita should taste and mine wasn't very coconutty. The pineapple juice really overpowered the drink. It was good, but not what I was expecting. After our drinks arrived, complimentary chips and salsa arrived. They were good to munch on, since we were hungry and couldn't wait for our meals to arrive.\n\nHalfway through our drinks (and we are slow drinkers) our meals finally arrived. I ordered the Puerco en Chipotle because that is my favorite - slow cooked pork in a chipotle sauce with a sprinkling of cheese on top. Simple, yet oh-so delicious. Normally, my husband and I would order this and split but we decided to get our own dishes that night. Good thing we did because the portions were much smaller than the portions served up at the downtown Los Sombreros location. It was still delicious. My husband ordered the Camarones Al Tequila - which are shrimps in a chipotle cream sauce and some bacon. It was uber yummy. My husband really enjoyed his meal. \n\nOverall, our food was fantastic and tasted the same as the Downtown location. Taste-wise, it met our expectations. The drinks and service could use some improvement, but it was opening weekend. Our server was extremely nice and constantly smiling. She even apologized for the slowness and gave us a coupon to use for our next visit. It was a very nice touch and we will definitely be back.","Los Sombreros was truly a WONDERFUL place. We went for lunch, and got the chips with salsa and guacamole, which was the BEST POSSIBLE STARTER!!! For a main course, I got the Carne Asada (beef) and it was amazing! It was the perfect portion, but I had a lot of chips and guacamole, so it may be a little small,or even too small, depending on your appetite. \n\nAlso, we got the Chicken Emoulada, which was delicious. It was not too filling, and even a little tangy, but in the best way possible. It was perfect! \n\nThe service & atmosphere were wonderful. We *thoroughly* enjoyed ourselves!!","I'm a sucker for amazing GUAC, chips and salsa! Atmosphere is great, food is even better!","Food was not good and expensive for the little amount we got. The worse part was the service! Our waitress didn't come to our table for over 15 minutes after we arrived. Luckily the food came out fast! Only to wait over 30 minutes for her to come back to us so we could ask for the check! Ridiculously bad service and they weren't even busy! We will not be going back... I don't recommend you wasting your time. Oh and we are still hungry.","The food was good. Not what you'd normally find in a traditional Mexican restaurant.  The guacamole was excellent. Great selection of tequila. Chips were fresh, green sauce was great.","My husband and I went last night at 4:30pm for an early dinner since we had an appointment at 6pm in Cave Creek. We never thought that the service we be so slow we wouldn't get out of there until 6pm so we weren't able to make our appointment. Even though it was the day before Cinco de Mayo the place was almost empty so I couldn't say why the service was so slow. Despite how long it took the food was amazing. The chicken mole enchiladas was delicious and make sure you save room for desert. They make all the deserts there even the ice cream. The chocolate cake was delicious with a side of their ice cream that the waiter described as a brown sugar molasses flavor; very good. Great Margaritas too! The menu is not your standard Mexican restaurant fare and the prices are a little higher than the usual too. We will return but only when we have ample time to spare.","My wife and I left this evening (Cinco de Mayo) without being served or approached 15 minutes after seating ourselves in the bar. When we got up to leave the manager/bar tender asked where we were going, and when I told her wasn't any staff to wait on us on this usually bust night in Mexican restauarants she said ahe didn't have time for any complaints...totally non-professional.\nNeedless to say, we won't return in the future.","Other reviewers have pointed this out, but I must be emphatic - Los Sombreros does not do ANY of the standard Mexican dishes done in the other Phoenix Mexican restaurants.  To reiterate - Someone used to our Mexican food will not find one entree on Los Sombreros' menu that they have had before.\n\nIt is with this new found reality that my family found itself desperate to find the waitress before she filled our drink orders so we could leave.  I really do have some of the most closed minded eaters around me.  No cheese crisp!  No fried logs covered in enchilada sauce!  We all looked and looked through the menu and even though I'm pretty familiar will most of the dishes, even I couldn't find something that I thought they could do.  \n\nOur waitress appeared with our drinks (yikes!) so I explained our ignorance and asked her for recommendations.  She was so understanding, and immediately asked each person what they usually like and directed them to something on the menu that filled the bill.  Every person at the table loved what they got, and they even sent over some chips and salsa to help us feel more at home.\n\nI had the chicken with mole, and it was seriously the best mole I've ever had, even in Mexico.  It was light, whereas mole can sometimes get very rich.  The tacos the others had were excellent.\n\nBy the way, the wine list is by far the best I've seen at a Mexican restaurant.  I had a really good glass of Pinot Noir.","Stay away. Salsa is bland and under seasoned, portions are tiny and expensive, rice OR beans (not both), chips and salsa cost extra and include only one refill on chips. If you want to get nickel and dimed and leave disappointed, this is the place for you.","Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a bartender. I went to the restroom and upon my return found my husband still waiting to be seated.  After a few minutes together, we asked the bartender if someone was going to seat us or if we should seat ourselves.  He replied \"oops, sorry about that, I can seat you\".  We should have left right then and there because for the rest of the evening we were treated as though we were invisible. . Our waiter was disinterested in us, and we waited over 45 minutes to get our food on an evening when the restaurant was not full.  The food was OK., we did enjoy the wine selection.   My husband and I are accustomed to high-end restaurants and thoroughly enjoy mom and pop restaurants. We would not spend money here again.","This restaurant is amazing! The staff always has great customer service! I love the chile rellenos!!!","We love Mexican food. In a bad way. Why does a place with amazing food (espinaca queso, crispy potato tacos, steak tacos) less than 10 minutes away from our house with a beautiful (albeit overlooking Gold's Gym) patio get 2 stars?\n\nNo water. Requested multiple times from both server and food runner. Server clearly remembered I had asked for water about 10 minutes before and got really weird. Just apologize and bring water! Don't stay silent and awkward and avoid us!\n\nI'm a habitual 20% tipper to a fault...not this time. This place lost me as a potential regular.","We three went last night and all had great meals withe excellent service.\nGreat wine and draft beer list.  We will be back often and tell our friends\nTo also go.\nWe have been back three times and I take back my original review which was 4 stars.  My wife's cheese enchiladas had no cheese, and I mean none.\nMy tacos and quesidelas  were mostly over fried with almost no filling.\nThe last two visits were similar.  They also have a weird wine list, a Pinot was \n$50 for a bottle and 25 for a glass?  Also the glasses of wine are a third the\nPrice of a bottle for a very small pour.\nWe had high hopes for Los Sombreros but will go back to our favorite,\nthe Spotted Donkey for A Mex fix.","Small menu with high prices, I know it's Scottsdale however paying 3.95 for chips and salsa is crazy. Staff was not very accommodating, when asked to seat is on the patio the waiter informed us it was to cold hmmmm it was 74 degrees outside. Will not return ......","I'm not sure where to begin but from the moment we walked in the door the service was terrible. Our server had absolutely no personality and nor did anyone we saw. Then the food, mediocre at best. My tacos were not chicken, (which is what i ordered ) and for $47 (including tip) for LUNCH with NO cocktails I think it is safe to say we will never be returning. I work down the street as a hairstylist and unfortunately will be sharing our experience. Any Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa automatically looses points. What a disappointment.","Awful place... First off the wait took forever to get seated around 3pm on a Thursday. The hostess seemed unsimpathetic to our concerns. But we decided to continue on, the margaritas we had were way to heavy with the sweet and sour. The food came out 35 minutes after we ordered, again for the time it should not have been busy. The server didn't even apologize and as well didn't being the additional hot sauce I requested. In short, this place really isn't worth your time.","I was thrilled that a potentially great mexican restaurant moved in near me.  Just wished it turned out to be more thrilling.  Had problems with service, completely inflexible.  Kitchen managed to muck up a basic of quesadilla order.  Server was incredulous that we might want that fixed.  And she questioned what a quesadilla should be, tried to take the kids menu from my 5 year old boy so she could read & verify WHILE he was coloring it with crayons.  Couldn't she just get herself  another menu?  They really need better servers.  And it was pretty expensive for a lunch time meal that was really just mediocre.","Corn cake souffle with mole was DELICIOUS!!!!  We also tried the chips & salsa (I didn't love the warm salsa, it was a little tomato-y for me), the hibiscus quesadilla which was outstanding, and the three x crispy taco deal with three mini crispy tacos - we tried picadillo beef, potato and chicken.  I didn't try the chicken, hubby loved it, I loved the other two - potato is soooo good.  Nice selection of Mexican draft beers.\n\nNow for the downside....They missed the Pozole on the order (didn't charge but still annoying).  The crispy tacos, we asked for the $2 for three flavors deal, they charged us for three full orders at $8 each.  They charged us for the chips and salsa despite the fact that the woman taking the call said it would be waived for the difficulty they had in taking my order.  \n\nWe will be back, just careful to review the bill/order from now on.","Finally authentic Mexican in north Scottsdale!\nBtw to Review/Maria if you really lived in Mexico you'd know they don't have an inch of Cheddar on their beans!!","I am a foodie that loves to cook. I like to eat food that takes effort. Food that takes hours to prepare. This is what makes paying premium prices at a restaurant worth it to me. This restaurant is totally worth it! \n     My husband and I started with the corn cake soufflé, it was amazing. It is light fluffy, sweet and spicy. We then shared the Crepas De Mariscos and Puerco en Chipolte. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Crepas but when they arrived I was pleased to see two large \"burrito\" sized crepes on the plate topped with a green sauce. They were generously filled with fresh fish, shrimp and crab. They were so good I let out an audible sigh when I tasted them. The  Puerco is basically carnitas in a really good chipotle sauce topped with cheese. The pork is so tender and has a slow roasted smokey flavor. It was so good. The food was top quality.\n     Our server was friendly and attentive during the meal. I am really looking forward to trying more dishes.","Awesome food! Come here if you are an adventurous eater, as they have some not-so-average choices! Hibiscus tacos, corn chowder, and crab and mango salad are only a few of the many delicious items! Our waiter was very caring and descriptive of the food, and we definitely will return!!!","I love the downtown Scottsdale location and was ecstatic to see one open closer to where I live.\n\nThe new place still feels very new, has plenty of parking and lots of room.\n\nThe food, just as with the downtown location, is superb.  I love Tex-Mex but it's a real treat to get an authentic Mexican meal like what Los Sombreros serves.  The guacamole is wonderful and I've never been disappointed with a dish.","I went to Los on a slow Tuesday night.. it took over 5 minutes for someone to take our drink orders and another 5 minutes to get our drinks.  The waitress had to cone back two times to clarify our order.  We ordered tacos and the chicken enchiladas.   Both were incredibly bland, no flavor at all.  When they are charging 17$ for a dish I have higer expectations.  The best part of my meal was the beans.   Ins short.. bad service.. boring food.. I will not be going back.","I tried Los Sombreros for lunch with a few coworkers last week, and we did not have a pleasant experience.  Some of the food was really good, some food not so great, and the service was possibly the worst I have ever received at any restaurant in my life.\n\nFirst impressions on arrival where that the restaurant appeared to by very nice and clean.  I liked the atmosphere, but perhaps the very low number of patrons should have been an indicator to run.\n\nAs we reviewed the menu, we started to notice some things.  They charge for chips and salsa, and there is only one free refill of chips.  Also, at least on the lunch specials, we noticed that you are forced to choose between either rice or beans as a side.  We were shocked.  We had never seen this before at a Mexican restaurant, and this was our chance to run, but we decided to stay and try this place out.\n\nAs the waiter arrived to take our drink orders, we indicated that we would need separate checks.  He said that it's not possible to split our check.  Now, this was not our first visit to a restaurant, so we knew that it was possible to split a check.  We proceeded to challenge our waiter on this.  When we did, he said that he would have to open a separate table for each person in our lunch party and that our food would come out at all different times because of the busy lunch time rush.  Keep in mind that at this point two or three other tables were occupied in the entire restaurant.  We finally gave in and just went along with the single check policy.\n\nWhen we received our food (all items from the lunch specials), we noticed that the portions were extremely small.  It was almost laughable.  Since we had to choose between rice or beans, we all chose beens.  Everyone agreed that the beens were not good at all.  It's amazing... I mean they figured our how to mess up refried beans.  I think everyone was disappointed by the quantity of food.  Especially for the price.\n\nI must say that the enchilada (although only being one enchilada) tasted really good.  That was until I was about half way finished and I found a hair in it.  I was still hungry after only finishing half of my small portion, but I decided that was enough for me.  I notified my waiter that I found a hair in my food and that I was finished eating.  I asked  him to remove my plate.  A couple minutes later, a woman came back with my plate and questioned me about the location of the hair.  When I could no longer locate the hair, she insulted me by saying, \"Was it an invisible hair?\"  Someone at my table chimed in to tell her that they had seen it too, so she took the plate back to the kitchen.  When I thought that was all over, she brought my plate back a couple minutes later at asked me if the hair was from corn.  She then proceeded to show me a hair from a corn husk that was mixed in with the food and asked me if that was what I had seen.  It wasn't the same coarseness or color at all.  She finally went away and never came back, and fortunately they didn't charge us for that plate.\n\nWe had high hopes for Los Sombreros, but things just didn't pan out.  Although some of the food items were great, portions were low and prices were high.  Service was lacking entirely.\n\nFor anyone thinking about trying Los Sombreros, I would certainly recommend staying away.\n\nFor anyone at Los Sombreros that is reading this, It's not to late to change your ways.  Stop being so cheap with your portions and work on your service.  Even though we didn't like the portions, the beans, the hair, or paying for tortilla chips, we could have had a pleasant experience if the staff had handled things differently.  Your restaurant seems unorganized and the people there are unhappy and it trickled down and polluted our entire experience.","Ok, tonight was our last trip to Los Sombreros.  We have gotten take out a few times since my last review and the order has been wrong each time but this is the last straw.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of items and when my husband went to pick it up he asked if the order was checked...\"yup, everything is in there\" he was told.  When he got home it was missing almost $20 worth of food.  He called quickly and we were informed that there is no manager there tonight - a Saturday night with no manager?  The guy was short with him on the call and offered to credit us for the missing items, how generous!  When my husband asked him to make sure the manager hears about this the guy hung up on him. \n\nThey had to credit us back in January but needed two calls to get that done and they kept the tax, a small but annoying detail.  Let's see if they actually even credit us for tonight's mistake.\n\nThe food is pretty good which is why I still give two stars but it doesn't make up for the experience.  They just can't seem to get it together with their staff.","Honestly the best Mexican food in town. I grew up on the border and have a lot of family in Mexico. It is hard to find food this good even in Mexico. Try the Chicharron Quesadilla. It's not like most quesadillas at all, it has a mild savory flavor that is difficult to describe but I promise you won't regret it. \n\nThe Lamb Adobo was my favorite entree. It is a very large portion so come with an appetite. Oh and I can't forget to mention the guacamole, it's hard to get such a simple dish right but they nailed it. \n\nAll in all a great dining experience and this new location has a much larger indoor dining room for those really hot or really cold days when sitting on the patio is not really an option.","This was soooo disappointing.  Service was terrible. We watched 3 parties walk out because they weren't getting any service.  The Mexican food was authentic, but our adult daughter commented that the vegetables looked like what she buys at Traders Joes, fresh out of a bag-and these tasted like it.  The staff pressures you to order appetizers.  If you order appetizers the chips and salsa are free but if you order 3 meals all over $20. each, plan on paying for the chips...it does state free when you order an appetizer on the menu, but seriously that is just silly!  Another Scottsdale business that won't and shouldn't make it!","We have always enjoyed the 'original' Los Sombreros on Scottsdale, so were quite interested to try the new one closer to our residence.  It was not disappointig with interesting takes on Mexican dishes and a huge lists of Tequilas.  The atmosphere is different, but the seating is much better and the more open interior is more appealing.","Omg.  Please save your money and stay away from this place.  Waited forty five minutes before we got our food. Ate two basket of chips because we waited soooooo long. \nEveryone around us was waiting. We paid $87 for three people and we had no alcohol .\nThis place is expensive and it sucks.","It is seldom that I feel like I will never return to a restaurant under any circumstances and this is one of them.  The restaurant was expensive and the food was terrible.  The salsas were bordering on tasteless, the entrées huge.  I had the regular chili rellenos.  They were swimming in a tasteless sauce, with very little chili taste.  I managed to get one of the huge rellenos down.  My side was refried beans.  They were good.  We took the remaining relleno home for my husband's lunch the next day.  He ate the beans but he also could not eat the Relleno, and it hit the garbage can.  I seldom write reviews but I feel that this is one that needs to be written.  Please read the other other reviews.  I found them to be true even down to the chip in the salsa bowl.","We won't be back.  My husband ordered the 3 tacos with ground beef and raisins. The server came back and said they were out!  So he ordered chicken tacos.  Bad choice!  They were fried to a crisp and the small amount of chicken in each one was as dry as could be and NO flavor. When the server finally came back to our table, she didn't seem to even care.  He told her he wasn't paying for it and didn't want anything else.  I had the crab and mango salad for $12.95. It  was very small and just ok.  Also had the corn souffle which was not that good.  We expected delicious food and great service.  Never happened!","While I heard they have other locations, this is the very first time we went to this (new) location on Northsight Blvd. Amazing food.  I struggled with the menu because it is so different from Mexican restaurants. I don't remember what the name of it was but it was shredded pork with a chipoltle sauce with corn tortillas. FABULOUS! Service was good and the place was very busy. I am looking forward to returning!","Visited Sunday afternoon after a round of golf. Dishes were stacked up everywhere and it took 10 minutes to get a beer.  Another couple that came in the same time as us walked out. Soft tacos were tiny and lacking flavor. Salsa was also lacking flavor and served in a chipped bowl. Refried beans were homemade and the best thing about the experience.","I rarely am motivated enough to write reviews but after tonight's awful experience at Los Sombreros, I felt I must.  We are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this \"new\" restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.  How sorry they are.\n\nOur party of 7 called at 6:30pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.  \"No problem\" and \"what's your name?\" was the response and off we went.  We arrived and the greeter/hostesses were rude and said they didn't show a reservation for us.  We pointed it out and they said they couldn't honor/accommodate us.  As they saw our jaw drops, they akwardly walked off and tried to piece something together.  They offered us a table in the bar OR said we could wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.  Having 3 kids with us, we elected for the bar.  We were seated at about 7:05 and then, after having our orders for drinks/food taken at 7:25, we still didn't receive anything (drinks or chips) until 7:45.  The drinks were wrong.  My 6-year old daughter ordered lemonade and was told they had it;  they didn't and brought her a Sprite.  She said she had ordered lemonade and they said they didn't hear her. They said they had \"homemade\" limeade so she agreed.  When it arrived at 8:00, she tasted it and told us it tasted weird.  My husband tried it and said it was margarita mix.  Seriously?   After numerous drink mix-ups and having servers come and verify and re-verify certain food orders, they brought our food out at 8:15.  Things were looking up!  \n\nThe food:  2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.  One of us got the carnitas and he said it was just \"ok.\"  The rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.  The food was all pretty cold (definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prep/service well) but we were done complaining.  It was up to them and they seemed to know we were not happy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.  Chips were good, hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.\n\nThe check:  Upon the conclusion of our meal, the check was delivered.  There was an add'l drink on there (the extra Sprite from the earlier mix up) and upon us asking, they responded but we brought you the limeade.  Well, that was on there too!  Also, the mandatory gratuity was included b/c we were a party of 7.  Are you kidding me?  The owner is there, never comes over to apologize and then they charge us for everything and include gratuity?  I spoke with the server, told her that despite her best efforts, it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.  She apologized and said she had spoken to the owner and told her but that she didn't care.  Seriously?  \n\nI will NEVER waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.  It will not last given it's current state.  They were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious breakdown in all aspects. \n\nDo not waste your time going to this location.  This place needs a manager and obviously NOT the owner running the place.  She was rude (I saw her get into it with 2 other customers) and I saw 2 tables leave.  She obviously doesn't care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.   Shameful and awful.  This review would not have been written had she come out, apologized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad situation better.","It finally hit me that this is the same place as their other Scottsdale location so we rushed over as I've had several great experiences there and knew the food was fantastic. \n\nThe choices were difficult as many things sounded great so my son and I opted to share the 10 course tasting menu which was as amazing as it sounded! My daughter ordered from the kids menu and got a generous portion that she loved too. \n\nThis is not your ordinary Mexican fare so don't come expecting a big menu of fajitas and burritos. If you want crap Mexican food like Arriba, go to Arriba but if you want great food, come around the block here and you won't be sorry.","This ain't Macayo's folks. It ain't Los Dos Molinos, either.\n\nIf your only exposure to Mexican food is Tex-Mex, AZ-Mex, or NM-Mex, you will probably find yourself dazed and confused. This is more in line with what you will find in the interior of Mexico.\n\nIt's also delicious. Try the duck enchiladas covered in a smoky mole sauce. The seafood, either as enchiladas or just as a fish entree is also excellent. The flavors of the ingredients really come through and the food isn't heavy.\n\nService is friendly and they have a great patio. Margaritas are top-notch: even the well margarita uses decent tequila.","When will restaurant owners learn that great service is as important, perhaps more important, than great food?  Just left Los Sombreros North ... first visit .... was looking for a late workday lunch.   OK food, high prices, no chips (extra charge), no water,  no ice tea refill.   They weren't even busy.  $14.05 plus $2.00 tip for me.   Still hungry ..... think I will go to Costco for a $1.60 hot dog + soda.   Never again.","We saw a great review in the  republic recently and decided to hAve our anniversary dinner here.  A big mistake!  it is expensive and the food is not good.  we ordered patron silver margaritas for $22 and they had no mix at all - just ice and tequila.  A watered down drink that I should have sent back.  it was the worst margarita I have ever had.  We could not have the happy hour price on our appetizer because we chose to sit in the restaurant section for dinner afterward instead of the bar.  This makes no sense to me because we were just a few feet away.  We ordered the soft rib eye tacos and guacamole.  The tacos were awful and full of gristle.  The guacamole was good and the salsa and chips excellent.  Service was very slow.  We ate two baskets of chips waiting for our dinner so needless to say we took half home.  Our entrees were the pork carnitas and seafood crepes.  The crepes were very good and the pork not so much - very bland with little flavor.  The rice side had been reheated many times and not fresh and was also bland.  The mixed veggie side was very good.  We sat near the patio doors and froze because they would not keep the doors shut.  Our server tried but could not answer even the simplest questions and ran off to ask someone else.  The ambience is good and so is the location but we will not be going back.  Our bill was $100 and for this amount it should have been better.","I've been twice to the restaurant both for Happy Hour, and have enjoyed pretty every item on the HHr menu, from the empanadas, tacos, corned-souffle, fig and panela salad, etc.  The tacos and empanadas fillings were unique with the chiccaron, picadillo, huailcacoche, amongst the choice of chicken and potato, but we wanted to venture something different from the average.   The tamarind margarita was smooth sweet and soury, just as I like it.  We received free chips and salsa-maybe this was different from the past.    The service and prices were right on.  We will continue to return as I'm bored with other types of Tex-Mex menus and since this menu provides a fresh and well-prepared fare. ."],"business_id":"GfsKIdURweoz-V_X0XwoPA","name":"Los Sombreros","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Came to Sabor having the California enchilada and mom having grilled chicken.  Everything was excellent. The waitress was an absolute joy.  They need to move this restaurant to Summerlin.","Food is amazing. Not like your Mexican grandma amazing but 5 star chef amazing. Ambiance is upscale and pleasant. I didn't expect it to be this fancy. Dress is casual and staff is super friendly. Prices are  reasonable for the amount of thought and work that goes in to the food. We thought the bill would come out to be twice as much which I would have felt to be worth. Try their appetizers. Only place I've seen serve real Oaxaca cheese which is extremely yummy even if your not a cheese fan.  Will definitely come again.","We were in town for a graduation & found Sabor on Yelp. We were not disappointed. We made a last minute lunch reservation for a party of 11 and they graciously accommodated us.\n\nThe service was great and the food was delicious! The food is a nod to traditional Mexican dishes. It was elegant and flavorful along the lines of Mary Sue Miliken & Susan Finiger's Border Grill Restaurants. The mole dish was great as were the imaginative salads. Lots of great options for the vegetarians in our group.\n\nLocals please patronize this restaurant so us out-of- towners can get some wonderful Latin food in Henderson! :)","After reading glowing the reviews, we figured we need to see what all the chatter was about.  I'll have to try it again to fully make up my mind.  After our first dinner I'd give it a full 5 stars, but the second trip (with friends and family) it fell flat.\n\nI highly recommend the nopales (fresh cactus) salad.  It's deliciously vinagary with diced tomatoes, corn, onion and cilantro in a light vinaigrette finished with queso fresco and pine nuts.  Yum!  The first time I got the green mussels with three cheese stuffing and fettuccine alfredo.  I could have done without the alfredo, although the leftovers made great late night munchies, but the mussels quelled my craving.  My boyfriend tried the steak enchiladas with a great spicy red sauce.  The service was great, and we were sure this would be a favorite stop in Henderson.\n\nThe second time we dined there we again had the nopales salad (a favorite across the table), but some of the other entrees fell flat.  We tried the vegetarian tacos, which lacked flavor, along with the green chili pork.  The mole was good, decent, but didn't rock my world.  The favorite item at the table were the fish tacos, which had great flavor (although the salsa was a bit too sweet for my taste).  The chicken enchilladas were fine, but lacked flavor, and definitely lacked heat.  None of the meals this time had much spice.  \n\nWhen we're looking for a nicer night out eatery we'll head back this way and update as appropriate...","We actually ate at Sabor about 3 months ago. The Mole Negro Oaxaqueo and Petite Filet Mignon were good and the Pineapple Rum with Vanilla Ice cream for dessert was an excellent recommendation from our server. We also experienced good service while we were there. \n\nHowever, I'm giving this place 2 stars because I felt their ad in the community newspaper was misleading. I currently do not plan on returning to Sabor and nor will I recommend it to my friends.","Great service, good food, and awesome desserts.  The chili verde is good but not for everbody.","1st time tonight. Great food, great service!\nGourmet mexican food at very reasonable prices. The atmosphere is comfortable. They do an excellent job with food presentation. This place has good management, you can tell they sweat the details. Funny it wasnt more crowded on a friday night though.  Also kind of warm inside too, dont know if AC was a problem. \nWe'll be going back.","Seriously the best upscale Mexican/American food I've ever had. I grew up in San Diego and I was interested to see how this would match up to authentic cuisine and it rocked my socks. The chef lived in Oaxaca for several years and what he brought back was pure bliss. Favorite dishes are the chilaquiles verdes and carne asada quesadilla. Oh and the place is stunning. Great job Sabor!","We received complimentary house made tortilla chips with two delicious salsas and a black bean dip plus small bowls containing cumin seeds and coriander that have been roasted.  We started off sharing a nopales salad (not so crispy cactus with diced tomatoes, sweet corn, pearl onions and cilantro that was dressed in light vinaigrette and finished with queso fresca and pine nuts).  Ann chose the Quajillo scallops as an entrée; scallops with a spicy quajillo chili rub that were sautéed and finished with sweet corn, caramelized onions and sundried tomatoes.  Not to be outdone, I ordered Mole Negro Oaxaqueno (a large portion of grilled chicken covered in Mom's, actually his mother-in-law's, deep brown mole and fried plantains).   We concluded this bountiful feast by sharing a flan Napolitano with homemade caramel and whipped cream.","So we were in the area and I remembered that there was a Mexican place near so we pulled into the parking lot. The place I was thinking of was gone and replaced by Sabor. The place was very clean and has a really nice bar area so we decided to give it a try.\n\nIt was early, 4:30 so the place was kind of quite..and kind of nice so we pulled up to the bar. The bartender offered us a happy hour drink menu and things were looking up. $3.00 for one of the best margaritas I've had in a long time. So far so good as we sipped our drinks and relaxed for a bit. The owner/chef Scott came out and informed us that their menu was not the usual Mexican that most people are looking for. According to him it's the type of food that you'd get in a higher end restaurant in Mexico City. Well we've been to Mexico City and he was right on the money. The chips and salsa that you normally get is replaced with a sampler platter of salsas and dipping sauces with some really cool innovations and little plantain bananas as a pallet cleanser. (Nice touch)  The sampler was awesome and really unexpected. You can really tell that they love sharing their food and like to give the customer and experience in the process.\n\nAfter the chips and salsa platter we thought we'd take it slow and try out the fish tacos. A really, really well presented platter of very fresh tacos came out. I liked the fact that the fish was not fried fish. It was fresh and really well cooked and flavorful. Rice and Black beans with a funky and tasty little cream sauce anchored the plate with 4 perfectly constructed tacos fanned out with just a wisp of of a redish orange sauce was very enticing. The flavors all blended really well and were fantastic.\n\nI have to say this was a great find. I recommend Sabor and I will make it a point to take their recommendations on my next visit. It sounds like their Mole is the specialty and I am eager to give it a shot.","My new favorite \"go to\" restaurant in the area! Love the food, love the service, love the atmosphere. I have been here a few times already and have left happy and full every time.\n\nThis location use to be the old El Jefe's restaurant but newly converted to Sabor. I always describe it as a Mexican infusion - Chilis pricing for Carabas quality. I am suprised this place is not busier than it is. It is never packed when we are there.\n\nI LOVE the queso dip. AMAZING! I seriously lick the bowl. It is so delicious. Their bread plate is so awesome as well filled with breads, tortillas ext. YUMLICIOUS!\n\nMy favorite dinner so far is the scallops. OMG - so perfectly cooked and every bite delicious. We finished with the banana foster icecream rum dish....it is so good. I have such a hard time sharing it. Next time...I am getting my own..LOL.\n\nSo, if you think you can't make it down to Sabor.....I disagree...You Mexi-\nCAN! Go now and thank me later!","I was in Las Vegas the evening of 8/1 and had a restaurant.com coupon for Sabor for dinner.  I read a few reviews about this place and I love Mexican food so I figured I'd give it a shot.  \n\nHaving family in Mexico City and spending weeks traveling around Mexico, I felt I was prepared to properly review this place.   The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza, in a location you'd expect to see an Applebees.  We came on a Sunday evening around 6pm and the restaurant had only 1 other couple in it.  I was somewhat apprehensive about this.  \n\nWe sat down quickly and were served a complimentary chips, salsa, and more appetizer.  It came with breads, and toasted spices to dip the bread in.  It was fantastic!!  We ordered the guacamole, made tableside, which also was fabulous and for the first time we were asked how sour we'd like it and we said very!!!  It was incredible.  We followed that with the Sliced Sirloin and mashed potatoes which while I ordered medium, came rare which was fine and delicious.  This came with a roasted Jalopeno which I love.  My fiance ordered the Mahi Mahi which too was delicious.  We ended the evening with the Flan which was out of this world.  \n\nIf this restaurant were open on the Vegas strip in a hotel it would do fantastic!  It's out of the way from tourists and seems out of place in it's current location.  I'm saying it's too good that it may go missed.  I go to Vegas often and will make sure to visit every time.  AMAZING FOOD!","Was in the area so I stopped in for lunch. I was alone. Ordered the lunch special. No chips, breads or dip were served. Nor was it offered.\n\nThe ginger soup was excellent. Definitely worth the price of admission. The chicken sandwich was unique and tasty.\n\nService was good but I was the only one there for at least 15 minutes. They really need to step up their game if they want to stay in business. The food was good but not sure if I'd go back due to the chip fiasco. I mean really. As soon as another group arrived, they were shown to a table and chips were served.\n\nWhy would I return with bf and friends?","This is by far the best restaurant in Henderson. Not only is the food fresh, but the menu is very unique. The service was impeccable. ! Everyone should give it a try, and support a local business owner at the same time. I had the scallops, and they were to die for. \n\nThere were only a few other parties when I was there, but I think its because no one knows about this place yet! \n\nI'd definitely go back! In fact, I'm meeting a friend there this weekend!!","I, too, am VERY disappointed that this place closed. One of the very few REAL mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. Having moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in Dec 2010, this was an oasis. Now I'll have to get any Oaxacan food (mole, etc) in LA on visits. The mole tamale appetizer was one of the very best dishes in town.\n\nPLEASE reopen, even if across town. I beg you. \n\nAnd I apologize for not reviewing sooner.","Went for dinner on a Monday night. Only two other parties there. Seemed a little odd, but we decided to give it a try anyway.\n\nThe decor was very nice. A large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. A fancy bar.\n\nWe had a Mole Negro Oaxaqueno and a Chipotle Chicken. Both dishes were quite tasty. Although I have to mention that for a restaurant with only two parties, it took a really long time for the food to come out.\n\nFelt somewhat overpriced. It was tasty, but it wasn't THAT tasty. I'd rather go to Chevy's for the price if I've got a hankering for Mexican food.","Don't let the sparse patrons deter you it just means Sabor is  undiscovered and the chef/co-owner can spend quality time preparing your meal. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my Guaijllo Scallops. The California enchiladas would not be a dish that sets them apart from others, so  I would try items more unique to their menu.\n\nThey also have a long bar with a good happy hour ending at 7.","Shortly after our arrival, Chef/owner Scott Sousa came to our table to welcome us and offer a few recommendations.  We started with complimentary housemade tortilla chips served with a trio of delicious dips - cilantro salsa, black bean and a chili sauce.  For an appetizer we chose to share a chicken mole tamale steamed in banana leaf.  Ann ordered the coconut crusted Ahi tuna served rare with a fresh coconut and pumpkin seed sauce, mint rice and broccoli.  I took the chef's suggestion and ordered Guajillo scallops; four sea scallops rubbed with quajillo (chile) before being sautéed and finished with roasted sweet corn, caramelized onions and sundried tomatoes.  We concluded the meal with a piece of flan accompanied by a rich and flavorful housemade caramel sauce.  This meal was probably a 4.5.","Went on a wednesday night for dinner at 7pm and there was one other party eating. Not a good sign to start off but i was not going to let that change my mind after the good reviews. There was only one waiter and a hostess working and you could hear a pin drop in this place. i ordered a cadillac marg. to start which was pretty good and the carna asada tacos which was brought out in a nice display. it had high quality meat and unbelivable flavor. Sabor is a little over priced for mexican food though","After reading the other Yelp reviews I had hopeful expectations to find a diamond in the rough. Unfortunately I was let down as the food was good, but not as great as Yelp advertised. \n\nWe had the table made Guacamole to start off the meal and found the flavor had a strange after-taste. I believe they added the heat with a touch of Tabasco sauce an dnot the traditional pepper flavor. \n\nFor dinner we had the Pescado Tacos which were good, but a bit on the sweet side. We also ordered the Chicken Pablano which was better and a very generous serving. \n\nOverall the food was good, but not great - and the bill for our dinner ran $50 with tip.","This is one of the best kept secrets in Vegas. Great food, big, open bar, great menu, and quality ingredients. This is the perfect place for meetings, corporate dinners.\n\nI have eaten here at least 10 times, and it is always empty because it is new.","Check this place out!\nSaw the reviews on yelp and decided to check it out. The high rating is well deserved! This is not your standard Mexican cuisine. The flavors are more unique and the presentation is top notch. The dining room is beautiful and they have a full bar. \nWe were greeted promptly when we came in. Our server, Jorge, was excellent. Very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly.\nMy wife and I shared a watermelon salad with toasted pumpkin seeds. My wife had the roasted poblano chicken and I had the tacos de arrechero. Like I said the presentation was top notch. And the food was excellent. My one critique would be it could have been spicier. But the meat was flavorful and moist. \nThere's no reason why this place shouldn't be packed all the time.  Give it a try.","Presentation was awesome, food was great, service excellent, and priced well!  Hubby ordered the California chicken enchilada with artichokes and smoked gouda, tasty rice and yummy black bean salad on a fried tortilla.  I ordered the fried calamari with mixed green salad and balsamic dressing.  Must try!","Excellent food, great service, we always love coming here.  The guacamole is sooo good as are the tacos and the cactus salad.","I have been meaning to review Sabor. \n\nThey are not your grandmothers Mexican food, so if you go in expecting some high end del taco you will be disappointed. If you are that kind foodie you are not likely to be on yelp.  \n\nThey do a fun twist on chips and salsa that includes bean dip, spices, and plantains. Which led us to believe we were on the right path.  The corn tortillas served were tasty and helped cut some of the very spicy flavor of one of the salsas.  \n\nPersonally I have eaten here three times.  The scallops were very inspired and I loved the bed of corn they sat on. The Shrimp Diablo was spicy and tasty and the mint rice was a nice counter balance.  The tropical fish I ordered was okay, the portion was too large and it was not as good as the other two.  \n\nMy husband ordered the seafood pasta(I dont remember the name) and raved about it quite a bit.  He is a true convert as he made us drive all the way back because he didnt want to eat at Agave which is near where we live. \n\nI also had a tamale which had nice texture and really great mole flavor.  \n\nThe kids had food and they both liked it and the servers were so nice to the girls.\n\nThey also have a dart board and place to kick back, possibly for happy hour specials.","Upscale Mexican in a beautiful, comfortable environment. The complimentary homemade tortilla chips arrived with 3 sauces plus 2 spices which could be added according to one's taste. The grilled vegetable appetizer with balsamic glaze was perfectly prepared, beautiful and delicious. Fish tacos were Baja-style - no deep frying here. The fish was fresh and flavorful, drizzled with 2 sauces and served with black beans. \nService was efficient, attentive without being overbearing. I loved the place -- you will too!","My boyfriend and I are definitely huge fans of this restaurant.  This place is FANTASTIC!  Boyfriend and I have been here twice and each time, we order different entrees and everything was wonderful!  The last time I was there, I ordered the scallops.  They were delicious and just melted in my mouth. Boyfriend ordered the tacos.  I'm usually not a huge taco fan but I tried them and they were awesome!  The tacos had a little cilantro/lime kick to them and were really the best tasting tacos I've ever had.   I also had the New York strip steak the first time that I went and it was also cooked to perfection and really hit the spot. The service was also excellent.  \n\nThe restaurant design from the outside doesn't look inviting but the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. There are not a lot of cars parked both times we went but that's because they only opened in 2010 and not a lot of people know what kind of hidden gem this place really is. My only advice is don't not try this place just because you don't think the menu looks good or the outside doesn't look good. Just give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised....the food is EXCELLENT.","We dined at Sabor last night and it was absolutely fabulous.  Our server, Kelly, was very knowledgable and efficient, and the owner, Scott, very service oriented and very friendly, also.  We had an absolutely wonderful meal - traditional margaritas, calamari, scallops and clams.  Everything was perfect and I can't wait to go back next weekend!  The food is from Oaxaca and it's not your typical Mexican food.  The mole was amazing!","The best kept secret in Henderson! Moderately expensive and definitely worth every penny you spend. If you are looking for typical Mexican food you have come to the wrong place. This is reasonably priced fare for a slightly more sophisticated palate. Sabor provides you with culinary masterpieces that create a whole new experience for your taste buds. I have been five times in two months and have thoroughly enjoyed each entree I've tried. While I have my favorites (the Chicken Poblano has an amazing flavor that you simply cannot forget)  my wife prefers the Blackened Arrachera. The food at Sabor creates more of a dining experience, one that you will cherish, rather than just satisfying your appetite. The chef, Scott, definitely knows what he is doing and the waiters and other staff are both efficient and friendly. Do yourself a favor, this is a dining experience that you will usually have to travel to a five star resort restaurant  and it's tucked  away in a quiet corner of Henderson.","I'm rarely on this side of town during dinner-time-hours but one late Tuesday night I was and we were craving Mexican food. A quick look on Yelp offered up Sabor and we decided to try it out. I'm so glad we did, the guacamole was amazing! Our waiter was very knowledgable and really seemed like he enjoyed working there. I will definitely return for another delicious modern Mexican dinner at Sabor.","WOW!  Is Henderson, NV lucky!  Sabor is the best Mexican Restaurant I have ever experienced.  The \"chips and salsa\" (sopas, chips, and extraordinary dips) started us off with a fiesta in our mouths.  We had traditional margaritas and they were tasty and powerful.  My wife had Tacos de Arracheta and I had Camarones Diablo.  The flank steak in her dish was so tender and yummy.  I must rave about the Camarones Diablo.  They are spicey, which I love, but all the flavor is there too.  The most delicious Mexican dish I have ever had.  I grew up near, and now live in, San Jose, CA so I have eaten a ton of Mexican food.  I pleaded with the owner, Scott Sousa, to come out to the Bay Area because we need Sabor and people would line up to pay and eat at his restaurant.  Henderson, NV doesn't know what a gem it has.  Big loss for us in California.  We will dine at Sabor as many times as we make it out to Las Vegas.  Hopefully Scott will open a Sabor in San Francisco or San Jose someday.  Until then, I will enjoy the memories and get out there as much as possible.","Wow!  Henderson - go here now.  We stopped by after reading the yelp reviews and they were spot-on.  The food and service were exemplary!  They margaritas were tangy, the dip & salsa assortment that was brought out with the chips was amazing, and our waiter was genuinely nice and attentive.\n\nI had the Cactus Salad...yum!  Don had the Guaijllo Scallops with corn...wow...both dishes were very inventive and delicious.  Portions are bog as well.\n\nWent back for lunch with a friend and we both had different types of enchiladas that were - both were yummy.  This a restaurant that deserves more business than it is getting.  We will become regulars & so should you!","It is tragic that Sabor closed. This was a gem. I'm heartbroken.\n\nThis is one of the best restaurants in Vegas.\n\nThat's a big thing to say but I mean it. If you don't eat here as often as you can, and if you love food, you are missing out on one of the most amazing gustatory experiences to be found in this city, and that includes all of those ridiculously priced restaurants on The Strip.\n\nYes, it might be far away from you, but wouldn't you drive for 20-30 minutes for one of the best meals of your entire life? Shouldn't you drive that far?\n\nI've had lunch and dinner here. The only thing that didn't work for me was the \"watermelon and pumpkin seed salad.\" But everything else was \"curl your toes yummy!\" The soups, the cactus salad, the scallops (OMFG), the mango shrimp (ditto), this is one of the foodgasm swoonilicious restaurants in Vegas. I could eat here every day, twice a day, and be happy.\n\nJoel Robuchon has nothing on the chef at Sabor. (Hahaha! I think I'm serious!) Even if you don't like Mexican food, you've still got to go. It ain't your mama's Mexican food! And with the Yelp special, this place is a steal.\n\nBe aware that they are currently only open for lunch on Fri/Sat.","I learned of this place through a hispanic friend. We went here twice and tried 4 different dishes. They were all very good. The service was attentive. The food is not the usual Mexican style and includes a good number of seafood dishes. We went before 9/21/11. The review by Gloria K saying they are closed saddens us. BUT THEY ARE (WERE) EXCELLENT !","Four friends and I decided to have lunch at SABOR today.  Sadly we discovered the restaurant was permanently closed last Saturday.   Too bad, with all the great reviews, so few people cared to try out what was considered to be one of the best restaurants in Henderson.","The food is great but the service is questionable.  I'm not sure if they're simply understaffed or just lack training and expertise.  We have been there 3 times and everytime it is so stinking hot in the restaurant.  If it weren't for the poor service I would give this restaurant four stars.","one of the best restaurants I've ever try, the food is excellent, but i order a ultimate margarita which I thought was the best margarita(price) but nothing spectacular.","The food was excellent as was the service. I had the shrimp and clams, which was absolutely delicious. The staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. They also have a great happy hour.","I took my wife there a week ago friday night.  I would rate it a 5 but the service could be lots better. It was dinner time and it was not crowded. We were seated right away but took some time for someone to come wait on us. Once the waitress finally got our drink order she did come back to check on us and get our food order. The service could have been much better considering there was hardly anyone in there.  We both ordered margaritas which were great. My wifes was some kinda fruit mango something but mine was more traditional. Small but not too pricey.  I ordered the seafood platter which was clams and then shrimp in the middle over rice. Camarones Diablo I think. It was plenty of food. Mexican food is not my favorite but this was great!  I dont know what my wife ordered and she LOVES Mexican food and she loved her food too. The service got better and the food was definitely worth it. Id love to try other dishes and dessert too. We did get the certificate from Yelp which you pay $10 and get $20 off your bill. So that was nice too. Definitely will go back but hope the service gets much better.","Phenomenal lunch! Went in with a restaurant.com certificate and prices weren't bad. Had: chile verde which was  tangy and had just the right amount of spice, queso and guacamole appetizers, California chicken enchiladas, steak tacos, and chicken quesadillas.  All were great and the service was the best we've had in a long time. Only bad part of the meal is that I'm stuffed! :)"],"business_id":"HgIqOb4R8gWy6dqwYkZfEA","name":"Sabor","categories":["American (New)","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["No matter how good the food is, when the waiter is an obnoxious twit who cannot be bothered to do his job? Here you go.\n\nI was stuck in a corner: the plight of the solo diner. My server took ten minutes to even show up, in this half empty restaurant. Barely a glance and NO WATER. I haven't seen him since.\n\nForget the entree, forget a second glass of wine. I just want out of this disaster.","It's very hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas - especially good Sonoran style - but Hecho nails it. Being from Tucson, I'm very familiar with Sonoran style, and familiar with the family who partnered to open Hecho. The food takes me back home instantly. I especially enjoyed the enchiladas banderas. Prices are a little up there but not out of line for a Vegas restaurant. Overall, great place to enjoy some great food!","I would agree with a lot of the previous reviewers about the service as I will agree it's not great.  The restaurant is really large so even though they have a lot of staff they struggle to keep up with how big the place is.  On to what I consider much more important the food: We got the tableside guacamole which was really good.  The salsas weren't to my friends liking so they made a special really hot salsa that was what my friends wanted.  For entrees we got the steak fajitas which was above average, carnitas chimichanga which was huge and tasted like a barbeque pork chimichanga which my friend liked and the tamale trio which looked good.  Overall a pretty good place just be a little bit patient","Can you say da bomb diggity!!! Excellent food and service. The food is fresh and the service from the staff is top notch. Had the bandera chicken burrito...moist meat and a tortilla that melts in your mouth. Will be back soon for surezn","I heard about this restaurant when I was visiting friends in Tucson, Arizona where I dined at El Charro restaurant.  Tucson is the Mexican Food capitol of the United States and one of the best restaurants (and there are many) is El Charro! El Charro has been in business since 1922 and for good reason.  I was so excited to see an article posted on the wall saying they just opened up in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand but under the name of Hechos En Las Vegas! I told my kids, my brothers, my sister and we had a group of 14 people very excited to finally have good Mexican food in Las Vegas.  The servers were very nice and we were excited to tell them that we were originally from Tucson and looking forward to the food.  The first sign that things were not going to taste like El Charro was the chips and salsa.  This was definitely not El Charro's salsa.  It was thick and had a hint of \"tex-mex\" in the flavor.  Then we got our menu's.  This was definitely not the menu I was expecting.  I had even called the original El Charro in Tucson and asked if it was their recipes and menu... and they told me yes.  Well, it appears to me that the Las Vegas crew thought they knew better than a 92 year old restaurant and they changed everything.  Which is ironic since our waiter told us that he previously worked at another Mexican restaurant in MGM and they closed it down.  Duh!  It probably sucked and yet they had the same crew make a bunch of changes to this Mexican food concept.  Everyone in our party said that their food was very dry.  They hardly put any enchilada sauce on the food. And my enchilada plate had some kind of pickled cole slaw/cabbage thing on it (what?) along with very dry Spanish rice and black beans.  Black beans?  This plate should have had the amazing re-fried beans that you finish eating with chips at the end of your meal because you just can't leave a drop on your plate.  To add insult to injury, our bill was $465! We had very below average Mexican food at 4 start pricing.  The only thing that was good was the guacamole that they made table side. Everything else was a disgrace to the El Charro name - at least they didn't use the real name of the restaurant they were supposedly modeling after!  Unless someone from the real restaurant comes in and changes everything soon, I predict that this restaurant won't last very long.","Amazing food! I'm a bit surprised that other people have reviewed the service as being poor. Maybe I happened to get a great waiter. If the owners/managers for Hecho reads this, I just want you to know that Dana was a fantastic waiter. If you order the guacamole, they make it right at your table and it was so damn good!\n\nNow to be fair, I don't have a lot of experience with non-Taco Bell Mexican food so I don't know if the food is objectively amazing or not. But I loved it. The portions were generous.","We made reservations here since there was a lot of activity at the MGM Grand, as I am sure there always is.  We waited a few minutes to be seated in the bar area.  Was a little disappointed since we did make a reservation.  And being it was \"happy hour\" time, most of the patrons around us were \"happy hour\" partakers.  Our server was pleasant but the service was extremely slow.  We were almost done with our chips and salsa by the time he came over to take our order.  We knew we wanted to try the table side guacamole, so we ordered that and he ran away before asking or taking our drink order.  When he came back to take our drink order, he ran away again.  We were ready to order our entrees, but he literally could only take one order at a time.  \n\nThe table side guacamole was very good.  A good amount of avacodos, onion, cilantro, tomatoes and salt. We ordered margaritas, mine was a frozen, prickly pear, and raspberry margarita on the rocks.  Both were very refreshing.  Since we filled up on chips and salsa and guacomole, we shared fajitas.  We had a chicken and shrimp combo.  You have the choice of flour or corn shell tortillas.  We got flour tortillas, and there was three small ones.  The shrimp was very good, and had a mesquite seasoning.  The chicken had some pink spots on it which kind of concerned me.  \n\nWe needed to get to a show and was looking for our server to get the bill.  When he got to our table, we gave him a card, and he disappeared for a while.  When he finally came back he said the credit card machine was down so had to take a carbon copy of it.  However when I was walking out, I saw other peoples bills being delivered I saw their's were done the modern way.  I didn't have time to ask why my receipt was the old school kind. The next day we went down to the restaurant to ask if their machine went down last night, no one could give us a straight answer.  It was a little suspect if you ask me.  There are plenty better establishments to go to while in LV.","I love this place! Food was amazing! I had the beef pizza so good I never thought I would be able to eat it on my own but it was so good I did! Haha The Guacamole Is to Die For Amazing! Service was great! Will definitely be coming back :D","I had the Beef Chimichanga and it tasted like Chinese fried rice wrapped in a tortilla that absorbed the taste of a frier that has not had the oil changed in a while.","Amazing tostada salad! I ordered it with chicken, and it was too much food. I could have done without the meat. I ordered the sangria, which was good, but it didn't come with any fruit. My husband had the enchiladas with white sauce that was amazing. Great food, but the service we got was amazing!!!!! I would definitely return.","The food was very good. The service was very bad. Rather than listing all the specifics let me just say that it was bad enough that it ruined the experience. I would try it again but never on a Saturday night when there's a big show at the MGM. Maybe when it's less busy it would better.","So we went here for dinner and we thought the food would be really good, but we were disappointed. So we ordered an appetizer and their fresh guacamole; the queso fundido and the chicken quesadilla was amazing so we couldn't wait for are main entree. The entree looked really good but as soon as we tasted it they weren't that good as the appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered Carne asada burrito with no black beans inside and the meet didn't have any flavored and inside of the burrito is mostly rice. And the rice also didn't taste like anything. The service was good because we had three server. But overall the food was disappointing.","Came here on our last night and vegas and had a great meal between 4 of us. By this point we had eaten quite alot through out the day so we each split a dish. Fajitas for 2 and Enchiladas for the other 2. That with the tableside guacamole was more than enough for us. The flavors in all the dishes were great, the atmosphere was great and our waiter was always attentive. Overall a great place and I would go back.","2 words.  food poisoning\nHusband and I visited Vegas at ate at Hecho on 5/27. We shared a carne asada .About 3 hrs after we ate we experienced severe gastrointestinal problems. My husband had non stop vomiting... so much that we spent that night and into the morning at a disgusting and dirty ER. We were bed ridden the next 2 days. Anyone else experience this?!!","I made a reservation via OpenTable for my family to celebrate Father's Day and we were seated promptly. The restaurant is really nice with modern decor. Definitely suitable for special occasions and semi-casual affairs.\n\nI had informed my family about their Happy Hour and we briefly perused the menu at the hostess stand. We requested these menus once seated, however, we were informed that the \"menu was basically all the appetizers, half off, except the Chicharrón.\" That was satisfactory. Well, until I realized that I had researched these details the week prior and the other part of Happy Hour was $5 margaritas. No one told us this information, so it is possibly only offered at the bar?\n\nComplimentary tortilla chips and salsas start your meal. The chips are seasoned nicely and the salsas (Rojo and Verde) are delicious (my favorite being the red, of course). We opted for the Tableside Guacamole ($10) made with avocado, freshly-squeezed lime, cilantro, serrano chili, onion, tomato, and sea salt. The guacamole-dedicated cart (adorable) rolls over to your table and asks how spicy (mild, medium, or spicy) you want your guacamole prior to its creation. This guacamole received my high stamp of approval! It was my mom's first time trying guacamole - I don't know what compelled her (although I like to think that my love for avocado was the influence) - and she loved it! We also started with the Short Rib Taquitos ($12): slow-cooked shredded beef, served with salsa verde, crema, and queso cotija. Crunchy tortillas and succulent meat. I'm not sure I would be able to identify the short rib without being told, but it was certainly more moist and soft than most beefs I've had in Hispanic cuisines. The taquitos lacked proper seasoning, but tasted really great with the table Salsa Rojo.\n\nMy mom ordered the MGM Grande Taco Salad ($14): Crispy flour tortilla, chopped romaine, refried beans, pico de gallo, black olives, tres quesos blend, avocado, chipotle ranch, and shredded beef (alternatives: chicken or carnitas). The shredded beef seemed like the Short Rib in the taquitos, although indicated differently on the menu. Either way, the salad was delicious! The flavors were wonderful together, the meat was so tender, and everything was so fresh. However, there was WAY too much cheese and as with all taco salads, too much fried tortilla (which I discarded without remorse). This was the best entree at the table.\n\nOther entrees at the table included Tres Carnes Enchiladas ($20), Chicken Mole Enchiladas ($17), Mesquite Chicken Taco Platter ($17), Mesquite Chicken Burrito ($18), and Carne Asada and Applewood-Smoked Bacon Taco Platter ($18). I didn't try any of the enchiladas, but my brother noted that the meats were a little dry (except the shredded beef). The Hecho mole negro was flavorful, but a tad sweet for me. I'm usually a fan of mole, but this one didn't do it for me. I also had a bite of the Mesquite Chicken taco and I did not care for it. The breast was surprisingly moist, but lacked flavor. The Carne Asada tacos was my entree and I was displeased. The beef was dry, I couldn't taste the bacon, and it was weirdly sweet. It also had an abundance of non-spicy marinated red peppers (most likely bell) that proved an odd addition. I didn't eat the second one. The refried beans and rice served with most dishes were unimaginative and lacked great flavor. I didn't eat these items either.\n\nMy dad wanted a margarita, so I ordered him the Muy Picante ($14) made with Chipotle-infused Patrón Reposado Tequila, Patrón Citrónge, fresh lime juice, and agave nectar. It had a really great smokiness from the chipotle infusion and a nice balance of sweetness.\n\nWe shared Fried Ice Cream, Cinnamon Churros, and Raspberry Tres Leches ($7/each) for dessert. The corn-crusted dulce de leche ice cream had a Oaxacan chocolate ganache center and it was very tasty. The Tres Leches (Vanilla tres leches trifle with tart raspberry compote) didn't actually taste like \"Tres Leches\" usually does, but it was a decent dessert. The churros were pleasantly soft with the perfect crust. It also featured a cream center (could do without it) and served with Oaxacan chocolate ganache and Cajeta. Loved the Cajeta because it's not nearly as thick as caramel and not as sweet.\n\nService was wonderful. Our server was very friendly and extremely accommodating. I'm a little torn about the food since it wasn't really what I expected. It's supposed to be Sonoran style or inspired (New Mexico/Mexico border) and perhaps I'm not familiar with its flavors or maybe it's too Americanized. Overlooking authenticity, I wasn't pleased with the majority of main dishes based on preparation of meats and overall seasoning. However, I really enjoyed the salsas, guacamole, and short rib (or shredded beef). These strong areas are not quite enough to carry a restaurant, so I can't say I'm a fan. Also, prices seem a little high ($32/person), but the portions are generous.","This place was ok. The food was pretty average but hit the spot when I needed it. The black beans were the best part of the meal,they had quite a kick. beef enchiladas were cool. Nothing really to write home about but if you want quick Mexican food this is the place. Oh and the drinks were weak. Won't rush back here.","Was a little hesitant since the reviews avg a 3, but I give it a 4. \nYou have to get the guacamole made fresh at your table side. We asked for it spicy, and it still could have been hotter, but oh my, it was delicious! \nThe chips were ok, but I did not like either of the salsas they put on the table.  This is why I can't give them a 5. \nI ordered the 3 chimichanga appetizer and it was good...especially the beef one. However it came with little diced onions all over it, so be warned if you don't like raw onions. The menu didn't say onions, so I did have the opportunity to say hold them. Now you do!  ;)","I have never loved going to dinner with my mother in law so much. She treated us to Hecho's and everything about the night was perfect. Excellent and attentive service. Spectacular food made exactly how asked for, and delicious appetizers! Any tourists that go through the MGM MUST stop and try it. The rolling guacamole cart (made directly in front of you) is to die for! Just a wonderful night with a full thanks to the Hecho's staff! Can't wait to eat it again!","Not sure why there are two profiles on here but I posted to the other one... To reiterate this place is awesome! Check it out and it seems good for large parties. Lots of different \"atmospheres\" available in the same space. Food was great!","This is in the space that used to be Diego's in the MGM grand. We were impressed by the service (knowledgeable and friendly), flavors (traditional Sonoran) and overall value. It's hard to find a family meal in a strip hotel these days that's good quality but doesn't set you back well over $100. Hecho is just opening and so they are working a few kinks out, but don't miss the table-side prepared guacamole and / or their ginormous nachos!","Hecho en Vegas is not your traditional Mexican food. It's a bit \"kicked up.\" Some will like it and some will not.\n\nMy favorite part is the bar and bartenders. Perhaps I'm bias toward this location because of my old friends behind the bar. I love the tequila flights and Mojito's (raspberry, blueberry and tequila). Is tequila a flavor?\n\nI'll return because I'm a Mojito freak and like the \"off the beaten path\" location. Yes, yes, and the bartenders.","Been going to this place for years, great food and drinks, ask for the 702 HOT Sauce. This is the craziest hottest hot sauce you will ever I mean EVER!!!!","Dana is the best server!!!! Friendly, upbeat and efficient. The place is great for a pre box match. The pomegranate margarita is great as are the street tacos.","Service was fantastic! Fresh guacamole made table side. Food was very good. Prices were reasonable.","A bunch of my friends went out on the town one evening and decided to give this new restaurant a chance since we were craving Mexican food. Let me just say it was a disaster! First we started of with table side guacamole made by a lady named Trini. She was very rude and unfriendly. I didn't think you could mess up guacamole but it was just very salty and not very tasty. \n\nOur server was Daniel and pardon my French but he was a douche. He was not very informative about the menu and rolled his eyes at us quite a few times. His personality was just very rude. The only standout of this place was Eric who delivered our food and even came back to check on us even though he wasn't our server. He's the only one who seemed to care about our table. Definitely keep Eric but the other 2 you could do without. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food was mediocre.","The shredded beef nachos were incredible. We ordered the fish tacos & they were way too salty. I told the waiter in a respectful way that I wouldn't recommend that dish. He saw that we didn't eat them & came back with the tacos off of our bill, no questions asked. Great service, I would come back again.","Disappointed.  Small portion for the money.  Tortillas were hard and cold.  And our server was too busy flirting with 60 something old ladies.  He didn't even offer to refill my soda.  I even had to go find him to pay.   1 star is for the ok food.   Service would get a zero","Decent Mexican food. Salsa is kinda weak. Black beans are good. Ate at the bar for quick servicio amigo.","I have been here for happy hour margaritas and appetizers two years in a row. Both visits were great. The service at the bar was exceptional and the food was much more traditional than what I expected. This isn't tex mex, people - the flavor is much more fresh and I always feel great after leaving and ready to continue my vegas tyrants. Our bartender was very friendly and maybe a bit too concerned as to whether we were enjoying the food and drinks; but that would probably be an excellent aspect to someone else. I definitely recommend this place.","I loved the fajitas. Not only was the presentation great the steak and shrimp were very juicy with lots of flavor. Server Jose was very nice and attentive. The manager stopped by and ask how things were and overall it was a place I'd go again.","Hecho is a cougar den with weird hours and spotty service. If you want some unusual people watching and an afternoon margarita, it's fine. If you want something else, there are much better options in the MGM complex.","Dined two nights in row. Tale of two cities, first night made me want to come back, second night reminding me why I don't often   Eat Mexican. And the service matched each night perfectly.","I was severely disappointed by this place in MGM. We wanted to eat somewhere different and worthwhile for our first night in Vegas and chose Hecho. Customer service was terrible. The menus are gigantic, size wise that is definitely not in terms of the options. Tables were uncomfortable. We ordered some enchiladas and quesadillas as well as sangria. Both entrees were underwhelming and the $12 sangria was basically a cup of ice with ginger ale. I've had better Mexican food at Chipotle. Not worth the time or money.","As soon I walked up the service was so friendly and the place was so colorful. We sat down and Dana was our waitress she had so much energy and was friendly helpful right off the bat. The drinks were tasty and the food was pretty amazing . I had the chicken fajitas . The hand made corn tortillas were so warm and dele icon the chicken was lean and soft. I think the highlight was desert , ordered the churros! Amazing cream filled churros served with warm rich chocolate and caramel! Amazing place it's a must visit every time I come to Vegas","If you like Mexican food, do not come here. Staff was friendly and the food arrived quick, but the food was bland and I knew at first bite that it wasn't any good","My husband and I walked by this place 7 or 8 times, and finally decided to try it one night when we felt like the walk to the Luxor for Tacos & Tequila was going to take too long (I was getting hangry, and food needed to be acquired ASAP).  We had been laughing about the serious lack of customer service we had been receiving all over Las Vegas, but when we came to Hecho, we were really please with the hospitality we received.  Roberto was our server and he was awesome.  I got the Hecho Casa margarita on the rocks, my hubs got a shot of Don Julio and a Modelo Especial.  We got the table side guac, and it was amazing!  I worked in a Mexican restaurant for 3 years, so I am pretty picky about my guac.  We asked for it to be on the mild side, and it was heavenly.  We split the steak fajitas (also amazing) and they gave us flour and corn tortillas since we preferred different types.  The steak was perfect, really juicy and tender.  \n\nWe had been thinking that the guac and fajitas may not be enough food, and we were planning on getting desert from the froyo place outside Hecho, but we were both so full that we didn't have room.  \n\nThis was the best meal and best service we had in Vegas in the last 2 trips that we have made, and we will def be coming back again when we come back to Vegas in December.  Also, for one appetizer, one entree, 2 beverages and a shot, the price was only around $68... Which was pretty cheap compared to the other places we ate and what we got for that price.   \n\nWhen we left, every person that we passed said goodbye, and thanked is for coming.  It was a nice change from the other places we had been.","Had Dana as our waitress outstanding service had fajitas shrimp and chicken incredible ask for extra tortillas. Tortillas soup very good and burrito is enormous bring an appetite.  One of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Make a reservation this place is crazy busy and you can make reservation on yelp. Great job by entire staff.","Please bring back Diego's!!! Diego's used to be my hubby's & I's go-to restaurant when we stayed at MGM. It was so tasty and had amazing deals. My how times have changed! We live in San Diego, so we have the authority to critique Mexican food. Diego's was grub, but Hecho took ten giant leaps towards \"On the Border\" status, yuck. \n\nWe went to Hecho last night and ordered the following: $7 margarita, guac, wings, street tacos, and the tres carnes enchiladas. Pretty good happy hour deals. \n\nThe drink was standard in quality, but was served in a pint glass (not used to that). The guac was not table side, but looked fresh. It was ok, big chunks of avocado. The strange thing was, it had this funky effervescence. Some strange tingly sensation! (Maybe something to keep the guac from going brown when they made it ahead of time?) still edible, just weird. The wings were really good, I would recommend them. Thank goodness we got them or my poor hubby would not have been satiated. The three tacos were also pretty standard - nothing great. The meat was sub-par but, again, edible. They could use a special sauce or salsa. The street tacos are a fairly small plate as they don't come with beans or rice, FYI. \n\nFinally, the tres carnes enchiladas - they were sad. The meats were carne asada (which tasted like jerky), shredded beef (which tasted like rope), and carnitas (which was actually really good!). The enchiladas were dry not only because the meat tasted like it was sitting in uncovered hotel pans for 16-18 hours but also because there was not enough sauce or cheese. For being one of the most hyped plates on the menu, it was just depressing. \n\nLet me say that I really like the new decor and remodel. But I wish they remodeled the place and not the menu. When my husband and I left, we discussed the changes & I asked him, \"Don't you feel like we just left On the Border?\"  \n\nThis place may satisfy some people who don't know guac about quality Mexican food - but this place, in short, is NO BUENO.","I came here last night for a private group event, so we had apps + margs & sangria.\n\nHonestly, I've had much better Mexican food. This is basically a step up from El Segundo or some other Mexican chain. I tried the bacon wrapped shrimp, chips & guac & salsa, quesadillas, & soft tacos. Also, this used to be the old Diego but it looks like they took down a few walls on the outside to make the space appear more inviting and make it look larger. Diego seemed pretty closed off.\n\nThe reason for the 4-stars is because the service and servers were nothing short of awesome. Very personable, always coming around with food and drink refills. Making great rapport with everyone and cracking jokes, making sure our glasses (literally) were never half empty. Service is a huge factor to me when dining out, and this place just killed it. Felicidades!","Decided to not eat all day. Flew to Vegas and made our 9:30 reservations. The table side guacamole was good. Drinks were ok but very small and very expensive. Entrees were shrimp fahitas, and short rib burritos. Both were ok but nothing you couldn't get at any cheap mexican joints. Wait staff was top drawer.","I LOVE this place!\n\nWe stopped here for dinner one night during a conference we were at the MGM for.\n\nThe food was amazing, service was great, and the guac is to die for!\n\nIt can get pretty busy so reservations are definitely recommended!","This used to be my favorite restaurant in Vegas. However, let me tell you, this was when Hecho En Vegas was called Diego. I went to dinner here with my family and noticed the name change, but assumed the food was the same...WRONG. First off, we had to stand around and wait over 45 minutes to be seated. I know Saturdays must be busy, but the wait was way too long for the quality of the food. When we were finally seated, our order was taken after a while and it took them forever to bring us our food. I mean, another hour or so. By the time they brought us guacamole, we were done with the chips and were starving. The food arrived and it was very small portions for the most part, compared to how it used to be. The enchiladas were my favorite when they were Diego's. That's the reason I came back as well as for the service. Needless to say, the change was for the worst. Everything was different and didn't compare to how it used to be. The service was nothing special and was super slow. I was extremely disappointed in the change. By the end of the night we were all just ready to leave and waited another 30 minutes to get the check so we could leave. We were there for about 3 hours and most of that time was spent waiting. None of us were happy about the change. I will not be returning. Bring Diego's back!!!","food was ok (i don't ask for much when it comes to tex-mex) but service was soo horribly slow that day.","Delicious Mexican food with high quality ingredients. I definitely recommend the table side guacamole and the fajitas (the steak came out cooked perfectly!).\n\nI'll be back!"],"business_id":"Hww3i4P9WsVLsTyXrCG89w","name":"Hecho en Vegas","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Close to 4 stars...\n\nStarted with chips and guacamole which were on point for aure, 5 stars for that and the service.\n\nTacos, carnita and carbon, both hot and made to order. Carnita crispy and moist. Flank steak seasoned well and tender.  Tacos were topped with guacamole and queso fresco, needed a little more with the salsa provided. They give you 3 different kinds, verde, Rojo and habenero. Rice and beans ordered were great, especially the beans. Meal rated 4 stars.\n\nBeverages disappointing,  worst water I have been served in a long time, so I ordered sangria. Sangria offered red and white, I got the red. Had a flavor of artifical coconut that I didn't love. Kinda reminded me of putting spray sunscreen on in the wind, the moment when the wind blows the spray right into your mouth and then you drink sangria to wash it down, yep that's the taste exactly. 2 stars on the drinks....","Independent restaurants like Desnudo Tacos is why I come back to Las Vegas year after year. First off, let me say that from the second we walked into this place we were greeted politely and made to feel welcome. The food was delicious. I would rather hop in the car and drive 5 minutes to eat here than walk to any Mexican restaurant on the Strip. I had the Tinga poblano taco with braised pork shoulder and house-made chorizo as well as a chili infused goat taco. Both were very good. My wife had the torta de puerco which is a sandwich with pork belly carnitas. It was awesome. When I go back I'm getting a couple of those. Get the rice and beans on the side because they're infinitely better than any other Mexican restaurant. I really appreciated that the chef came out toward the middle of our meal and asked how everything tasted. A sign of pride and well deserved. See you guys soon. I hope. Keep it up.","Horchata? None? Grr...\n\nIt is a pet peeve of mine when a place is unable to provide some of their most sought after items - this night, they had no Horchata. It takes hours to make Horchata - and when something takes that long, you obviously should have started making another batch ahead of time, no? That being said -\n\nThe food at Desnudo Tacos is better than average. Flavors are rich - sometimes a little overbearingly, but most people will enjoy their take on Mexican foods. I had the pleasure of trying their Tinga Poblana as well as a Pork Belly Torta. The pork was moist and full of flavor which was a definite plus. The torta was gigantic, and a fantastic value.\n\nThe environment of the restaurant is a bit of a minus for me. The pictures look nicer than the place does in person. It's sparsely decorated and the bright/dark contrasting colors are only on a portion of the walls with the kitchen a bit of an eyesore with its white paint and fluorescent lights.\n\nAdditionally, it's in a bit of a seedy looking area with a terrible parking lot, but that's not totally their fault.\n\nAll in all though, I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again or go there with friends, but I'd hope that they'd be a little better prepared.","The service here is really good. Our server did an excellent job at accommodating my group and was very nice. The decor makes me feel like I am in a Mexican home during day of the dead its red and black and looks very authentic. I tried the goat and pork tacos both meats tasted very bland and lacked flavor. I am a big fan of naked city pizza but I don't think I will be back to Desnudo tacos any time soon.","Not even a week old and already impressing me sooo much!!!!\n\nSo the name is pretty catchy n fun but let me tell you this gentlemen takes REAL Mexican food cooking pretty serious. You can choose to go to your nearest Del taco if you want those fake Mexican crunchy tacos (hey their not bad) but if you want a real taco with fresh ingredients, good flavor and authentic Mexican sazon then you will be in heaven at Desnudo tacos!!! Or should i say in Mexican folklore heaven, in deed they have the nicest small dinning area filled with dia de los muertos art. I say indigenous meets rock n roll kinda feeling!!! Their menu is simple but full of flavor just like your typical taqueria (tortas,tacos,burritos etc) but with a sort of flavor injection to everything they serve!\n\n We will for sure be returning to try their soups, aguas and tortas.. For now we are beyond satisfied with our tacos de tinga, verde rice and cali  burrito.. The flavor of this place is super sabroso and I applaud them for being unique and traditional. I must say probably the best Mexican food in Las Vegas, now go before they end up with lines so long you will hate to stand in them!!","Fantastic new eatery near Naked City Pizza / Moon Doggies. It's a bit like \"gastro pub\" style authentic Mexican. I had the chivo- goat taco as well as the mushroom and al carbon - steak tacos and all 3 were fantastic. The goat was tender, well braised, juicy yet still tasted like goat! The tacos were large, about twice the size of street tacos. Came with rice and beans, which I normally don't eat but these were amazing. The rice in particular was garlic seasoned which was excellent. The owner was very accommodating (it was slow - 3pm on a weekday). We had a free sample of their elote (corn relish) and could have eaten a whole bowl of that as well ;) \n\nThis is not your run of the mill taquiera nor is it gringo tacos - it's a happy place inbewtween and a little sideways.","Walked into the bar first and almost left, too small and smoky of course.\nFortunately Desnudo is next door and smoke free.\n\nSmall menu but a great food and a great deal for the prices.  Had ceviche, flank steak tacos, fish taco, and chicken taco.  Every item was delicious.  Ceviche seasoned perfectly, steak tacos melt in your mouth, not chewy.\n\n2 cons: No salsa and chips when you're seated.  And the two salsas that arrive with food are tasty but no spice.  They may have some tapatio or cholula in the back but I didn't ask.  Next time I will.\n\nGreat service.","Items Selected:\n\nGuacamole - Avocado, Tomato, Lime, Serrano, Onion, Cilantro, Thick Crispy Tortilla\nCeviche - Mango-Lime Scallops, Salsa, Onion, Cilantro, Pineapple\nChivo - Slow Braised Goat, Guajillo Chile, Avocado Leaf, Banana Leaf, Onion, Cilantro, Radish\nCarnita - Pork Shoulder Braised in Lime Juice, Avocado, Lime Queso Fresco (With Beans and Rice)\nTinga Poblana - Pork Shoulder, Chorizo, Chipotle, Tomato, Tomatillo, Roasted Garlic, Avocado, Crema\nHongos - Sauteed Mushrooms, Baby Spinach, Ancho Chile, Roasted Garlic Crema, Lime Queso Fresco\n\nGarnering ample praise since opening its doors, Chris Palmeri and Christian Dolias' \"Desnudo Tacos\" had been on my 'to do' list for weeks and although my first experience was under the less-than-ideal circumstances of already being quite full from prior dining I can say without a doubt that not only are the commendations well deserved, but that tis visit will certainly not be my last.  Small in size and well-culled in offerings as nearly every topping, accoutrement, and protein is made in house it was with two friends that I sat down at a long bench amidst the Día de los Muertos décor and ordering lightly with an eye to sharing the meal began simply enough with creamy citrus-meets-spice guacamole and tender, bright ceviche before moving on to a quartet of tacos, the three which I tasted all a study of what high quality ingredients and innovative pairings can do to elevate 'simple' street food to new heights.  Beginning first with the Tinga Poblana, a 1-2 punch of braised pork and spicy chorizo finding balance in light crema plus ample garlic and progressing onward to unctuous mushrooms whose woodsy umami-funk was lent levity by light spice and citrus it would be difficult to decide which was more impressive and yet having experienced goat in a number of forms including upscale Greek at Johnny Monis' Komi and traditional Mexican stew from Chicago's celebrated \"Birria Zaragoza\" I can say without second thought that the Chivo here is exemplary, the meat easily shredded by fork with a light gaminess on first bite giving way to soft grassy tones quick to meld with acid, sweetness, and just enough onion and cilantro to make flavors pop; more than enough incentive to return for a second look at it and the rest of the menu...plus perhaps some Naked City next door.","If you want authentic, this is pretty damn close! Who would have thought goat could taste so good. It is a laid back atmosphere with very nice people to serve you and help you. I will be back soon and often.","Ate here for the first time on a week night and business was pretty slow at 6:30PM but picked up by the time we left. Desnudo offers daily specials and their ceviche special happened to be a delectible combo of scallops in a mango reduction with red onions, lime and radish. It was worth the trip from Green Valley just for the appetizer. They have a variety of tacos and we tried three different varieties but the Tinga Poblana were my favorite. The tacos benefit from the crema and lime additions as well as the avocado and flavorful meat combination. We are looking forward to next time; we will order the Chivo, Tinga Poblana and Ceviche of the day.","Well done! I enjoyed my lunch here yesterday so much! The carnitas and the goat taco were my favorites! The side of beans is absolutely worth ordering. I couldn't finish them but I was able to take them home for a snack and I am so glad I did. This is a great addition to the selection of ethnic food in the city. Clearly,the quality of the food is the first priority. Thank you for a wonderful experience.","A very unusual Mexican eatery. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Fresh quality ingredients well prepared and served to you quickly. You won't find these menu offerings elsewhere. Not the best part of town. I recommend lunch through sunset.","Made it to Desnudo Tacos today and we were not let down. It has been getting great reviews since it opened and it is well deserved. We ordered the Hongos Tacos, the mushroom are amazing and  some of the spicy sauce turns it into a five star taco.\nThe Chivo Taco...it's  goat meat what can I say, If its on the menu i need to order it.  .  Add a little of their amazing red sauce and you have the best thing you have ever tasted. We also did some guacamole and it was also very well done, not the cheap over mixed stuff you get in other places.  What is nice is that Desnudos keeps its vegetarian items separate from the meat items, that is nice that they take the time to consider there vegetarian customers. We will definitely be back and try all of the other items on the menu. Next on my list is the Chilaquilas!","Yummy Tacos, Great atmosphere! Try the daily seafood seviche and the chivo tacos and save room for dessert!","Mmm...this place is worth the drive. We got the Cali burrito, steak tacos and a side of chips and mango habanero salsa. They have a lot of specials too. Good quality and excellent service. We will be back for more!","So close to a 4 star!\n\nVisited Desnudo Tacos after the review on cheap eats in the Las Vegas Seven Magazine.  Sounded too yummy to pass up!  \n\nGot there on a weekend evening and the place was empty except for a few other couples double dating.  But, these folks, they brought in food from Moondoggy's next door!  For shame!  Just about all their food was from there.  They only came to Desnudo Tacos to buy some Sangria and a few other drinks.  Didn't even try their food!  Even worse these folks had the nerve to leave their leftovers and a large empty pizza box from next door on the table when they left.  Some folks need a lesson in manners, I tell ya'!\n\nThe place is RED, I'll give it that much, but a bit spooky!  Kinda had that voodoo meets pagan ritual vibe going on.  Liked it somewhat but I kept glancing over my shoulder for some unknown reason.  Theme restaurant...check!\n\nMenu was nice and simple.  We started with the guacamole and chips.  These came out in short order.  Fresh avocado, tomatoes, onions, ciliantro, peppers, and lime with fresh tortilla chips?  Very good starter for the meal to come.  Guacamole was bright, lots of flavor, freshly mashed with quality ingredients.  About as good as guacamole can get.\n\nOur orders came out next.  The wifey got the Burrito de Machaca - slow braised beef with bell peppers, onions, eggs, and salsa Mexciana.  A bit on the wet side because of the beef juices, so it made the underside of the burrito soggy.  But no biggie, the burrito was good.  Beef had lots of flavor from the spices, was super tender, not to mention the portion was good.  \n\nI had the famous Cali Burrito - marinated skirt steak, French Fries, quesadilla cheese, crema, and salsa Mexicana.  This burrito was great, nice kick to the tender steak from the chili marinade, good texture from the addition of the fries (probably why it's considered 'Cali', though I was expecting avocado), all tempered by the crema and cheese.  I enjoyed this very much.  Especially with Desnudo Tacos house made hot sauces, the habanero was a killer.\n\nMy only gripe of why not the fourth star?  Damn Mexican Coca-Cola is overpriced!  Hello...markup!  It was like nearly $4 for a bottle of Mexican Coke, and the bottle wasn't even the standard 1 litre!  it was a tiny bottle.  A bit disappointed since indeed the Coke went great to wash down our meal.  Bummer.\n\nWill probably be back eventually to try the tortas, they look super delicious.  In the meantime Desnudo Tacos...lower the price of your Coke!  Gracias.","I don't know why I've waited so long to write this review - guess I was just too busy stuffing my face with the amazing food at Desnudo Tacos.   I've tried all the different types of tacos on the menu  - carnitas, mushroom, carne  and can't decide which I like best. I keep saying I'll order one of their other menu items, but when the waitress walks over I always go with the tacos.  The chips and guacamole are great - although sometimes the guacamole is a little spicy for me (I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy).  Because I\"m a wimp I love that the taco sauces are mostly \"on the side\" so I can have my food the way I like it and my spice loving friends can have it with a kick they love. \nI'm so glad I live close - because  I may just have to have tacos for dinner - or maybe I\"ll get something else on the menu.","Went in for some late afternoon eats with few expectations for we were unfamiliar  but we were pleasantly surprised.  Enjoyed the everything guacamole, chorizo fries, four assorted tacos and some NV beer.  Christian (owner/chef) was super hospitable and gave us many insights into his 'waste not want not' style of cooking, using whole local goat and pig for his prep. Highly recommend and will return.","Ehhh.....Had this place bookmarked for a while and finally tried it after a couple cold ones next door at Moon Doggies. That said, I am not sure what the big deal is....I had the Ensenada Burrito which was a special and basically a Cali Burrito with shrimp in it. The fries were undercooked and soggy, they may have been what made the burrito so underwhelming....All in all it was just OK and I spent $30 for a burrito, chips & salsa, a Dos Equis, and a tip....Not sure I'll give it another try....","So decided to check this place out from all the great reviews and I have to be honest I'm not a fan. Being Mexican I'm always looking for new spots to try so let's start with the guacamole. Great but not the best and the chips were super hard. I had a tacos one carnitas another chicken. The chicken was great but the tortilla they serve the taco in is huge! I was thinking they were more like street tacos.. Carnitas was good but they over cooked the pork. I also didn't like that you paid extra for rice and beans as sides! Hello this should already be included. For the price I would of rather went to tacos el gordo...","Not impressed. So many good reviews too I feel a little guilty but im being totaly honest. Maybe im biased(Ive been cooking for just under two decades and am Mexican American). First of all everything was Bland, everything. The spanish rice, the  \"chivo\", the \"carbon\". I mean its primarily about the food is it not? Basicaly they get a thumbs down. Im a little insulted that they think they can just cook \"Mexican\" food with theyre little twist and half ass it. I dont mean to offend anyone but if you want solid flavor and good traditional Mexican food I would stear clear of this place.","Good news and bad news, mostly good. First the Mussels in red chile broth are truly incredible, good enough to make the reputation of any restaurant. They are a special now but I hope they hang around for awhile. This place has tremendous potential but needs some fine tuning.\n\nThe Guacamole is just OK, it's fluffy, lacks density and real avocado flavor, nicely seasoned though and the chips were great. Could be just the bad avocados available in Winter, we shall see after the Spring thaw. Tacos al Chivo [Goat] were the best meat I have had outside of the Cabrito in Nuevo Laredo; as good as the meat was we were not given any salsas, onions or other items to dress our tacos.\n\nTacos al Carbon were tasty but needed a lot more carbon, next time I will use the two magic words \"bien doradito\" when ordering them. Which brings up our server, who seemed to be somewhat confused and had a difficult time answering what I thought were fairly straightforward questions. Also, they were out of quite a few items and we were not told until we tried to order them. BAD, VERY VERY BAD!\n\nMy GF thought her Tacos de Hongos were unevenly cooked and she was correct but they were still quite good. The rice was rather bland as Mexican rice generally is, however we enjoyed it very much, they were also out of beans-see above. They should keep salt and pepper on the tables as most dishes were very lightly salted. On their Facebook page and most of the photos here all the tacos have double tortillas, we received only single tortillas.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our meal and will return next week, especially if they still have the Mussels*. I understand that they have only been open for a short time and were slammed with more business than they could handle, because of the very early good press they received. If they can iron out the kinks this will be a world class Mexican restaurant.\n\n*We will not make the mistake of sharing an order again.","Only days after opening and Desnudo is already serving up better Mexican eats than others that have been around forever. I love me some carnitas ($6). Ever since an old favorite remodeled, cut back on quality and raised their prices, I've been left to make it at home. The tacos here are great. I prefer them with guacamole to avocado so I ordered the guacamole and chips ($5) to start. This is some damn good guacamole. Tastes like it was made tableside, just without the fuss. It was great to top the carnitas, it makes them really special. The pork has great flavor and the pulled pieces are tender and the fat is crisp. My only nitpick is some pieces were a bit larger so they fell out between bites. My brother joined me for lunch and he tried the California burrito ($6.50). It's a monster. He was unable to finish it, but really enjoyed it. Fortunately, Desnudo is near work, I see it becoming a favorite lunch spot.","awesome tacos, and awesome service! stoked on this place!","This here is some good Mexican food.  It's interesting and surprising; not your average taco shop.  Some examples of the pleasantries experienced here:\n\n- Pozole Rojo...Very tasty and the surprise here is that I'm pretty damn sure there is organ meat up in this soup.  Like maybe some kidneys or liver?  My only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough temperature wise.  However, we did come right after they opened, so maybe it just wasn't heated through yet.\n\n- Cali burrito...ohhh, how I miss these from my San Diego days.  And no one in Vegas seems to get them quite right.  Desnudo is no exception, unfortunately.  A good Cali burrito has French fries in it, not potatoes!  But the carne is deliciously seasoned.\n\n- Hongos Taco...mushroom are my love.  And the mushrooms in this taco were meaty and hearty and tasty.  A little spicy sauce wraps it all up into one hell of a taco.\n\n- Chivo Taco...it's freaking goat meat.  I've never had goat meat, but it ended up being my favorite thing of all.  It tastes very similar to lamb, and boy is it tasty on this taco.  Add a little of their smoky red sauce and you got the winner winner chicken dinner (or should I say goat dinner) here!\n\nMost definitely visiting this place again.  There were many more items on their menu that I wanted to try, but was too full to do so!","Hanging with Christian here at his new restaurant.  Guacamole and south town burrito r to kill for. Homemade sangria is great.atmosphere is casual. Prices are good for the great food.","Great little taco joint.  Tortilla chips and salsa are made fresh.  I had the pork tacos, but look forward to returning for the California Burrito.","Ate here the other day.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't awesome either.  Mediocre at best.  Slightly disappointing based upon the other reviews but I guess we're just spoiled from all of the good taqueria's in Cali.  \n\nWe tried a few different tacos.  Tinga was like soggy pulled pork, Carbon and pollo tacos were okay.  Guacamole was delish but the chips tasted like they were fried in old oil.  I won't be rushing back.","I finally had the pleasure of dining here after hearing such great reviews from friends, Yelp, and local articles, and I have to say that Desnudo Tacos truly lived up to the expectations.  Residing right next to Naked City Pizza, in the same building as Moon Doggies, the restaurant sits in a great location for locals and tourists alike, especially for those who may be visiting the Palms or the Rio.\nA few of the items we ordered we're the guacamole with house made chips, a couple of tacos absolutely stuffed with delicious, flavor-filled pork and chorizo, and for my girlfriend, the Cali burrito.  The drink I was promptly delivered was a house-blended horchata, which I have to say was the best I have tasted, with just the perfect amount of cinnamon and sweetness without over doing it.  I definitely recommend ordering anything you get as a combo, since the hefty sides of Mexican rice and beans were some of the best I have tasted.  Even the habanero-garlic green salsa brought out to accompany the guac was exploding with flavor and just the right amount of spice to make you want to finish the entire thing before the main course arrived, but making you struggle to hold off so you can add some to your tacos, torta, or burrito that you may have ordered.  Although I'm sure the incredibly personable and friendly staff would be more than happy to bring plenty more out to satisfy your sudden craving.  \nEvery dish and side at this comfortable, amped-up taco shop has so much detail and care in te preparation, with everything being made in house and hand-crafted, that you will assuredly want to go back the next day, if not for dinner or a late-night feast, to try something else on their authentic menu.  \nChef Christian Dollas of CutThroat Culinary truly lives of to his local fame and potential, and I can't wait to see what he does next, whether it be one of his pop-up dinners or any of the up-coming new items at DT, switching it up every other day with another house-made salsa or an incredible brunch menu on the weekend.  Needless to say, I will definitely be back soon, with any friends or family who are craving not just tacos, but delicious, affordable cuisine.","The first thing that comes to my mind when writing this review is unmemorable.\n\nAfter walking in, I was skeptical about eating here because it smelled of grease and many of the tables were unclean. \n\nI ordered the guacamole with chips to start and the carne tacos with rice and beans. The guacamole was bland and chips slightly greasy. I was not impressed with the corn tortillas because they were store bought and cold. Carne asada meat was tough and flavor was average. The rice did not taste better than a Mexican rice mix from the store. Beans tasted freshly made and were piping hot. \n\nThe service was also slow because there was one waitress taking orders, bringing out the food, and busing tables. \n\nI don't see any need to go back to Desnudo because the tortillas are not home made and the restaurant felt unclean.","We were going to Naked City Pizza for my son's 18th birthday.  Since they are located in the bar we ate inside Desnudo Tacos and let me tell you when I saw the menu I had to try it.  The Fideo soup was by far the best I have ever had.  I got chicken and cheese tacos and were able to sample the beans, rice and pork.  The service was outstanding.  WE WILL BE BACK!!!","I have enjoyed the Desnudo Taco Nights inside of Moon Doggies before the restaurant opened up next door.  I am so happy I can now have their delicious tacos any night of the week!\n\nWe ordered the California Burrito, Chips and Salsa, Sauteed Vegetables, and a side of beans. \n\nWhile everything we ordered that day was fantastic, the sauteed veggies were INCREDIBLE! Definitely choose the vegetables over the beans.","I've had Desnudo Tacos bookmarked for quite some time now and I seemed to have a pretty similar experience to a few others. It was just on the edge of 4 stars.\n\nThe location itself is a bit sketch. They are on the corner of DI and Arville in between Moon Doggies/Naked City Pizza and a tattoo shop. Even at 7pm on a weeknight, we noticed a few characters wandering around the area. Inside the restaurant is pretty cool though. I'm not a huge fan of the community style bench seating but the décor is neat and my son loved the arcade game. \n\nMuch like other taco spots, the menu is somewhat limited. Desnudo takes it a bit further though and offers different specials throughout the week. To start off, we got an order of the chips and guacamole. The guacamole is really delicious and I'd highly recommend it. Although a little light on the salt for my taste, the flavor was spectacular and had a nice, balanced touch of heat. My only major complaint was with the chips as they weren't salted at all and pretty stale. \n\nFor my meal, I ended up ordering the Tinga Poblana tacos, which feature a combo of pork shoulder and chorizo. The meat itself was extremely tender and flavorful but the ratio of meat to tortilla was way off for me. Their tortillas are decent, but they are big and for me, it was just too much. I do love the fact that they are topped with fresh avocado and a killer crema though. They've also got some of the best beans and rice I've had in a taco joint. \n\nThe food itself was a solid 3.5 stars but the service kept me from bumping this up to a 4. I'm not sure if our waitress was new but she was unfamiliar with the menu and didn't even know what arroz meant. At the end of our meal, I believe the check was wrong too. With just us two and our 5 year old, we spent about $50 after tip. There was a weird add-on to our bill, but she claimed the register was missing a button or something and swore the bill was right. Even if it was, she was kind of rude about it and with the lack of service throughout our meal, it just made things worse.\n\nIf you're in the area, it's definitely worth a try. In fact, I want to go back to try one of their burritos that seem to be so popular, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat her.","Had the flautas and Hongos tacos. Flautas were great. Guacamole and chips were good! We'll be back.","Desnudo - nude, naked, bare\n\nInteresting name, must be a pun on Naked City Pizza which is next door, because their tacos weren't nude at all, but all dressed up. Which is a good thing! Sometimes you want a nude taco, sometimes you don't. \n\nActually, it was only after reading Mike's review that I realized how many ingredients go into each taco. Wowzers. And the taste in the final product shows the love and care put into the ingredients. Desnudo tacos are some great tacos. \n\nMy favorite was the Tinga Poblana (Pork Shoulder, Chorizo, Chipotle, Tomato, Tomatillo, Roasted Garlic, Avocado, Crema ). Tinga poblana is a stew made from pork and chipotle and the result is that the meat comes out tender and flavorful. Desnudo's version does not disappoint. I haven't tried many versions of Tinga Poblana but I don't have to, I think I found one of the best. I highly recommend it,  head and shoulders over the carnitas, which the bf had. The carnitas were good too but the Tinga was special. \n\nMy new BFF (best foodie friend) was more adventurous and went with the Chivo (goat meat). As a child, I hated goat and lamb, and the gamey taste it left in my mouth. But the last few years, I've learned to love lamb, and now, Desnudo has me loving goat meat!  The goat was tender and flavorful, with a slight gamey-goat taste, which was pleasant to the palate and oh, so good to the tummy. I'd get these again. \n\nHonorable mention to the Mango-Lime Ceviche, the scallops were tender perfection. TBH: I didn't see any mangoes, maybe they only use the juice. Hongos tacos were good too, they used a mushroom mixture that had enoki, but I thought it was a bit salty. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a high-styling place. I think I invented a new word: GASTROSTAND. LOL. Desnudo is a gastro-taco-stand. It has the feel of a taco stand but they serve high-end food and drink (which I will imbibe in next time). Loved the art work and bathrooms too. \n\nGreat place! Go check it out!","Very good. Tried the pork belly tacos. Glad I tried something different. They were fantastic. Unfortunately they use onions in everything and I HATE onions. Otherwise it would be 4 stars. The down side is that it's CRAZY expensive. 2 tacos, rice and beans were $13. Small portions and hole in the wall atmosphere should be about half that. Probably won't be back.","Not exactly cheap food, but for the most part you'll get what you pay for.\nPretty awesome 'Surf and Turf' burrito with a ton of shrimp and carne asada with guacamole and a few bonus french fries in the burrito for that trademark SoCal texture. This burrito is so big it can sit up on one end on its own, like a fat cat. Delicious. All the lunch money at $14, but delicious nonetheless!\n\nThe star of the Desnudo salsa show is the homemade habanero salsa, not too hot and refreshingly flavorful, we easily used 1/3 of the bottle on our food. Don't let the orange appearance scare you from trying it - it's really not that hot. The ceviche looked fantastic - the dudes next to us got it - big portion, too.\n\nDiet Coke, one burrito, two tacos = $25 + tip and you're looking at a $30 meal. If it were half that I'd probably want to eat here at least once a week. But it's not, and unfortunately this neighborhood SUCKS (Arville between Sahara and Desert Inn) - I have to admit that part of me was wondering if the wheels on our Jeep would still be there after our meal was done. Kids in this neighborhood have no problem throwing landscaping rocks at moving cars (yes, this has happened to us) and their parents will defend them. You've been warned!\n\nDesnudo's front doors were propped wide open, and as a result there were more than a few house flies divebombing our food plates. Swatting at flies during your restaurant meal is not that awesome. Maybe if the rock-throwing kids wouldn't litter on Arville so much there wouldn't be such swarms of flies?\n\nI digress. Desnudo is definitely worth a try. You may fall in love with some of the recipes here. The environs will make you feel like you're off the beaten path.","Desnudo tacos ( tacos naked ) is not your ordinary taco shop, they don't rely solely on grease for flavorful tacos, they actually use some kind of Aztec or Mayan magic to create some of the best tasting tacos I've had this side of the I-15 in Vegas.\nWith my tacos I ordered some sides, the fideo soup which it was really good, alittle bit on the salty side but good nonetheless. The garlic rice was...we'll too garlicky for me, the beans where so good I could just eat a bowl of them by itself. The meat in the tacos was juicy and tender and topped with real Mexican cheese, I added some real good homemade Mexican salsa which they have in many heat levels nicely supplied in a bottles instead of the common little salsa bowls.\n This is also not your basic traditional taco shop either, it is actually a sit down restaurant where they bring you a menu and go through all that blah blah restaurant stuff and although the service is more than awesome the reason I usually go to taco places is for quick fast food style service but if they are going to take the full service route then they should at least serve complimentary chips and salsa. so next time I stop here I'll make sure I have more than enough time to enjoy the nicely decorated room, dia de lo muertos style, and listen to the not so Mexican alternative rock style music. \n No shirt, no shoes no service..... But go desnudo.","Rolled in here at 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon after reading some Yelp reviews.  Thanks, Stefany V!\n\nI had my heart set on the Pig Sandwich (Torta de Puerco).  I was not disappointed.  I'd describe the sandwich, but there's no way I could do better than Stefany V's writeup.  Just read her review instead!  :)  It was the best food I've thrown down the old gullet in quite some time.  Pickles on a pork sandwich?  Sign me up!\n\nWhy four stars?  It's kind of a hole in the wall; I might just get food to go next time.  Limited seating including a couple of picnic tables.  And I had a dancing chair - one leg was about three inches shorter than the others and I nearly biffed it a couple of times.  Shouldn't have been drinking, I guess.\n\nThe service was very good and the other food I saw looked great.\n\nGive it a shot!","I stopped by Desnudo while home visiting and am almost sorry I did. Because now all I can do is wish for those tacos to be somehow teleported to me across state lines. Why can't modern technology keep up with my needs?\n\nThis is the most unpretentious restaurant you'll probably eat at in Vegas-it is a literal hole in the wall with pretty limited seating, fun decor and one TV for those socially awkward folks who like to watch a screen while dining with others. You don't to do that here; you're gonna want to focus on the food. Note: the parking lot is a small hot mess of a situation, so if you're coming during high traffic times, be prepared to be almost backed into or almost hit by someone coming around a blind corner several times as you enter and exit.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive and it can afford to be. Tacos are their specialty (obviously) but they also have tortas, burritos, chips+salsa, etc. Again, limited menu but you won't need to look far to find something good. I got the chivo (goat) and hongo (mushroom) tacos as a combo that came with rice and beans. I judge any place that serves Mexican food by the beans and if the beans are bad well then they might as well close up shop. Desnudo got the beans right. And the rice too. I probably shouldn't have eaten as much of the beans and rice as I did, but I couldn't stop! The tacos were fantastic-hard to say that one was better than the other since one was meat and the other basically vegetarian, so I loved both equally. I was skeptical about that mushroom taco (as I am with any vegetarian anything)-mushrooms are often used as a lame vegetarian substitute for meat dishes and it's often terrible. Desnudo did a great job of just letting the mushrooms be mushrooms and really capitalizing on their flavor. Didn't miss the meat with these! The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR! The fresh bright toppings offset the richness of the meat just making for a well balanced bite every time. I guess my only ding is that the meat could have been shredded better-there were some larger pieces in there that made eating kind of unattractive but honestly it was so good I almost didn't care. \n\nThe service was really great-our waiter was friendly and attentive and I never felt rushed (the place was starting to fill up as we left). I have such an extensive list of places to visit whenever I'm home visiting and Desnudo's been added to that list!","Way to go Desnudo Tacos! Excellent food, atmosphere and the owner is friendly and passionate about his menu.","The service was friendly, the prices were right and my tinga poblana taco was fantastic.  There were plenty of other menu items I would like to try, so this place is staying on list of go to lunch spots.","Kellee K's ROTD mentioned the California burrito two months ago, which first put this place on my radar. Then LV Weekly mentioned their torta de Puerco in last week's edition. And I couldn't put it off any longer, so I came in today.\n\nOrdered both of the above, takeout, split at home with the BF. He grew up with Cali-style Fresh-Mex, I grew up with border-style Tex-Mex. Despite our different mexican food preferences, we both thoroughly loved the drastically different dishes we tried.\n\nThe Cali burrito was huge, packed with carne asada, fries, different salsas, cheese, and other yummy things- the flavor profile was complex, spicy, meaty, and amazing. Somehow, despite being an especially americanized burrito, the authentic ingredients gave it a genuine, traditional flavor. I'd eat this any day of the week, and it was spicy enough not to need any of the extra red or green salsa.\n\nThe LVW article doesn't play around, putting the torta on it's list of top 10 Mexican meals in the city- describing the sandwich as \"loaded with pork belly carnitas, lime-braised pork shoulder,  quesadilla cheese, pickled vegetables and lettuce.\" Ingredients I never would have expected in a torta, nor thought to combine, all singing together in perfect, crunchy, harmony: crispy, buttery roll plus crispy, greasy pork, plus bright, acidic pickled veggies balanced by fresh lettuce and a touch of creamy cheese. Pretty sure my  BF would sell me on a streetcorner for a truckload of these. Or maybe even just one.\n\nI'll definitely be back. Service here was stellar- takeout order ready in 10 minutes, packed with napkins, forks, extra salsa, and a smile. \n\nBe sure to turn early and park in the lot by the bar, you'll have to walk around to get to this place- but let's face it, if you're eating Mexican food, you probably need the workout.","Was tricky to find but well worth the hunt!!! Great tacos, and friendly chef! We will definitely be back for more!!!","Okay so where do I start. I kept debating about two or three stars for this place as I border on \"meh\" and \"A-ok\" Very cool vibe in the place, sort of hip dive bar.Music was a little loud but it was music I like at least.  I think thought the food is overpriced, I paid about $10.00 for a machaca burrito, enchilada style with no sides.  The flavor was good but it was really salty and this coming from a person that loves salt.  Also, we had the habanero salsa and chips - also good but had to pay for it, I think around $4, whereas most mexican places chips and salsa are complimentary.  I liked the mild salsa, had a good smoked chipotle flavor to it - that might have been my favorite part of eating there. Also, had the pork belly beans, again good flavor but the pork belly was indistinguishable and pieces were so small they could easily put in salt pork and it would look and taste about the same. On the up side they sold Joseph James beer, so kudos for supporting a local brewery although I am not a huge fan of Joseph James in general but they are local. Ended up being $25.00 for lunch for two people with one ice tea. I noticed we were the only people in there eating food from Desnudo, the other two groups had pizza from Moon Doggies next door. A employee of Desnudo kept walking back to Moon Doggies and picking up the pizza to bring over for the other patrons, good service I guess in that respect and it made me wonder if they are owned by the same people. Either way, for the money I think I will try elsewhere next time. On a seperate note the plates for the burrito and the chips were both chipped in multiple places (no pun intended) - no big deal to me for a divey place but I am sure the health district might ding them on it."],"business_id":"I_h0uin_oo0WNqFy3qKEpw","name":"Desnudo Tacos","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I love their salads! I prefer the barbacoa and carnitas over the steak and chicken. I'm very picky with my meat, so it's nice that I don't generally have to worry about finding a fatty piece in my salad. The food is always fresh and the service is generally very good. This is a great place to go during an hour lunch since they are very efficient.","To be frank, I love Chipotle.  I can probably eat it every day....  shh.... don't tell my wife.\n\nSo when it comes to the food, it's the same no matter where you go.  I will say that it's a little less spicy than some.  But it's interesting.  Now as far as location, this place has absolutely sucky parking but you can see it from Eastern like a lighthouse in the rough seas.   I love the look from the outside, and the outdoor seating.\n\nThe inside is also pretty small, non-typical setup and the line area is completely different from most Chipotle's.  Most of the time, the seating is right up against the ordering area, whereas this one is off to the side.  The line area is pretty short too so I'm guessing they either 1) get customers through quickly or 2) don't get many customers.\n\nI'm going to go with the former since there's always people there it seems.   Nothing you can do about the parking, and the people who prepare the food and take your money seem pretty cheerful which is always a good sign.  Believe me.... nothing like a disgruntled food prep worker that will make you wonder what went into your burrito.\n\nAll in all, it's a good chain but they get a push in their ratings for picking a good outward facing location that really shines while driving towards Anthem.","Fast cheap Mexican food. Very addicting. Love the chicken bowl from there. Pretty decent healthy option as well, as long as you don't add the sour cream and cheese. Only problem I have with Chipotle is that the amount of food you get each time is different, depending on the server.","As far as Chipotle overall goes, 2 of these stars go simply towards that.  Taste of food +1, service overall -1 (yes, it's that bad).  If this wasn't the closest one to my house I would definitely stop going.\n\nThey have screwed up my order more times than gotten it right -- and this is from ordering online, where they have a physical piece of paper directing them what to put into it.  Several times I've ordered online and come to the restaurant at the pick-up time given on the site and come to find out they haven't even MADE my order yet.  Not terrible since it's fresh but why bother putting a pick-up time?  They weren't even busy either.\n\nI think this location just has a lot of lazy employees.  Food quality is still good in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants, but perhaps speaking slowly and clearly would be ideal when placing an order.\n\nIf ordering online, it's a mixed bag.  Sorry.","I use to go here ALL the time. It was one of my favorites. Went here last week and WOW has the place changed. 2 bowls NO chips or drink and my total was $17.50 ??? That's insane. The price could have been justified if my bowl had been completley full, but it wasn't. Maybe it was due to the 17 years old running the hot well, but honestly for the price and amount of food I was given I will not be returning any time soon. Such a disappointment because like I said this use to be one my favorite places.  oh well.","DISCLAIMER: This review is based on one and only one trip to Chipotle\n\nFor literally years, I have heard great things about Chipotle. There never seems to be a Chipotle location close to my work or home though. Recently I had a lunch time appointment just  up the street from this Chipotle so I decided to give them a try.\n\nChipotle shares a parking lot with numerous other businesses, and the parking lot set up leaves a lot to be desired. I managed to snag the only open spot in front of the store, but can see how the parking situation here could be really aggravating. \n\nWalking in, I was greeted by what seemed like every employee working and half of the line of customers. The noise level was ridiculous, being a Chipotle virgin I had to respond with 'What?' to every question the employees asked about how I wanted my meal. It got annoying really quickly.\n\nI got my meal and a coworkers meal to go. Total damage for two burrito bowls, nothing else, was over $15! My food was good, but overall I am left rather unimpressed by Chipotle. The menu seemed limited, the prices seemed to be on the high side and the ambiance of this particular location was lacking.... I wouldn't rush back.","Really nice service, great food, but pretty comparable to every other Chipotle you go to. I'm pretty sure uniformity is their middle name. \n\nI do love how really great their food is and it's so filling. The guacamole and lime chips are heavenly! I love everything they offer, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it seems a little pricey. \n\nWhen I go in I usually don't get rice, I get lettuce, which would seem to be cheaper, but I always pay the same price no matter what. I always get the steak which, had I not gone vegetarian, I would eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. YUM. \n\nThe location is super clean, lots of seating and the staff is super friendly and really engages you. They're also really young so that tells me that Chipotle must train their staff pretty thoroughly. Whatever they're doing, it works for me!\n\nLove this place!","I love Chipotle. From MN, MO, KS, NE, CO, and NV I've had a lot of Chipotle. My waistline says too much of it to be honest. But while I love Chipotle, this location sucks. The parking lot...is super tight to get in and out of. The outside seating area faces Eastern Ave so you can inhale a big burrito with sides of car exhaust and tire particulates floating through the air if that's your thing. Step inside and enjoy the confusing, overly funky layout to stand in line. And once you get ready to order, it all goes wrong. \n\nIn the quest for speed the guy making my burrito was a slob. I knew I was in for a bad Chipotle experience when I looked at the second tortilla press which was buried under a pile of napkins and other crap. If they can't keep their front line clean...it's not a good sign. \n\nMoving on the guy who was making my food reminded me of the tweakers I used to see in Southern Missouri. This twitchy guy forgot to put meat on my burrito. Then he ended up spilling salsa on the counter and he barely got some on my burrito. Then after telling him \"and guacamole too even though it costs extra, please\" I get asked again if I want guacamole. And then when Mr. Tweaker guy goes to wrapping up my burrito he makes it explode! See all those states I listed at the start of this review? I've had a lot of great Chipotle employees make a lot of silver foil wrapped mega burritos of indulgence for me. I know my typical order can be made without my burrito exploding onto the floor. Yet all the foil in the world couldn't save my burrito...the pieces of it are likely resting at the Apex landfill as I write this. And now faced with the embarassment of having to scoop my 1st burrito into the trash Mr. Tweaker dude decides to whip up Burrito #2. At this point I'm like **** this, and I just let him do his thing, pay for my stuff and get the heck out of there. But I always get chips and guac and salsa too...and so guess who gets to fill that order? Yep, Mr. Tweaker dude. And he's in so much of a hurry that plastic cups end up crash landing into the salsa...and I'm just thankful to walk out of there with cups containing anything. So after getting to my car I get to try and squeeze out of the parking space, and I finally get the heck out of there. And when I get home and open up Burrito #2? It tastes like.....well this is a relatively family friendly review site so I'll spare the profanity. \n\n1 Star. Because this location seriously sucks. And by the way the kids meal chicken taco was so bad, my 3 year old spit it out and refused to eat it. \n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #16)","I love chipotle, especially for us Gluten Free and Vegan Folks. Their bowls are amazing,  although I avoid eating corn, their corn tortillas are delightful. I usually just get a bowl with Brown Rice, lettuce, black beans, and guacamole... So yum! I like that they try and provide their customers with organic and or all natural produce at all times possible. That alone shows me they care about their customers.  The staff at this location have always been very friendly. The food is great, the staff is wonderful but the down side is the parking lot. Very small and tight. It usually isn't too big of a hassle to handle, but sometimes I've had to wait a few minutes to be able to park. In the mood for some simple, but very tasty food? Chipotle is the answer.","I always enjoy Chipotle but had an odd experience at this one. My wife ordered a bowl with beef and the girl put chicken. When I told her we wanted beef she said \"I thought you said chicken\" , then in stead of making a new one with beef she starts trying to scoop the chicken out of the bowl with her spoon. I gave her a puzzled look for a moment and when I started to ask what she was doing and my wife realizing that this women couldn't buy a clue just said \"that's fine, I'll just take the chicken\" just to avoid making a federal case out of it.  Of course the girl never bothered to apologize for the mistake. Very strange...","With many Chipotle locations throughout Las Vegas, don't choose this one. The customer service is lacking at this location and their portion control rates about a D- in my book. I've been to this location a handful of times and every visit seems to get worse. If I were to compare the amount of food I get at this location with any of the other 3 I have been to in Las Vegas, it would be roughly 35-40% less. \n\nWhen restaurants run low on product and are waiting for a fresh batch from the kitchen, you should be asking your customers if they would mind waiting a few extra minutes. At this location however, when they run low on chicken, steak etc., they take what should be a portion for one person and divide it between two. Even when there's plenty of meat available, the portions are small but during a rush it's almost embarrassing. Either the employees are not trained on how to handle these types of situations or the owner is more concerned about their bottom line instead of customer service. I will not be returning to this location and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","Chipotle is always good, the parking is not that great at this location. The customer service can use some work but still great food and its fast.","Up front let me say I have probably been to this Chipotle's at least 25 times as it is on my way home from work. I have also eaten at Chipotle's all over California, Colorado and Nevada so I do have other experiences with this chain. \n \nThis Chipotle is a difficult one to review. The parking lot is not big enough for all the chain restaurants there, (Golden Spoon, Five Guys, Buffalo Wild Wings and Chipotle), as well as other business's. Lately there is also a pretty aggressive man standing outside hitting EVERYBODY up who walks by for money. He always says, \"Would you like to donate something for the veterans today\" ? So, if you say No Thanks, you sound like you don't support our boys and girls in uniform. The guy has no badge on so you have no idea what he represents besides \"The Veterans\". He also has many bouquets of flowers that he uses to get you to contribute even more money since you are getting something in return. And HE WILL hit you up again as you leave with your take out food 10 minutes later. Now, if the guy is legitimate you would think he would soften his approach and wear some kind of permit that allows him to solicit money from me every time I walk by him. He is NOT a mellow guy either. I can see his \"style\" being a bit intimidating for the softer people in the world. But I digress from the Chipotle. \n  \nSo, You finally get inside and the line is usually long. The employee's routinely disappear into the back leaving confused customers waiting for, well, you are not sure what you are waiting for as most of the time the employee has gone off to do something unrelated to you. You, who was standing in front of them trying to pay your money or tell them you wanted sour cream, and they vanish. Just weird. The food I found to be pretty good all the time. I agree with other reviewers on here that say your portion sizes are small. It seems to vary with the employee as I have gotten just HUGE burrito's that I can't finish and smaller ones that leave me wanting more chips or something else. I always get the same thing so it is interesting to see how it will turn out this trip. But, like I said, the food is GOOD.\n  \nSo, bottom line is I can only give 3 stars since the food is always good, BUT the portion sizes do vary, the employees are kinda weird with how they wait on everybody, and the solicitor outside needs to have someone tell him to wear the permit he should have that gives him permission to bother everybody as you walk both in and out of this place.","Use the \"Chipotle Tabasco\" The bad rating is for the Service I recieved:(","Chipotle is hit or miss. At times they give you a ton of meat and the burrito can be a mixture of deliciousness. Other times i feel like they pour on the rice and sprinkle the meat. My go-to move is always the carnitas burrito. Overall you can't go wrong if you're craving an americanized version of fast mexican food. I also hate it how they get mad when you ask them to mix up the fillings, as if it's that big of a deal.","To long of a wait, employees complaining \"where did everyone go?\"  No chips, no Guaq (would have been another 10+ mins wait) after already waiting 20+ mins get food.  Employee on cell phone scrambling to make Guaq.  \n\nPoor management.","No more lettuce for my salad?  Well take your lazy butt to the back and chop up some more vegetables . What a bad customer experience. I will never go to the Chipotle ever again lazy late night crew","I like chipotle, but this location is not the good at service. It takes them really long time to serve food and lot of time its cold and not fresh. Service could improve bit better since, they have given me wrong item many times. I only go there because its the closest location to my house. Overall (2/5)","I hate that this is the closest location to my house. I love Chipotle, since it's easy to cobble together a pretty healthy meal. First, the parking situation leaves a lot (of spaces) to be desired. Second, this location seems to always be overstaffed, but very inefficient. The last couple of times I've gone, there's been an employee in between the food assemblers and the cashier whose only functions seem to be greeting people who walk in the door and making sure all the paper bags are folded before handing them to the customer. She creates an unnecessary delay between ordering food and said food making its way to my belly. Third, they seem to always be out of something. Last time, it was chicken. How they didn't have another batch of chicken ready to go, I have no idea. The way they dealt with the problem was inefficient, as per usual.\n\nI think I'm about ready to drive the same distance in the other direction to Qdoba.","This location is horrible. The lady behind the counting was shouting and the portions she served were ridiculously small.","The first thing I has to say about this place is that it is NOT Mexican. They need to change the name of this place or something because this is not Mexican at ALL. \nI rally hate this place and about every single person in my Mexican family hated it. \nEvery single one of them agree that it is not Mexican at all. \nTaco Bell would be more Mexican than this. I'm embarrassed of this place. \nI've eaten here 3 times and I hated everything. My parents hate it too and we couldn't even finish our meal. \nI have no idea how anyone could eat here. \nI eat almost anywhere and I hate making bad reviews but this place is just that bad.\nIf people like it then that's fine and all but I can't stand that it's called Mexican.","I agree with other comments that this Chipotle is situated in horribly designed and under-sized parking lot. My advice is to park in the Citibank parking lot across the way and walk over if the lot looks busy. In the long run it is quicker to do that and walk than sit in your car and wait for the constant shuffling of cars occurring in front of the store\n\nThe food is pretty good, when they have enough of it prepared. Often times I go in there and they are out of either chicken, steak, or both and as a result there is a long line of people standing there waiting all staring at their phones. All of this is while some worker back by the grill is frantically grilling or cutting up steak or chicken. I get nervous that the usually young person cutting is going to hack a finger off at the speed they are going. \n\nOne time I went in there and both doors were propped open and the place smelled of smoke and the person at the counter said they only had the barbacoa because their \"grill was broken.\" It certainly smelled like it was working to me, albeit a little too well. I tried the barbacoa  and it was way to spicy for my taste. \n\nThe steak can be hit or miss with it being either a perfect medium or tough and well done. The safe bet is usually the chicken.","Love me some Chipotle!\n\nFreshly cooked, properly seasoned, (usually) quickly served.  As fast food goes this is one of the best chains.","Be sure you know what you want before you enter the que. People will complain lol","Love this place however I just bought dinner and a show. Just a word of advice, if you have an issue with another coworker, don't deal with it in front of the entire restaurant. Went in on June 2 at around 830 and witnessed this situation of distasteful tact. Love the food and the service towards the customers but wow.","I got a burrito here this evening and found a HAIR like an eyebrow size in it as well as a small nat like bug inside the tin foil.  I eat chipotle all the time and have NEVER found something like this in my food.  I highly suggest this location to be looked at by the health department.\n\nI would go to any other location than this one.  Absolutely disgusted!","I seriously can eat this everyday....  Only thing I ever eat here is the salad.  You can tell the meat her is different.  I believe they advertise that the meat was raise without antibiotic and cage free.  That really mean alot to me hahahah.. Honestly now days very often you go out and eat and the meat are like plastics and so fake..  \n\nFood is very fresh and very refreshing after you ate it.","I like Chipotle. The service at this store is spotty though. It's right down the street from my bfs house, so we go here often. I always get a steak burrito bowl or salad, as well as a bag of the lime tortilla chips. Then, I ask for extra salsa and sour cream, but on the side. They don't charge for extra sides of toppings. So now I have like 4 things to dip my chips into and they were all free! It's funny because they have chips and salsa on the menu for like $1.65 and in reality you can just do what I do and pay for only chips which are like 95 cents. Winning!","I'm originally from NE Ohio and I'd never seen a Chipotle that didn't have a line of people going out the door. But this one on S. Eastern is often empty when I go there. That made me nervous, but maybe it's because there are so many Mexican and Mexican-style restaurants in the area already.  The food here is just as good as any other Chipotle, and the place looks clean.  The staff are friendly and service is pretty quick.  I've never eaten there- I always get takeout. Parking is a problem because there are other restaurants in the area, so unless you like waiting for a place to park or don't mind having to walk a bit, I'd suggest going during the times that most people aren't headed out to restaurants.","The place is clean.  Prices are always decent.  The burritos, tacos, and salad are big.  It's just that the food here gets a bit tiring for me.  I know of people who really love this place though, and don't seem to get tired of it.  It's just that there isn't much of a variety to choose from.  You've got your salads, tacos, or burritos all of which that consist of the same stuff.","I love me some burritos, however my major gripe about Chipotle is the god damn cilantro they put in just about EVERYTHING. \n\nCilantro is nasty. It smells like unwashed ass, and tastes like metallic liquid hand soap. If they didn't put this crap in 3 out of their 4 salsas, and even in their rice(!) they'd easily get 5 stars... I'm tired of getting strange looks from the staff when I refuse to eat the rice they have loaded with this foul weed (yes, cilantro is a WEED, not an herb... get it right), when they have to go get the regular rice they hide near the stove that doesn't have it in....\n\nOtherwise it's clean and the staff is mostly friendly. Their outdoor patio needs to be wiped down a bit more often though, especially with the nice weather lately.","This is your standard Chipotle. If you like Chipotle, you will like this one. If you don't like Chipotle, don't come here. They are all the same, this one is no different.\n\nThis one is never packed and has a large seating area.","The ONLY reason this location gets 2 stars is because I love Chipotle.  \n\nThe ONLY reason I come to this location is because it's the closest one to my house.\n\nTypical Chipotle assembly line of workers and food.  The service is horrible and they don't put much food in the bowls. I don't know how many times tonight I had to say \"Corn, Sour Cream, Cheese, Guac and lettuce\" Needless to say, after the worker put the to go lid on my bowl, I had to then tell her AGAIN she didn't put the cheese on.  Every single time I come to this location, I have to say at least twice \"extra this, extra that\" because they always put less than a spoonful in the bowl. Who knows, maybe at the other Chipotle's I've been to they're just generous. \n\nI understand that it's fast food, and I understand they need to get people in and out as quickly as possible, however I don't see a need for that considering every time I'm there, it's EMPTY.","I only came here once and refuse to go back. Upon first entering the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that Blue Moon wasn't an available beer option. Since being to other Chipotle restaurants in Vegas I'm guessing it's a Vegas thing, as they used to have Blue Moon at my usual Chipotle in CA. I opted for a different beer and ordered a steak burrito. The steak was so chewy and full of fat it was difficult to eat, let alone enjoy. My friends ordered shredded beef, which they said was good. It's possible that I showed up on an off-day or something but it was enough to turn me off from this location.","If you like this style restaurant and burrito then you will love this location.\n\nPros: Clean, high end area\n         Great outdoor patio with nice view of Eastern to look at people\n         Next door to Golden Spoon for dessert afterwards\n\nCons: Busy like every Chipotle\n          Not healthy for you no matter how they spin it\n          They need more than one size burrito","after having chipotle for many many times, then trying zabas. i must sayyy chipotle is for beginners! who would have ever thought that sour cream and cheese would taste amazing with rice and beans? well what i do love more at chipotle than zabas are their chips and guac! the chips have a hint of lime that when ordering, i sometimes only get the chips and splash some mild tabasco on them. mmmmm!","What can I say about Chipotle?  Chipotle is kind of weird, it's like if In-N-Out burger sold burritos.  It's one of those places that isn't everywhere.  If you have one then you'll find yourself there every once and awhile.  I really like Chipotle even though I only get one thing there.  Yes, ONE item off the menu!  I get steak tacos, soft, a little bit of pinto beans, mild salsa, hot salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce \"animal style.\" LOL, jk.  Yeah, that's what I get all the time ever!  I know you are probably thinking that Ernesto is so cool, I should try and order that too. Go ahead and try it and you can thank me later.  To sum it up even if there is a line they move pretty fast and there is always meats available.  So check it out and enjoy! Cheers!","Worst Chipotle in town... Slow service... 4 workers can't handle 10 people in 30 mins... And cashier asked what my order was three times!  Food was OK... there portions are smaller or the people don't know how to make can burrito","Other than this Chipotle, I usually go to the Maryland Pkwy location in front of UNLV. I give this place 3 stars because of the service and the amount of food they give you lol. Chipotle is such a great place that has the fast food vibe, but gives a new spin on a fresh, fast food establishment. By all means I am not a piggy and don't expect large portion meals when I go out, but every time I have gone to this place, they give you half a spoonful of meat and you are digging through your burrito or burrito bowl to only find a lousy few cubes of steak T__T For a growing and popular fast food chain which is owned by McDonalds, the employees there should ration the toppings out better : )","Last weekend, Lil Man And I came here with a friend and her son. This was our first time. The line was long to get to the counter so that we could order our food, but when we got up to it, we had the chance to order whatever we wanted. My son asked for a salad and said to add whatever I felt like adding to it. So I asked the workers to add the pinto beans, corn, Pico de Gallo salsa, chicken, and bunch of other ingredients. He LOVED it. He was shocked that there were beans in it, but loved it. I had a chicken bowl. I had them make it the same way as my son's salad, but I had them add guacamole on top it it. My friend had a chicken burrito with everything in it. For her son, she ordered him a couple of quesadillas. We had a nice time eating and chatting. The environment was great busy but pleasant.","This is the Chipotle closest to my house. Sometimes they are amazing and other times they are just average. Customer service is always good, its the food that is a little inconsistent by Chipotle's standard. Sometimes there is no salt on the chips and others days they refuse to put any meat in the tacos... but when they get it right its all good.","First of all I love Chipotle. Eat there several times a week. This location however disappoints me. They are slow and rushed to make every order.\n\nToday takes the cake. I should have paid attention to how they put my bowl in the bag because sideways equals a soaked bag  and car seat when I finally got home. The Las Vegas Boulevard location is way better.","Always disappointed here! I must have horrible timing because when I get there they are always out of what I eat! No chicken, or fajita veggies or chips! All of which seem to be staples, but are never well stocked. \nEach time I have to wait 15 or 20 min, they comp me chips or salsa for the wait. That and the proximity to my house keeps me coming back... But I always pause before getting in the car when I get a tex/mex craving because I know it won't go smoothly! \n\nStaff is ok, so t does have its high points, but being a little more proactive with the continuous prep of core items would help immensely!"],"business_id":"JSURpnFu8jy4etZ_My4Erw","name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["My second time at Macayo's, menu seems to be hit-or-miss. I ordered the lunch special chicken taco, chicken enchelada, and beans. Enchelada was fine, but the taco was deep fried with too much cheese. Last visit was better, but can't remember the entree.","First of all, I would like to acknowledge that this review has nothing to do with the staff. Our waitress was very pleasant, friendly, and attentive, as was every other staff member with whom we interacted. The positives ended there, though. The salsa is probably the most bland salsa I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant. I asked for spicier salsa, and it wasn't any better-- and definitely was NOT spicy. Onto our meals. Very overpriced, to begin with. $11 to choose 2 items off of an a la carte menu? Seriously? My husband thought his meal was just okay (chicken enchilada and chile relleno), but the enchilada sauce was horribly bland. I ordered the vegetable fajitas. They brought out the standard fajita plate (guac, sour cream, tomatos, lettuce, beans, tortillas), but the vegetable fajita dish was steamed broccoli, squash, and zuccinni with absolutely no seasonings. I've NEVER had a Mexican restaurant serve me plain steamed broccoli for fajitas! I asked about the traditional fajita vegetables (the grilled, seasoned peppers and onions) and was told that I would have to pay extra for a side of them. Wait... I ordered veggie fajitas but actual fajita veggies cost extra?? By the end of the meal, we had paid almost $30 when we could have had a better \"Mexican\" meal at Taco Bell for $7. I won't be going back to Macayo's... even if someone else is picking up the tab.","I have decided that I hate this place. It was almost a hard decision because their baja sauce is awesome, but there are so many things to hate that I have to be the \"Paul Revere of Yelp\" and warn all of you good people.\n\nThey are sneaky little weasels and want to take your money. I ordered a baja burro and the server asked \"with guacamole and sour cream\"? While she was nodding her head. So I said yes. The bill came and I was being charged an extra $4.00 for sour cream and guacamole that I didn't even use. I know what you are thinking, \"that's your fault, she probably asked if you wanted to add it,\" but that is not the case. Same thing happened at dessert, we ordered the deep fried ice cream and we were asked if we wanted chocolate or regular, so we picked chocolate (the menu doesn't say anything about chocolate costing more money), but sure enough... A teaspoon of Hersheys is another $2.50. Fast forward a week later, the same thing happens to my coworker at the downtown location, they pay an additional $4.00 for sour cream and guac that they didn't even use. I am under the impression that the servers are actually trained to ask you in a way that implies that it is included to jack up your bill.\n\nLook, their food is okay, but the prices are absurd. You can find much better Mexican food at half the price all throughout the Valley. Hell, you can go to Outback and have a steak, salad, bread, blah blah blah for less money. \n\nThe decor is old and tacky, the last server we had hit on my wife while I was in the restroom... Seriously, he said \"He left you? if I was your man I would never do that to you, I would treat you like a queen.\" Yeah, okay Macayos guy with your extra $4.00 that you stole, go on with your bad self.","This is my husband & I's favorite Mexican food in town. It's vegetarian friendly. I order the Cheese enchilada w/onions most of the time or Bean and Cheese Burro (burrito) with or without sauce and have never been disappointed. We always choose to eat in the bar, there is never a wait there and service is fantastic.","Bleach. The salsa tastes like they opened a can of stewed tomatoes and threw in a pinch of parsley. The food was greasy (not fried) and left my stomach unhappy.  My plate looked like they just slopped the food on it.  The hostess was friendly and attentive unfortunately the waitress was one of the worst I have encountered. If you want good Americanized Mexican food, go to On The Border.","A friend took me here when I was in Phoenix and my first impression was of a Mexican TGI Fridays. It wasn't a bad thing. and since I'm a truck driver ANYTHING but the truckstop fast food would have been good. \n\nWe arrive just as they seat a party of eight, and with no hesitation were greeted by a friendly hostess and taken to a table. The table arrangement was a little cramped for me (but then again I'm just under 6' and a couple tortillas shy of 280) and my buddy is in the same range. After a while it felt cozy enough. \n\nOur waiter, I want to say his name is Ernesto, was quick to present himself and ask if we wanted drinks. Now, I'm a trickdriver and like to play the part, I made  a comment about my Corona with no fruit and take it like a man-straight and he responded with something to the fact that he hasn't quite made it there yet and needed a few more years to season himself to man status. Ok, this guy's got personality I thought. My buddy and I are a bit rambunctious and Ernesto didn't shy away from it. He joined in on our fun. His service was spot-on in my opinion to the point that I mentioned it to my buddy. Ernesto was very attentive to our needs. The beer was half-empty \"another beer?\" or \"more chips?\". He even brought all three levels of salsa. \n\nNow on to our food. The menu was simple and efficient, only 4 pages if I remember correctly, and I decided on the chimichangas de Macayo (carnitas). I'm such a sucker for carnitas, I freely admit, but these were top notch. I would go so far as to say better than grandmas back in California. The molé was good, not overpowering, and a great sauce for this plate. The beans and rice were simple and complimenting as they should be. Oh, and the actual chimichanga itself was huge, pushing upwards of 20oz maybe more and my fork was sufficient enough to cut through; no knife needed. The food was also hot all the way through and not just the outer layer. \n\nThe cost was a bit pricey as our bill was $37 and change for two dinners and two beers, but I would say worth the price. The service and food made the 25% tip an easy choice. I'd be happy to goback","Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about...","2 words...baja sauce!\n Also, Mary the bartender is awesome. She always remembers my order.\nI come here often with m boyfriend and we love it! \nGreat happy hour prices too.","We went in a few weeks ago with friends from out of state because we really love the food. It was a super busy Friday evening. We sat in the bar and our server was taking care of a lot of tables so we were ok waiting a little longer than normal to order our first drinks. The issues came in when we had to continue waiting. Then our food got mixed up. Burritos went to one person instead of enchiladas but we were halfway through before we noticed. We just thought the burritos got smaller. \nWe mentioned this to our server and she said let me talk to the manager and see what we can do. The manager then came over to our table and asked what the problem was. We explained and he said \"So what do you want me to do about it?\"  Really? He then told us that he looked at us several times while we were eating and we \"looked happy\". He argued with us for a bit until I told him to leave the table. I think what upset me the most was his attitude and that he acted like we were just trying to get a free meal or something. \nHe did end up giving everyone a discount but when he brought the check over he said since you are mad at me here is the number to call and complain. ??? What a baby. \nNO we won't be back. Too bad because the food and service are usually good but I have no desire to deal with him again. Maybe he should go take a course i how to behave like an adult.","I cannot comment on very many items but I can tell you that the Baja Chicken Pizza is delicious, the carne asada nachos are excellent and the spinach queso dip, well, let's just say that I would live on that stuff if I could. It is a combination of Velveeta, spinach enchilada filling and baja cream cheese that is nothing less than perfect. It has just the right amount of spice and is not too hot and not too mild. Just right in my opinion. I am on a budget so I cannot afford to eat there often but I go during happy hour and all 3 of the items I mentioned are 1/2 price during happy hour so I get one for eating there and I usually take home at least 2 of the spinach queso dips and eat them for the next few days. They give you a pretty large portion and a big bag of tortilla chips with each order so each appetizer is enough for me to eat 2 separate meals. It is a great deal for the money and the spinach queso warms up really well too. \n\nThe servers have always been really nice and taken good care of us. I would definitely recommend going during happy hour and trying the spinach queso.","I love the food at Macayo's I have several dishes that I order.  Lately however, I always order a chimichanga with a espinaca con queso sauce.  It is great!  One time I did notice an unpleasant odor but this last time everything was fine and I had a great time!","A little pricey, but very good food and atmosphere.","Very over priced for generic mexican food.  The salsa is like seasoned ketchup.  I asked for something spicier and got roasted habenero.  It wasn't bad.  The margaritas were decent.  \nWe had two burrito dinners and a fajita plate.  Also 1 beer and 1 margarita.  The bill was $66.  $ 45 would be more than fair for what we got.  (The service was good.)","From the outside and the ads I would have thought this place would have been great...service was good...food and beverages were lacking. My glass of sangria was a fail...the smallest glass of sangria I ever had. It was almost like a small glass of red wine with a piece of fruit thrown in as an after thought. My chili rellano was a fail. The pablano pepper wasn't even cooked all the way and the cheese wasn't melted. We will not return again.","A solid Mexican food restaurant and honestly, very surprised that finding good Mexican food in Phoenix can be challenging.  \n\nLocation is in a large shopping plaza with lots of parking.  Very easy to find so you should have no problem getting there.\n\nFood is not bad at all with standard items like burritos, tacos, and chimichangas.  More of an Americanized version of Mexican food but what I value here is the consistency.  We have been coming to Macayo's quite often now and the food is never bad and our experience is always pleasant.  I like getting their combo items of tacos/burritos/enchiladas. \n\nPrice is very reasonable and you can bring your whole family without breaking the bank.","I go to this location every other week for Happy Hour with one of my BFFs. We love it because they know us the moment we walk in and the server puts in our drink and food order the moment she sees us (she knows it by heart!) \n\nWe also get out of there for under $10 each! It's our go to place for sure. I'm super picky about Mexican food if I want an actual meal but for Happy Hour appetizers and drinks you can't beat the price!","Wandered in here on a Friday night. Was seated quickly, and the menu was large...seems like a chain vs. family owned establishment. Not worries.\n\nWe were served by the most timid hipster-faced mumbler I've ever met. Seriously could not understand a word he said. I asked for a kids menu for my 13 year old daughter, and he immediately questioned my motives, asking \"just who is this for?\" I explained that my youngest was 14 and special needs and couldn't read such a vast menu with so many choices.....he awkwardly left the table to get our drinks. He then asked to take our order and I had to ask him again to bring a kids menu to the table. We ask if the guacamole is fresh in house. He said yes, and that he recommended it highly , because he just came out here for his night off to have dinner with a friend and that is what he ordered. Okay, then bring it to us. I am pretty sure that it was the Wholly Guacamole brand from Costco. I buy it all the time, and I know the taste. \n\nI have some recent IBD issues, and have to stay away from beans at all costs, so it was hard for me to find a menu item without beans. I finally settle on a salad that is to have Grilled chicken, calabacitas, parmesan cheese and a blend of mixed greens tossed in Cilantro Lime dressing. I looked up clabacitas and noted it had no beans in it (it was supposed to contain corn, zucchini, sweet and poblano peppers). My salad comes with black beans...At first I was not sure if it was my mistake or theirs, so I ask to see the menu. Sure enough, there is no mention of black beans anywhere on the salad description. When I bring this to the attention of our server, he says \"Oh, this is awkward, I hate it when something like this happens. I don't know what to do....\" Then he mumbled off....awkward really is the only word for the service we received. Our bill came for the full amount, and we paid it. As much as I tried to eat around the black beans, the meal still managed to get me sick.\n\nI might go back just to have mumble mouth serve us again. He was so awkwards he was entertaining. But the food really wasn't good enough to warrant a second try.-","Consistently good service.   Food is always good too.  We stop here on our way to and from Tucson several times a year.   They serve Sonoran style food,  as is typical in Arizona,  and they do it right!  Their salsa is the BEST!!!  I mean it, best I've had in 40 years of eating out in the southwest.  I just love the right amount of onion and cilantro,  and Macayo's is perfect!  Beware though,  if you purchase the bottled stuff they have for sale, it is NOT the same and not any better than any other store bought salsa (which none of,  in my opinion, are worth buying).  It's a great small chain of restaurants.","Make sure you try their Baja Sauce! Delicious.","Nice! I have been here two times now and both were fantastic. Sadly i have gotten the same thing both times so i can not say if everything is good but from how good what i did eat was i would say there isn't any real chance of it all not being fantastic.","Macayo's used to be decent but over the years the food has gone downhill. I refuse to eat here and only went because we met friends there. The salsa taste like it comes from a can, the food is far from authentic. If you're in the area, Manuel's is a better alternative. If  you're looking for real mexican food, go to Tony's or Zamora's.","We went there on New Years Eve. My husband got fajitas, and I got quesadillas. My husband said his fajitas were very oniony, had a few spicy peppers, and very little anything else. My quesadillas were permeated with onions and spicy, spicy soggy green peppers (which I don't recall as being warned of those on the menu) so I took one bite and couldn't eat any more of it. It was gross and waaayyy too spicy for me to eat. The only thing I liked was my husband's strawberry margarita, which had booze in it, compared to my non alcoholic version (I'm pregnant). I had a sip of his and it was yummy. My daughter drank most of mine. She ate a lot of chips and wouldn't touch my quesadilla. We won't bother eating there again. What a bummer.","Overpriced wanna be Mexican food. Never again! First and last visit. Tasteless overpriced food. I guess.my famiIy prefers authentic and this is not that. If you enjoy Americanized flavorless food, this place may be for you.  \n\nThey had a guy making ballon animals and he kept making eye contact with my children yet never made his way to our table.\n\nFor aSaturday evening we were seated rather quickly and the place was crowded. Seating way too tight. Felt we were dining with the group next to us \n\nFood bland no seasoning. Chips stale and cold with meh salsa. Margarita was good tho, only good thing about that visit \n\nRather hit up Raul and Theresas","Macayos has great Lunch time Specials! I had the Chicken Fajitas which comes with sour creme, guacamole and salsa and only 9.99! They were delicious! They also make very good Magaritas with different specials!The atmosphere is very Rocky Point and we love the decorations very festive!","I don't know what has happened at the macayo's in Goodyear.  When you walk in there is an overwhelming sewer odor.  At one visit we just passed it off to possible plumbing problems at the time bit we have been back several more times and this gassy odor continues to be bad.  This used to be one of our favorites places to go, however until they fix this we won't be back.   We have also left the last few times with unhappy stomachs ... Don't know if the odor and the food are related ... But hard not to think that.   I hope the Macayo's management corrects this problem because we really do like the food, service, and atmosphere of this restaurant.","UGH... Three weeks ago my husband and I went into the Macayo's restaurant in Goodyear and smelled a TERRIBLE smell.  The hostess explained that the sewer had backed up, but if you go to the back of the restaurant you really can't smell it.  REALLY?!?!?  I don't think so... and I think it must be against a health code someplace to keep the doors open when your sewer is backed up.  The bathrooms are located right next the front doors when you walk in.  There a lot of people in the restaurant eating even with the stench.  I can't believe they continued to serve food, the restaurant should have been closed.  I'll never go back there again.  Disgusting!","The food is average, the prices are a little high, the salsa is okay, the service, is mediocre, but the balloon guy is great!","Went here on vacation for spring training at the reccomendation of my Mom and Sister. The food was spot on, and friendly service at a great price, good size portions too!","-An acceptable chain restaurant to take \"out-of-town\" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.\n\n-Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any \"...Berto's\" type place in the Valley!\n\n-Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.\n\n-$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.\n\n-Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from \"salsa breath\".\n\n-Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?\n\n-Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.\n\n-Parking is plentiful.\n\n-Separate entrance in the back for take-out.","Never...ever...again. There is too much other good food around town.","Just another mediocre chain restaurant..","I love Macayo's but not this location.  Went in the other night and the service was terrible.  The food was so so and the whole environment just seemed like we were bothering them by being there.  Every staff member we encountered was rude.  We sat outside on the patio which is dirty for being a restaurant especially.  Happy to go to many of the other locations but won't be returning to this one.","I was not a fan.\n\nThey used an anaheim chili in the relleno... BIG mistake. It is poblano or nothing, people!\n\nI also tried a green corn/green chili tamale. Too sweet. Not enough green chili. Just meh.\n\nThey did have a good habanero based salsa by request... unfortunately, like most Mexican joints these days, the chips you used to dip in the salsa sucked by all measures.\n\nAnother Mex restaurant disappointment. A pattern has definitely developed.","Macayo's has gone down hill over the years, quality of food doesnt seam to be the same. Happy Hour is good along with the chips and salsa. \n\nHowere this can be a good place to go with a large family.","My wife and I go to Macayo's for happy hour.  The food is always fresh.  We usually sit at the bar and the service is fast and friendly.  We will return many times in the future.","This is an Arizona standard. They have many locations throughout the valley. Great place for good casual Mexican with your family. Very Catina looking interior decor, somewhat commercialized. Not your hole in the wall place. I eat here with my mom, dad and husband every time I'm back home. Good service, very neighbor friendly...prob. because I always run into someone from high school. \n\nGreat for groups too (I had my rehearsal dinner at the Ahwatukee location.)","The only times that I have gone here was because we had a family gathering and some nut always picks this place.\n\nI do not like it ...at all. I have gotten sick after eating here twice and the service has always been terrible.","This location in Goodyear is the only location I will eat from. The people are always friendly and the service is good. It is clean as far as I can see. The food is decent enough that we do go on occasion.\n\nI have been to other locations and found them to be awful but Goodyear is spiffy doodle with me.","eh, no thanks!\n\nIt is just american-ized Mexican food and there is something in their cooking (spice/oils) that tends to not agree with me later so we have stopped going.","I love this place!  Every time I go back home I have to stop by.  I usually am only a fan of cheap fast Mexican food but this place is definitely special.  The fajitas are especially great, try the shrimp.  \n\nThe drinks are awesome and they have some of the best collector cups ever.  I have the coconut carved to look like a monkey (a drink cup goes on the inside, even has a hole in the lid for a straw) and my husband/brother/dad all have the ChaCha Margarita cup (they like to call her ChiChi because she is anatomically correct).  I think you get a discount if you bring the cups back.\n\nThe sopapillas are to die for.  So soft and covered in honey and powdered sugar.  I always end up getting it all over myself but it is OK because then I get to lick it off later.\n\nThe interior is pretty cool, looks like a feisty Mexican cantina, including wooden birds and mariachi mannequins.  There is usually a balloon guy wandering around who will make you a seriously cool balloon animal/hat/whatever you want for a few bucks."],"business_id":"K45lBLY0uTnPduIOw7U_BQ","name":"Macayo's Mexican Kitchen","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Very clean and friendly spot in south phoenix that I will most likely visit again. I wanted so bad to give four stars but will most likely review again on my second visit. The soda I wanted was out in the machine and the surf and turf burro was supposed to have chipotle shrimp and it seemed like it was missing sauce or seasoning on it. Everything else I saw there looked very good and I wish I had more time on my original visit to study the menu to order the wipeout burro which looks fantastic and has a yelp deal. The counter staff and cooks are all very friendly and well kept and you can tell they are trying their best to put a good light on their establishment. The salsa was fresh and tasted very good. The burrito was a good portion and filled me up for the rest of the day. The crane Asada and Quac tasted great. Overall I would recommend this place to those looking for a good bite where good restaurants are hard to find area wise.","The BEST tortas in the valley, hands down. My wife and I have tried them all over, including the popular spots, and this place has it down pat. In fact, everything we've tried hs been great. It's nice to have a local, family-owned spot that actually puts out a good product in this area!","I wish you could include half stars in the ratings.  I am not giving these guys 2 stars because the food was not bad but it wasn't to my expectations based on the ratings other Yelpers left.  Mexican Food for me is very subjective and I was raised on it in the southwest, Chicago and Mexico.  You either have been raised on Mexican food or you have not.  I had the carne asada tacos.  I will not bash these guys nor recommend another Mexican restaurant because everyone deserves to do business.   This is the first time I have not agreed with my fellow Yelpers but will try this place one more time trying something else.","I've lived a mile away from Gordas for a few years now and for some reason have never stopped by here, despite wanting to. I finally stopped in for lunch today and was very pleased with the Surf and Turf burro. After reading other reviews I plan to go back very soon and get some fish tacos and some chimi's.\nThe place was very clean. The young lady behind the counter was very friendly and our food was ready very quickly.","I had the fish and shrimp tacos and my wife had the carne asada tacos, both were equally awesome! We will definately be back!","Great people and great food at a great price!\n\nWe recently relocated our business to this area and stop in here about 2x a week now. The girl at the counter is always super friendly. The food is always fresh and well made.\n\nThis is like Filibertos but much better IMO. Good stuff.\n\nTry the Surf n Turf or the Adovada!","Had a three day class in South Phoenix and by the last day we were tired of the chain restaurants. We decided to try Gordas. I am so glad we did. Wish I would have found this place the first day I was there, I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else.  I'll be back (even if I have to make a special trip).  Great food!","It's a proximate lunch spot for me, and I admit, that has something to do with why I like it so much.  But beyond that, they serve some really incredible fish tacos.  Also, they are super nice folks.","I'm going to be honest just like I will do with any review,\n\nI'll start if with the service, it was excellent. They were attentive and very very nice and polite, granted I was only there to order something to go but they were still overly nice. The place is super clean and I think anyone can appreciate a clean restaurant. The salsa bar was clean and the salsas were very tasty I took one of each because I'm a salsa fan but no guacamole at salsa bar, no bueno. \nI'm from Mexico born and raised on \"real\" Mexican food, which is where my problem started. I think the \"three starts\" I'm giving could have been because I ordered the wrong things based on my taste. I ordered the \"Gordas Wipe out\" which is a burrito made enchilada style. If you are Mexican than you know that huge burritos aren't really Mexican and that enchilada style is really not a Mexican thing so on my part that was a mistake for ordering that.  The burrito was good I'm not going to say it was bad or anything it was good and it was huge! I didn't finish it and I was stuffed. The problem was that my clumsy self didn't really read the menu right and it could have been because the overly nice person at the register wouldn't stop recommending me things and I'd rather listen to them than read the menu. My passion is pastor/adovada, but like another person in a new restaurant I wanted to taste everything. The person at the register kept insisting on the wipe out stating it has a little bit of everything and so when I heard everything I imagined adovada asada and chicken, I don't know why that came to my head, maybe cause I had just gotten done explaining how much I love adovada/pastor. Well I get my food and come to work to eat the nice huge burrito. I have no clue what the guy meant by \"a little bit of everything\" because it only had rice beans shredded beef and sour cream.  I guess I was still stuck and getting three meats that I was disappointed like I said it could have been my fault.\n\nThe prices are also a bit high. Being that I work in the area I can proudly say that I have been to almost every restaurant and food truck in this area and this has by far been the one with the highest prices, I paid around 7.50 for the burrito but once again it was big. Yes I get it, it's not a food truck so It doesn't have food truck prices but in this area tacos for over 1.50 are pricy specially Baja tacos because they are small, I think here they are over 2 bucks. Now they have great reviews so it might have just been me and what I ordered and my mistakes. Although I think it's a bit pricy for the area I will give it a second chance because of the friendly service and the cleanliness of the place and also because I love to support locally owned businesses. \n\nI promise that when I go the second time and it blows me away like it did most of the people who are writting reviews on here I will change this review and update with a new one.","Being new to the area we decided to give Gordas a try. The whole family was glad we did. I ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were delicious. I especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious. My husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing I had ordered one myself even if they were big (lunch for the next day). My daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans. There were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. I only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer. We will definitely be back though the food was that good.","I live in the SoMo area and I remember waiting (patiently) for Gorda's Baja Taco to open.  Well, it's been a few year since it opened and it's been worth the wait.  I absolutely love Gorda's.  First of all, the staff is incredible.  I feel like Gorda's is my Cheers...they always greet me by name and sometimes start making my order before I even get all the way to the register.  \n\nNow, on to the food.  Everything I've had is great.  I can be a picky eater; however, I know that whatever I get taste fresh and homemade.  these recipes are not downloaded from the internet!\n  \nMust haves: Carne Asada Burrito is my favorite.  the meat is fresh, tender and peppery.  something to note: the burrito's here are HUGE! you could split one between two people.  Pork adobada tacos are amazing.  they are in the vein of street tacos and they are delicious.  The carne asada fries are also amazing, but you might want to share them!\n\nGorda's has a great salsa bar that has three different types of salsa, onions, cilantro and carrots/cucumbers.  The salsa is top-notch and you get to use as much as you want.  \n\nI have taken friends, co-workers and family to Gorda and everyone loves it!","We go here a lot, and usually have an assortment of mini tacos.  We love them all.  Very friendly staff, great prices, quick service.  Our favorite mini tacos are the fish and the adobada. YUM!","We have lived in the Laveen area for a while, and today was the first time we tried Gordas.  Wow!  The fish tacos that I had were delicious.  We will definitely be back....who knows, it might be tomorrow.  It might be dangerous having this restaurant so close to our house.","Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.\n\nEasy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.","We got tacos here and they were legit...street tacos meat and pico...tacos adobada are very tasty.","EXCELLENT! We were actually impressed by the cleanliness and unique decor upon arrival.  We had the Carne Asada tacos and the Fish burrito.  The tacos were really good.  Fresh and seasoned really well...  The fish burrito was PHENOMENAL.  The fish alone would rival even the best fish and chips I've ever had.  Will 100% definitely be back soon!","I finally decided to stop by Gordas yesterday after driving past it for almost two years now.. I'm so glad that I stopped in and grabbed some tacos! The customer service was awesome. Very friendly and helpful staff. They recommended that I tried anything with adobada, and I'm glad I chose that. I ordered two adobada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos are a little smaller, but they load them up with meat and pico de gallo. Next time I will order three tacos or maybe try one of their burritos. They also have a clean salsa bar there which was stocked with good tasting salsa and toppings such as cilantro and onions. If you are thinking about going to Gordas, do yourself a favor and get off the computer and go now. You won't be disappointed.","I retract my past review ....very very tasty and delicious! 5 stars! I had a chicken burrito chimi style, and 2 carne asada tacos, both fantastically seasoned! I will be a return customer for sure! \n\nThe staff is very friendly and they take a personal interest in their customers. The girl at the front counter remembered me from my last visit, even though it was some time ago. Another customer came in while I was deciding on what I wanted to get, and she remembered that customer as well! A+ service and quality!\n\nGood place to go for lunch or dinner, rather you just want a nice place to sit and eat, or you are in a hurry and want something fresh and delicious!","I was in the mood for some fresh tacos so decided to try Gordas out. It was my first experience. Very good but would like to get more bang for my buck. I would definitely go back and try something new from, but they seriously need to think about super sizeing their tacos.  Was to small for the price you will pay.","Anything on there menu that I have ordered is always made the way you want it and it's so damn good! I love this place!","Delicious and everyone who works there is so nice & friendly. I love this place!","We went to Gordas last week and wow... we were really happy with our meal.  We wanted to try lots of different things, so we shared the Chile Verde Sopes (Amazing), the Crispy Beef taco, the Carnitas taco, the Adobada taco, the Carne Asada taco, the Carne Asada Fries, and a Quesadilla!  Without exception, everything we tried was fantastic.  They also have these little spicy carrots at the salsa bar.  Yum.\n\nHighly recommended.","Pretty darn good tacos. I crave them constantly.","Food was great! Shrimp & Fish tacos are Bomb! Salsa is good! And staff is friendly! Highly recommend!","I'm from Texas on business in Phoenix. I had the grilled fish tacos they were delicious. Fresh with good flavor. I would recommend them to others. They even have a salsa bar. The only thing is their POS system is outdated, it would help to have a better description on receipts for expense purposes.","There's not much in the way of good, non-chain restaurants to choose from in Laveen, so thank heavens for Gorda's Baja Tacos. They have great, fresh, authentic Mexican food! The fish tacos in particular are amazing, and the salsas are also impressive. And to top it off, the owners and staff are very friendly, helpful and attentive.  Finally a great restaurant in Laveen!","The Baja Tacos are definitely amazing; but what puts this place head and shoulders above all the Mexican joints in the area is the Carne Asada! \n\nI'm telling you-- you've never had REAL steak at an affordable (prices are great, too!) Mexican place before! My first time I had the tacos-- and they were surprisingly good, but my next time I had a burrito and the first thing I tasted was a mouth full of REAL marinated steak! And super tender, too.\n\nI'm soooo happy I found this place, as I judge most Mexican eateries by their burritos and carne asada-- and this place is absolutely the best!!","Good guacamole and the carne asada was very tender. Good salsa.","Food was excellent menu selection is huge! one of the best I've been too!","This place is fantastic, I don't come here enough, the food is amazing, service is great and the establishment clean","Second time I come here and both times I've had great food. There's closer Mexican restaurants by my house,  but the food here taste really good. \n\nI had there carne asada Sopes today and enjoyed every bite.  There shrimp cesadillas are great too!","Really good food, not very busy. The fish tacos are worth the trip. Two tacos is perfect, 3 will leave you stuffed. Figure $3.25/taco. Enjoy!","Everyone raves about the tacos, but I say try the Torta's (Mexican sandwiches)!    This is our favorite little go-to local Mexican food establishment - way better than any of the other's around Laveen.","The food was so amazing, I had literally got up, walked to the window and told the cook that it was delicious! I had a order of 2 adobada tacos and a drink of dr.pepper, I love how the soda machine wasn't behind the counter (free refills) I loved that they had a fully stocked salsa's, lemons, spicy carrots.\n\nI found that it was shocking the place wasn't as busy as it should be. I felt like if the word got more spread around about this restaurant, they would be swamped! Maybe I just came @ a dead hour, who knows. This was my first time and definitely not my last!\n\nBesides the food...The woman working the register has a beautiful smile :)","This place is really good. My first visit, I had a carne asada burrito. It was fresh and big, it was delicious. The girl at the counter was very pleasant. Their salsa bar is fully stocked. Definetly better than any *Bertos...","Gordas' fish tacos are on par with Wahoos in SoCal and The Hula Grill in Waikiki.\nIf you want to taste one of the best fish tacos in all of Phoenix Metro, pack-up the kids, dog and grandma and head for Gordas.\n\nGordas delights on so many levels, I have to give it my highest Diego rating in the history of e.v.e.r. They're just that good.\n\nOn a personal note, I'd like to encourage anyone reading this to try Gordas at least once. Mainly because I know you'll be hooked on them like I was, increasing the likelihood Gordas will grow and flourish and I get to continue to enjoy the place.\n\nThe restaurant business is tough, with it's 95% failure rate.\nTo let a restaurant like Gordas succumb to these sobering stats due to a lack of customers would be an outright travesty. Especially when they're this good.\nIn short, I hope Gordas becomes the Wahoos of Phoenix, they deserve it.\n\nIf you want a taco, forget Jack-in-the-box, or any 'mexican' joint claiming a 'berto' in its suffix, there's really only one place to go.\nGordas.\n\nPS\nBy the way, your wife can come with you, grandma and the dog too, but only on the condition that she take a big healthy whiff of the fish taco before eating it. \nMaybe then she'll finally appreciate what you've gone through all these years.","Being the whimsical guy i am, i decided to go for it with Gordas. I saw on Yelp that it had lots of positive reviews and there wasn't anything else nearby but fast food. The place was somewhere between Filibertos and Chipotle but in all the right ways. Fresh salsa bar was fresh! RC cola in the fountain: something you dont see often, but nice. I had the surf and turf burrito. It was huge like Chipotle, but tasted way better. It reminded me what Mexican food is supposed to taste like (meaning not some combo of trendy flavors like chipotle). It had shrimp, steak, mexican rice and perfectly zippy and fresh-tasting pico de gallo. The staff were really friendly and the food came out fast. Great lunch spot if youre in this area.","So glad this place is nearby!!  Haven't tried everything yet but the fish tacos and fish burrito are delicious!!","Very good, fresh tasting food FULL of flavor! Affordable prices!"],"business_id":"KnLsrf4P9GkWYLNRQLUgsA","name":"Gordas Baja Taco","categories":["Seafood","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Great food...great drinks...everything was perfect, our server and buser were the best we have had in a long time. Food was cooked perfect and everyone was friendly.","I was disappointed with my experience here.  I made an order for carry-out early in the evening last week (8/21/2012).\n\nI ordered two ground beef tacos with just meat and cheese.  I could have made way better tacos at home.  The cheese looked it was shredded and tasted like it was from a package at a grocery store.  The beef was bland and had didn't have much flavor.\n\nThe chips for the salsa were stale.  I also ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with cheese and it was almost $12...way overpriced for the amount and the taste.\n\nI would not recommend this place based on my personal experience here.","I went here the other day for lunch and it was very disappointing. I have been to other Manuel's locations and they have been alright, but this one was not very good. I went for lunch and got the pollo especial which is basically a chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese sauce on it. It was pretty gross, the chicken tasted like dish water and there was barely any of the jalapeno sauce on it. Also, it was really soggy, not crispy at all. I did give an extra star because our server was really nice and attentive, however, I would not come here again when there are places like top shelf that make the same dish much better.","I've been going to Manuel's with my family for years. They have very good chips and salsa, it's definitely their strong point. Unfortunately they no longer carry black beans and their refried beans contain lard. As a vegetarian, I cannot eat here any longer unless I want just chips and salsa or a cheese crisp.\n\nSad, sad day :'(","Was I impressed with this place? No. Not at all.\nWhy?\n\nFirst off, it was extremely hot sitting in this place like they had it set at a solid 78-80 degrees. Awesome :|\n\nSecond...A burrito that only comes with pico de gallo and guacamole on the inside with your choice of meat is weird to me. Where you have to pay extra for other ingredients? Stupid! I could understand switching out ingredients. The carne itself was good enough but not good enough for the burrito to be spectacular.\n\nIDK if ill go back some day maybe if someone takes me ill give it a shot again.","over priced for just okay mexican food. \nI would compare my 9$ bean and cheese burrito to one at filliberto's... \nI was also VERY upset that I paid 2.50 for a side of guacamole. ( IT WAS ONLY 2 ONCES) \nNot worth the visit.","Nothing special. Nothing good. Salsa was meh, chips were stale. \nSpinach enchilada was just a bunch of spinach stuffed in a tortilla with white sauce on it. Chicken enchiladas had no flavor. \nThis was our first time here because it's close, we'll make the drive next time to someplace better.","Great service! Great food!! Chips and salsa always fresh. I get the chicken enchilada, so gooood!!","Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town.","One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the world! They've got the BEST salsa and their chips are amazing. One of the best parts about Manuel's is the jalapeño cream cheese that they put on their Pollo Especial. BUT...if you want the best dish they've got...get the Carne Tampiqueña and add some shrimp. You really won't regret it. Drinks are delish...servers are awesome...really nothing to complain about!!","Nice, cozy place.  Come around lunch, the service is more memorable.  Avoid the magician if he's there without shoes.  Try the tampiquena plate.","Manuels was very disappointing.  I ordered taquitos, and it tasted like they were the frozen and just warmed in the oven.  I could bought the same ones at the local grocery store.  Same can be said with the salsa.  It tasted like jar salsa.  It should have been obvious from the lack of cars in the parking lot, on a Friday evening.  The 80's music also did not  fit the atmosphere of a Mexican restaurant.","I have been eating at Manuel's for, well let's just say a LONG time! I used to go to the one on Broadway until it closed. When I lived out of state I ALWAYS stopped at Manuel's on visits! \n\nAs the New Times has announced, they have the best salsa! I know there are various tastes out there and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine is that I like their salsa best, the margaritas, the cheese crisp, the fajitas, wait- it gets better... in N CAL, MI and IL I couldn't find a green corn tamale to save my life, so I learned how to make them and I will say I make them well! But, they are a lot of work and so I am happy to be back in the Valley of the Sun to get them at Manuel's! I prefer their chicken chimis to any place I have been because they actually season it nicely, not just chicken in a deep fried tortilla! The guac is great! Not made with a ton of jalapenos or strange ingredients! The flan is the best I have had! The sopapillas are little now, I kind of like the bigger squares, but they still taste good!\n\nNow, let me tell you about the service! They have some of the greatest staff- Luis, Marcos, Jerry, Carlos, these guys are the BEST!!!!\n\nWell, I will say that the Indian School location has some problems, the flan is curdly and there were a couple other differences, including service. I don't know why this is, but I just go to the one on Southern that I know will be great!\n\nAll in all this is the only place I like to go for Mexican food. I have tried a great many here and in other states and I always go back to my favorite, Manuel's! Maybe I'll see you there sometime!","So happy they got their liquor license back but wish the bartender/ server knew what a Cadillac or perfect margarita was. Had to order from the margarita menu & buy an extra shot of tequila to offset the strong sweet  sour mix. They have the best smooth/ taco sauce but not provided. Chips were cold like out of a bag. I requested extra garnish with my red chili burro, barely got normal amount but didn't get a chance to ask for more, she dropped food and left quickly and did not see her again until we were done. There were 2 occupied tables, maybe she was busy doing side work. I have been to the other Manuel's locations and the service and food is always great.","Good food for the price with excellent atmosphere and staff","Hadn't been here in a long time, so tried it again last night.  We were pleasantly surprised that the food was still as good as we had remembered.  While there was a short wait for a table and the hostess was somewhat unaccommodating, the service was otherwise fine.  We like their salsa and chips, and everything we ordered was well prepared and appetizing.  Will definitely return now that we have tried it again.","This place is always good.  They never disappoint.  Even my picky husband enjoyed his dinner.","We have been here a couple of times and the food has been fairly good but not real consistent. It is obviously a \"turn and burn\" type restaurant and not a true and dedicated Mexican restaurant. If you want fairly consistant and ok food this place will work","Our family ate here a lot when we lived in AZ.  Last night I was in town and my folks wanted to go.  It has not changed a bit!  \n\nOutstanding salsa (you have to ask for the \"hot\" if you want it).  Great thin chips.  Prices seem to have gone up which is disappointing but you get plenty of food.\n\nNothing great to look at, not the best Mexican food in AZ, but good solid stuff.","Typical chain Mexican food, nothing great, but not a bad place to eat if 'typical' is what you are in the mood for.","I'he eaten here twice during the last 45 days - both Sunday nights. The food ROCKS!!! The ambiance is \"feels good\" and the service given by the waiter known as, \"Luis\" was complete. From recommending popular dishes to checking in to ensure satisfaction - Luis is the man! I had \"Pollo Especial\" which was outta sight! My date had vegetarian fajitas and she was pleased with the vegetable selection; noting they were different than other vegetarian fajitas she's had in the area.\n\nEach entree was flavorful, filing and fun. 5 stars - Solid!!!","I hadn't been to Manuel's in probably 5 years. Afterwards, I remembered why. While the food is good, it isn't great. There is better at several other local places. I probably would have given the food a 4 star but the restaurant was so hot that I just wanted out. I am actually someone that likes being warm but when it is over 100 degrees outside, I want to walk into a place and actually notice a difference in temperature. It was to warm to be comfortable. \n\nThe service was quick and friendly. They still have the best fried ice cream around. The chimis are good but not great. The refried beans were a little runny. Salsa is excellent. I would go back for another $15 for $30 deal like we got online but probably not without it. There are just to many choices in the area for a comfortable environment and excellent food.","The food is standard Americanized Mexican but it is still very tasty. The chips were fresh and the salsa was flavorful but not hot. I had the enchiladas and my gf had the fish tacos, both of which were good.\n\nAll of the staff was very nice and helpful.  However the food took a long time to come out.","We really enjoyed the food.  I had the fish tacos and they were really good.  Chips and Salsa were pretty good.  When it came time for the bill we though we were all square.  The server came back and told us the Deal Chicken Coupon had already been used.  We have never been to this restaurant, so we had never used the coupon.  The manager said it was used the day before in a Phoenix location.  We had to pay the entire bill, even though we had invested in 4 coupons for this restaurant.  The restaurant told us to contact the other restaurant to do some leg work.  They told us to contact Deal Chicken.  Deal Chicken told us to contact the restaurant.  Then Deal Chicken called the restaurant when we demanded our money back from Deal Chicken.  Within 5 minutes our Deal Chicken Coupon was good again.  Why they could not figure out that they had made a mistake when we were there waiting for about 30 minutes listening to them tell us we had already used the coupon.  We got our money back from Deal Chicken.  We will never go back.  They never even attempted to contact us to at least apologize.  Treating us like scam artist's instead of new customers!  Too bad we were looking forward to going back after finishing our meal.  Service was not the best.  For anyone who does not know Deal Chicken is a place where you can buy coupons for extra value at the business.","Best Mexican food i've had in the east valley!  Great service, awesome chips and salsa!  I'm sure theres better places in the valley, but this is around the corner from where I live, and we've been regular customers since 2007.  Highly recommend.","1 star from someone from Massachusetts should say enough.  It was unimaginative, unflavorful, uninteresting, I could probably go on with the \"un\" words for quite some time, but I think you get the idea.  I had the Chile Relleno and it felt like I was eating an omelette with some bland chile in it.\n\nThis is Phoenix for crying out loud, there are much better options for Mexican food.  I found one the day after I ate here, it's a bit of a hike, but well worth it.  Check out my review for Los Taquitos in Phoenix for a much better option.","Manuel's is better than your Serrano's or Garcia's but that's not saying much.  The chips and salsa are good. I usually get any variation of their Chimichanga, which is good but I've had better. This place use to be way cooler when they had the green chili costume and they use to dress up and dance for you on your birthday by request. WTF happened? It was the only thing I would look forward to when my wife's family would take me here. Try Cantina Laredo or Cravings before this place.","Manuel's is so good. It's one of our favorite restaurants and I have withdrawal if I don't eat there often enough.  My favorites are their chips and salsa and the chicken fajitas. The best part about this place though is Luis. We now request him every time we go in. Even if it's been quite a while, he remembers us and our order (call me predictable)... Besides, the fajitas are so good, I can't bring myself to get anything else.","Manuel's Mexican Restaurant on Southern Ave. has always offered good, quick Mexican food. I've visited here for more than 10 years, and the food is always consistently high quality. I particularly like the green corn tamale with rice and beans (AKA, \"Mix and Match\"). The shredded beef taco is also tasty. My husband always gets the Fiesta Platter, theoretically an appetizer, because it has a bunch of little items to sample. \n\nFor the past 10 years or so, the same friendly gentleman has served us the chips and wonderful Manuel's salsa. I think it shows that Manuel's is a quality restaurant for someone to work there for so long! Manuel's isn't fancy, but their food and friendly service keeps my family coming back again and again. Try it!\n\nUPDATE: This location has the best \"balloon sculpture guy\" I've ever seen! If you have a kid, call ahead to see what nights the guy works. Yes, he really is that good.\n\n(Note that this review ONLY applies to the Southern Ave. location. We have been very disappointed by other locations...)","It's great to have that favorite place very close to home, the best pizza, best subs, best bar, or your favorite Mexican food. Manuel's on Southern is our favorite Mexican restaurant close to home. We dine here regularly and I've never had a bad meal at this location. I cannot say that for other nearby places we frequent.\n\nThe staff is prompt, friendly and competent. We've never waited long for a table, food, drink or a check. And we have a favorite waiter, Ian the wannabe Mexican.\n\nMy go-to dish is the Three Amigo enchiladas but there are many good dishes I go back to when dining here. When I need a Sonoran food fix, this is my place. There's only one other cantina in the east valley I put at the same level as Manuel's. My fondness has reach the point where I assume any negative review comes from a person who does'nt know what they're talking about.\n\nMy only slightly negative comment will be their discontinuation of Bohemia Beer, and they could have a better tap and tequila selection.","Very very good salsa - almost as good as my favorite, Los Gringos Locos in Apache Junction.\n\nI enjoyed my dinner here. I was in a very large group and our server was helpful and kept everyone's orders organized. Super yummy mango margaritas, too!","That's one good things about being a restaurant critic or a fact checker! My wife and I believed that mexican food is great in this restaurant . I don't usually don't order other food than Green Corn Tamale. Although, my last try of  Carne Asada was not that good and our recent visit we found out that  both our forks was cleaned well. Still, I will give this restaurant a five star review because of your unsurpassed green corn tamale.  We will be back next time and check those corrections  and will be firm in making the next review. So, always on the look out, Keeps those utensils clean and maintain a standard in your food preparation. We promise we will come and visit again.","wow. i REALLY like average mexican food.  i grew up with manuel's, the original one in phoenix.  and i'm happy to say, this food is familiar and comforting to me.  it may not be the best, i can see how some may think it's just the worst. not me. me likey.","Great Mexican Food, I had 2 tacos w rice and beans yum. My friend had a chimi. We both loved our food and it was nice that they kept the food traditional. They have have great guacamole. The service was friendly and they did a good job. You can tell they appreciate your business.","Not as good as the original in Glendale, but still good.  I had the machaca and it almost tasted a little too sweet, or more like Fajitas do... not my favorite taste for machaca anyway, but great chips and salsa and the kids seem to love their food (lots of options for kids)  Everyone else in the group said the place was a solid 3 stars and that they would come back.  Next time I go to this location I think I will just stick with tacos and see how that goes ...","Just moved into my new house in Tempe and am lucky that this little gem is in my backyard. I've been here twice now and so far I've really enjoyed everything I've had. My favorite so far? The spinach enchiladas are YUM YUM YUMMY!!! I ordered the 3 Amigos Sampler feeling least excited about the spinach enchiladas but they were by far my favorite. Next time I might just order those. Also, they have a skinny margarita! Yay for that!","Manuel's catered the food for my wedding this past weekend in Scottsdale.  All guests said the food was delicious!  The menu consisted of carne asada tacos, spinach enchiladas, rice, beans and calabasitas.  We also had chips, salsa and a fruit tray during the cocktail hour.  The service staff was very kind and helpful.  Additionally, Linda worked patiently with us to include vegetarian and vegan options on the menu.  The vegetarians and vegans loved the food.","Been coming here for YEARS! This family owned local Az style mexican food place is my fave. Everything is always fresh and tasty. Service is always great.","The food was tasty and fresh.  Chips were wam and crispy and salsa was good.  While it was not the greatest Mexican north of the border, it was way above average.  What knocked it out of the park was the service.  Explained to the waiter we were in a hurry for a family reason and we got food right away with check right after it.  Assured us we did not have to rush but had everything ready so we could.  We will bring the kids and return  Good food and great staff.","Que Onda Guero? \nBy The Rue\n\nChimichanga wasn't from the gutter,\nBut I should have eaten peanut butter,\nThe food didn't make me bust a nutter,\nI'll bet you like to drink Coors Cutter.\n\nI will say though the service was great,\nI'm pretty sure my waiter's name wasn't Kate,\nWhy is everyone so full of hate?\nI think this weekend I'll go skate.\n\nThe chips and salsa were unimpressive,\nThe lunch prices were a bit excessive,\nWhen making out I'm not real aggressive,\nAnd I don't get jealous or possessive.\n\nThis place is popular with the older crowd,\nLots of senior citizens speaking loud,\nCome in at happy hour and get yourself plowed,\nGo home with someone well endowed.\n\nAnother thing I liked was their ice tea,\nI'm a fan of taking road trips to sightsee,\nYears ago I sported a goatee, \nBoost your immune system with vitamin C. \n\nTOSTADA!!!","Although there are many other more visually appealing restaurants, the food is what makes the difference. It was great, the carnitas were fantastic and the enchiladas were outstanding! One final note, the flan was clearly made fresh and on-sight. I would defiantly eat there again.","This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix.

{"reviews":["Nice place. Good food. You can smell the salon next door. I had the chimichanga. It comes with more veggies than I wanted but it was good. We would go there again.","Amazing food! I have loved every in I have tired. The chicken tacos are one of my favorites. Everyone should give this place a try.","Good food and fast service from this one.  Breakfast burrito is on par with the best in the area.  Kids love the Carne Asada Fries as well as the Tosinos Fries.","First time here and it's so good! The tortillas are perfect. Food is cheap. Bf and I got breakfast burritos and chips & guac, all really fresh. Salsa has the pepper kick that I miss at most taco joints like this. Best hole in the wall Mexican fast food I've had since moving from Tucson.","Great food and price point . This was our first time here, but after the first bite all 3 kids asked if this can be our new go to Mexican food place. We ordered bean and cheese burrito, cheese quesadilla, carne asada tacos, and rolled tacos. My kids and I enjoyed all of it.  I especially liked the flavor of the beans. My 8yr old son proclaimed this is his new favorite place. The food wasn't greasy. We did add a bit of salt to the rolled tacos but I usually do that. I will definitely tell my friends and family give this place a try","Good food","The food is pretty authentic. The rellenos are home made. If you want quick Mexican food this is a great place.","Finally a taco shop in my area with flavor!!! I've ate at most of the taco shops in the east valley and I would either drive to Phoenix or Scottsdale to get decent taco shop food! Ladies working there were nice and it was priced great. I will defiantly go back.","Great carne asada tacos and Pico de gallo. Chips and guacamole were super fresh. Will definitely be back!","Sooo good. Friendly employees and the food is fresh and way better than any other fast food Mexican.","This place has awesome food! The price is perfect and have tried all kinds of different things. Def carna asada burrito is a must. I've visiting this place several times and yet to find something that I do not like!","it was average.  food was good, fresh but nothing overly special.  Portions were a bit small though.  I'd go there if I lived close, but not worth an extra drive for.  You won't be disappointed here but you won't be wowed either.","Pretty freakin good mex.  Think it's a notch above Senior Taco and a bit cheaper.  Good salsa.  Think the bar looks small because of how it is arranged, but still good.  My son ordered 4 hardshell tacos with nothing but lettuce and beef.   They got his order correct!  (yay) Worth the trip!  This cooking reminds me of my grandmother's style of Mexican.  There are many different types of \"authentic\" Mexican food, but this one has my vote, as it DEFINITELY reminds me of my Mexican grandmother's cooking.","Super good food and it's family owned/operated so the service was great. The perfect combination if you dig supporting small businesses. Do it.","Quite magnificent.  Too bad its in a low traffic zone, cars will pass by this place unknowing to what lies beyond the front doors.  Absolutely awesome.","I live around the corner and thought I would check this place out. I love Mexican food and thought that this place did a decent job. I thought it was very similar to Filibertos, nearly identical although not as greasy. I thought the prices were also a bit less. The chile verde, cheese quesadilla, rice, beans & taquitos were all very good. I will be back to try some of the other menu items.","When they have lengua and Cabesa on the menu you know you are in the right place. \n\nStraight up this is some good classic Mexican food. Street tacos, fresh made orders and friendly staff. Great prices help as well. \n\nI will definitely keep coming back here. I usually get the Tacos al\npastor and am very satisfied. Daughter gets pollo asado burrito and she loves it. \n\nReally if you are looking for a great Mexican place this is it. It isn't fine dining and no table service but is tasty tasty!!!","Excellent! Food is authentic and flavorful!Completely reminds me of my moms home cooked food. First time I tried the sopes and hard tacos, both delicious. On my 2nd visit I had the chili rojo and I was not disappointed, again super delicious!","Loved the food. I have been a few times and every item I have ever ordered is fresh, hot and really good. Only complaint is my cabesa mini tacos were average. I like more substance to my cabesa tacos. Other than that, DELICIOSO. Great salsa, clean restaurant, friendly staff. Oh... And their dishes can be made Gluten-free! Yay for Celiac friendly restaurants!!","Our family loves Tosinos! We've eaten in and taken out, and the service is always quick! The staff is friendly and accommodating. Our food has always been great. We've tried the Carne asadas fries, the Super nachos, bean and cheese burrito, quesadilla, California burrito, and torta. My husband thinks cream should be included on the torta, which was his only complaint, but otherwise it's yummy. The meat is always yummy, even our 11 month old like it! The store is always clean, which is a must! It's definitely a place we'll continue to frequent as long as we live in Gilbert!","Really solid food, very clean restaurant. It's not too greasy like some other fast food Mexican places that can leave you feeling not so great afterwards. This building has struggled keeping restaurants in here even though they've all been good. Come support this place so we don't lose another small business fast food joint!!\nOn the flip side, prices might be a tad high. Wouldn't mind some daily deals or coupons.","Love this place! The food is always fresh and the cashiers are approachable and friendly.","One of the best burritos in the valley.  \n\nTongue Tacos? \n\nYes, please!\n\nThis little hole in the wall is great if you want to get some really great mexican food.  We love it every time we visit here.","Delicious! Authentic! Nice Staff!","Cheap, fast, decent atmosphere, and great flavor. You can't go wrong at Tosinos. We stepped in on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all. The wall menu is digital, with pictures of their various items scrolling through the screens.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito ($4.75). At less than $5, this was a great deal. The burrito was made in just a few minutes, huge and filled to the brim with lots of carne asada meat, guacamole, onion, and tomato. The salsa bar on the side had 2 different red sauces, a green sauce, and lime wedges, which were great condiments to compliment the burrito. The nicely grilled tortilla held all the ingredients in well.\n\nThe restaurant has a lot of booths for people to sit at, and compared to other places that serve similar quickie Mexican food (Los Favoritos, Filibertos), the atmosphere here is a step up from them!\n\nDefinitely a new favorite for Mexican food in this area!","We went here again tonight to give it another try and ya know I just don't like it. I really wish I did. I feel like everything is over salted. \n\nI had carne Asada tacos and I wish they would buy better meat. It just tasted cheap.","Just got scolded by the restaurant for being so negative about their restaurant. Professional thanks!\n\nNot EVERYONE has to like your food!","I had the carne Asada nachos! Pretty good, super loaded with carne Asada, beans, pico guac and sour cream n cheese! Shareable for sure! Place is small but cute and clean.","I'm glad I gave this place a chance.. I wanted some good Mexican food. The food here reminds me of my mom's cooking. Great place! Very clean! Enjoyed my sopes with carne asada! Super yummy!","This place is a hidden gem that produces excellent food at very low prices. Their tacos are amongst the best I've ever had in Arizona and at $1.15 can't be beat. The food is incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly. Everytime I come in I get excited at hearing the food sizzle on the griddle because I know it is going to be awesome. This place will not disappoint!","Amazing! Fresh, fast, delicious!! Love this place!!! Would def recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food with a delicious kick. I can't get enough.....Thank you Tosinos!!!!","I just have to say that I REALLY like this place, I'm from Mexico City and believe me I've been in many many places of Mexican Food, Tosinos is the real thing!! the quality is fabulous, the  portions are generous, the place is nice and clean, and the owners are very friendly. I'm just very happy that it's just few minutes away from where I leave. Did I say that they close at 11?? Yeah!!","Our first time checking this place out. We loved it! The burritos are great. The salsa was very tasty and the chips were fresh and hot. Yummy! Fresh made when you order it. \n\nGive this place a try.","Very delicious food and great prices. We read the great reviews and decided to give it a try.  The tacos are amazing.  The carne asada fries are definitely a must have as well.","I saw the reviews and gave it a try. Great selection and the burrito I ordered was awesome. Flavorful with some good sauces to chose from. \nQuick service was a bonus.","My husband and I really enjoyed their food.  I had the carne asada burrito and my hubby had the mini tacos.  They use fresh tortillas instead of store bought ;).we will definitely be coming here again!  Loved it!","Just ok. \n\nTortillas are great! But everything else needed a serious dash of salt! \n\nMe and the hubs got our food to go and it was so awkward in the restaurant. Smelled like Lysol and it was so quiet even though there were 5 other families in there. They are in need of some music! My husband was joking that the lights were interrogation lights. So bright and spotlights almost.\n\nI would go back. I would tell someone to try it but not my favorite.","I came in here from a recommendation from a friend - and I HATE mexican food, absolutely can't stand any part of it.  BUT! The other people in my party really wanted to check it out so we did.  The service was friendly, the ambiance was kind-of fast food-ish, but still very well up kept and nice.  My food was terrific.  This coming from a person who hates mexican food, haha.  The other people in my party LOVED their food too.  Will definitely be looking forward to coming back. Job well done!!"],"business_id":"OCGwX6LFoOp0grDXpe8x5Q","name":"Tosinos Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!  The food is always amazing, and hot and super yummy!  I've visited this establishment multiple times at different hours of the day and have always had amazing service and amazing food!  This is my go to place for mexican food!!  hands down in looooooove!","Whenever I get those late night cravings or after a night of drinking, my boyfriend and I always come here for some good food. \n\nThe interior is small, but from what I've seen, it's always been clean. The staff is friendly and food comes out quick. I always get the carne asada nachos and I have never been disappointed. Don't forget to grab some pickled jalapenos and carrots, they're always fresh and crunchy. \n\nLaurita's beats Roberto's, hands down.","Solid food, quick prep, but more importantly they have avocado sauce. My childhood taco shop in LA had it, but they folded years ago, I have been searching for a place that has solid burritos and the special green sauce in Vegas. Lauritas is it. Good quick and cheap.","It's pretty much Roberto's without the convenience of the drive thru. We Yelped other Mexican places and came across Laurita's.\n\nMy husband had a Carnita's Tacos plate and I just had cheese with tortilla chips. I know boring but I ate waaay too much in Vegas and I just wanted a snack. My husband said he prefers the beans at Roberto's. The cleanliness was meh but heck it is cheap and a little hole in the wall. Tacos were good and prices were decent.\n\nNice little change from Roberto's.","Laurita's is way better than any of the Roberto's I've been too. Very authentic. Homemade everything. They have so much on the menu I haven't been able to try them all. Tacos and burritos are always great. Also with it being open 24 hours - huge plus for me and my crazy hours. I had a Carne Asada super burrito and loved it. The salsa was on point. Definitely going back!","Not bad.  Any time of day or night get some pretty good Mexican food, good size portions for a good price.  Save your calories for this place.  The taste is good, too!","I don't know if the fact I was sober, or read previous reviews caused my visit to Laurita's to be so disappointing.\n\nI was hungry, craving enchiladas, driving around aimlessly, we checked Yelp and decided to try Laurita's, after reading all of the reviews about their \"cheap, amazing food.\"\n\nLooking at the menu, the \"cheap\" part of the reviews was instantly disproved. Figuring we were hungry, there already, and willing to try it, we went ahead and ordered. \n\nMy wife's order went through pretty much without a hitch. I tried ordering my food, then asked a question about how much a side of rice was. The cashier's mind went on the fritz and couldn't grasp that I wanted two plates of food and a side of rice. She kept asking questions in a circular conversation. I had to just walk away.\n\nMy wife attempted to pay with her card. Their machine asked them to input the last four digits of the card. What did they input? Nearly every combination BUT the last four. I will explain. Let's say this is the card #: \nABCD EFGHIJ KLMNO\n\nThey entered KLMN (three times).\nThey entered the four digit security code once\nThey also entered IJKL, JKLM and perhaps even GHIJ.\n\nThis should have been a major red flag. If you can't count to four, how can you properly prepare our food?\n\nOur food was brought out, and I attacked it with the fervor of a cheetah on an African savannah, Impala in it's grasp.\n\nOnce more, the Disappointment-O-Meter jumped through the roof. When I order cheese enchiladas, I would like cheese enchiladas; not, shredded cheese wrapped in a corn tortilla, drenched in sauce, and with a splash of melted cheese on the top. If I wanted to eat a tortilla filled with cold, shredded cheese, I don't need to pay $2.50 each for that.\n\nThe chicken enchilada was a little better, however, after such a weak offering in the cheese enchilada arena, Laurita would need to have served me a mind blowing pair of chicken enchiladas to make up for it. \n\nTheir food was mediocre at best. I can see how drunk people may think it is amazing. Then again, you could feed some Vegas drunks from a dumpster and get the same reaction.\n\nIf you want overpriced, bad, undercooked food, with extreme frustration when attempting to order and pay, go to Laurita's.","This place is AWFUL. They never get your order right and last time I was there they tried to tell me it was $27 for 12 rolled tacos. You've got to be kidding me. They charge extra for everything and their hot sauce bar is disgusting. Not even drunk food worthy.","This my first review, but have eaten here before. Stay away from the nachos, all they do is melt cheddar cheese over chips so, when the chips and cheese get hard they get stuck together and cheese is soon oily. The Chicken Chimichanga is very good. yummy with sour cream of course. \nGoing to try there tacos today, not your typical taco bell. Made with real tortilla.","Great substitute for oxnard cali taco shops. Burrito size varys on who makes it! thats one thing i dont like... always ready for me 10mins after i call in my order.\n\n\nwasn't great today. Dayshift cooks dont cook like laurita herself.","great food and fast ,and cheap","This is definitely one of my favorite late night, bad decision dining choices. I love the rolled beef tacos smothered in guacamole and cheese. Carne Asada tacos or tostada. The carne Asada nachos are awesome, but you need someone to share them. The green sauce salsa is my favorite. I could almost drink it. I eat here often enough but I never really thought about writing a review. I mean everyone knows what they are getting with a place like this, but the last time I was there, I changed my mind. The counter guy seriously washed his hands at least 3 times while I was there. I was the only customer. I was very impressed with this excellent display of good sanitation. He washed his hands before he took my order, after he took my order and again before he handed me my food. Cleanliness like this really makes me confident in a place.","The BEST Mexican food I have had yet in Las Vegas! \nI had a tamale and the rolled tacos.\nThe tamale came dressed up with sauce, cheese, tomato and other goodies! Very yummy! \nThe rolled tacos were also very delicious and filling!\nWould totally come back again!","Love this place, better than Robertos!\n\nI love everything.  The workers are friendly, there jalapenos and carrot mix is the bomb.com!","This place has never let me down. the food is fresh and quick. I usually order the California burrito but last time i ordered the three tacos and chips. Still delicious, inexpensive AND open 24/7.","My husband and I were looking for mexican food outside of the Las Vegas strip. We are from San Diego county, land of the taco shop on almost every corner. We have plenty of Roberto's taco shops, so we wanted to try something new. Our GPS found this one close to the area we were driving so we gave it a chance. The food was good, I had a California Burrito and he had the Carne Asada Burrito. The meat was seasoned appropriately and the portions were a good size. The only thing that lost it for me was their aguas. (jamaica, tamarindo, orchata) Most people don't care about the kind of drink they buy with their meal. But I do. I don't care for that Ole brand of aguas, but I rather drink that than soda. I ordered their version of Jamaica and the water had a very gross taste to it. Not sure if they have cleaned their fountain drink filters lately. But I was turned off by the taste of the drink. It tasted like the water was stale and if a goat bathed in it.\nI did like the food overall, & next time I'll just order a soda and deal it with it.\n\nI am not sure how the Las vegas version of Roberto's is but we may try that place next time.","Seems like a carbon copy of Roberto's or Don Tortaco. Cheap, tasty mexican food. I would give it more stars IF there was ever a clean table in the place. Seems like everytime I go in there is crumbled up taco all over the table or seats. I also wish that their enchilada sauce had a little more pep in its step and the cheese on the inside was actually melted. You can't go wrong with chicken tacos or rolled tacos tho! Summer yummy.","If you want a great deal, and BEST authentic Mexican food Laurita's is where you need to eat. It is quick, it is good, it is worth more than they charge.","This place is close and cheap. \n\nWhat more do you want? \n\nAlright,  I guess cleanliness and tasty food are musts as well. This restaurant has all of that. The food is great for what you're paying for and is cheap. It's not gourmet food by any means,  but it is good and great for a college student budget.  \n\nSteer clear of the obvious American items mainly to please the people oblivious of Mexican cuisine and you're good to go. \n\nDefinitely craving some Al pastor right now.","I classify this type of Mexican spots by my level of soberness or drunkness however you rather call it my party people. Laurita is on the \"damn im drunk and need food asap\" category.. Not as low as robertos \" FOOD NOW cause regardless im gonna vomit it\" category but down there. And its not a bad thing trust me ..its just not the food for me.\n\nTheir portions are big and generous but not high on quality. But we both know that this place is not aiming for 5 stars..The \"damn im drunk and need to eat asap\" crowd usually shows up late and they love it. But for me, that rather enjoy a little more quality ..its just ok\n\nThe flavor is decent. Its not bad at all , but sometimes its greasy and just kinda have that industrially line cooked kinda flavor but for the price you cant complain. It is a good choice when either your liver is crying for food or when your pocket is thin.\n\nThe location is very centric and clean. Food comes fast and their menu is extensive giving you almost innumerable amounts of combos!. To top this their prices are great . Inexpensive and a lot of food is what some people look for and at Lauritas you can find it.","I really like this place!  The food is so good and fast.  I think the longest we've waited is about 10 minutes to get our food...I would strongly suggest the carne asada plate.  Awesome meat!  There is guacamole on the side, along with rice, beans, and tortillas.  Can't go wrong!  \n\nIt's kind of a random location off of Maryland and Pebble...just look right behind/next to the Shell Station and you'll see it.","After trying Roberto's many times and liking it, we discovered Laurita's...it's less than 5 mins from our house.  We are HOOKED on the Carne Asada Burritos...absolutely the best we've tasted since moving here from So Cal 6 yrs ago.  The meat is so tasty, the guacamole fresh and just the right amount of pico de gallo.  The tortilla is thin, like we like it...and it never falls apart.  The salsa's at the salsa bars are fresh, you can tell they replenish them often.  Such a simple, totally yummy burrito..we go often, probably too often and hardly ever want to try anything else.","I tried this place out today when I was looking for a cheap, quick Mexican joint and it was actually pretty damn good. \n\nI had the El Pastor Plate ($7.50), which usually comes with rice, beans, lettuce and tortillas, but I opted to go without the beans or lettuce. The meat was very juicy with a fantastic flavor, as was the rice. The tortilla was piping hot and I made myself some nice miniature tacos.\n\nI also ordered a side of chips ($1) and tried out one of the salsas. Whichever one I picked was delicious. It was the red one that didn't have seeds in it. The perfect amount of spice without being so hot that there's no flavor.\n\nI would definitely say I enjoyed this place far more than Don Tortaco, Roberto's, Fillipito's, Tacos El Gordo, Tacos Mexico...the list goes on and on. Definitely my favorite taco shop.","Use to be a roberto's, but now they ae much cleaner and the food seems to be much better.  Friendly people and fast service.","I have only had the Breakfast Burrito. It was below average. it had very little taste was greasy and the potatoes they put in it were almost mashed. I will give them another shot cause they are close to my house but with so many options in the area I don't think they will make they cut.","Anything with El Pastor (super flavorful pork) is crazy good here! Open 24 hours is a major plus! Service is great even at 3am. I do find my self adding salt to anything with asada here","Love this place. Like a Roberto's, but a bit more personable (and it's close to my house). They'll make a costumized breakfast burrito and I can call it in. It'd get 5 stars if they had fresh brewed iced tea...","Really good taco shop for Las Vegas standards (obviously not as good as a San Diego taco shop).  Open 24 hours.\n\nI had a quesadilla and 5 rolled tacos.  Food was cooked up really really quick.  Tables inside are clean.\n\nThe quesadilla was very cheesy and very buttery.  Delicious.  Tortilla was a tad bit rubbery, but not nearly as bad as most taco shops around town.\n\nThe rolled tacos were great.  A bit big too.  They were crispy without being overcooked.  Guacamole was slightly above average.","Horrible food! They reheat their meats by adding oil. The guy at the counter never said hello, thank you or smiled once. After we sat down the guy at the counter and one of the guys in the back started wrestling around on the floor. A la lucha libre. The salsa bar was nasty and dirty.\nSuper burrito is so much better.","Like Roberto's, but better food!  Best chile relleno I've had since L.A. 20 years ago.  They get horchata right too:  Not too watery.  It might seem silly, but more than half the time I've been to Roberto's the horchata is too watered down.   Great hot sauces at the sauce and vegetable bar.  Beef burritos have lots of onions and green pepper --  I like them that way, but if you don't,  then you'll probably want them to hold the peppers and/or onions.  Counter s staff are always friendly and helpful, unlike Roberto's.  There's a reason every time I come in here there's always locals ordering.  They do a taco shop the way it ought to be done!","I was craving some mexican food the other day & went to Roberto's which is now called Laurita's. I go inside and it smells spicy! Yum! Order up a chimichanga plate with an extra side of rice. Got it home and it was HUGE. It seriously took me 3 days to eat this thing.\nI dont usually eat much ethnic food but I have to say this was not bad..it was not the best I ever ate but is sure beats Taco Bell. LOL","I don't think it's the same as Roberto's. Sure it's Mexican food but, it's way better food. Way cooler people. I feel like I get attitudes when I go to Roberto's. But at Lauritas it feels more friendly and like a family owed spot\" kinda like\" a bodega in new York. Oh I miss those. But yea I drive way farther to go to Lauritas n I got a Roberto s right down the street. \nThanks for all the good eating and friendly service Lauritas.","Went today and had a bean and cheese burrito. It was really good. Better than Fausto's and Roberto's. Plus the place smelled and looked clean. Can't wait to go back to try the huevos rancheros and flautas!","One step above Taco Bell and Del Taco, but not a sit down style restaurant. When looking for cheap, greasy eats at 2am in the morning, this joint hits the spots. I am not sure what the difference is between Laurita's and Roberto's, because it all taste the same and I do not mean that in a bad way. \n\nThe rolled tacos smothered in guacamole never fails to satisfy and for five dollars, it is affordable. Add another dollar to make it a combo with a drink. The salsas do not have a distinct flavor, but the pickled vegetables are delicious.","Best food in town.. like really. And no.. the phone # they have up there is INCORRECT.. ITS (702) 270-4116.","Why dont the hundreds of happy customers ever write in. This is the spot. Ten pm Sunday night. Music is playing guys in the back chopping up all the fixings all fresh. My California burrito is hot fresh n delicious.  There's never a bad burrito from this place.  I don't understand the negative reviews. What do these people want from a neighborhood taco shop with great food n nice people.  I love this place n hope everyone that works there is as happy as me when I get my favorite food at great prices. Just go give them a try. Get the California. N be nice when you go in n maybe it will be a better experience for you.   \n\nI think I miss read one lol.  Anyway this place rocks!!!","After pondering whether to go to Roberto's or try out Laurita's my wife and I finally landed on trying a new hole in the wall. We were very happy with the results. \n\nIf you've read my Mexican Food reviews in the past you will know that the key to my heart is through a bean & cheese burrito. Something so simple can often times go so bad. It's a travesty really. I wasn't sure what to expect from Laurita's. The establishment itself used to be a Roberto's and still sports some of the old Roberto's attire. Fortunately, their bean burrito isn't anything like Roberto's. \n\nThey have numerous specials at ridonkulously cheap prices. A coke, bean & cheese burrito, and a churro for the mere price of $3.99. Holy guacamole is that cheap! The beans are very good, the burritto could have used some extra cheese (since I did pay for extra cheese). The beans were piping hot and the burrito was massive. I could barely finish it. Top it off with a churro that was just a notch below a Disneyland churro and now we're talking a good meal. My wife had the wet bean & cheese burrito. She definitely liked it, personally I didn't care for the enchilada sauce (I prefer more of the cherry red colored sauce, this one was a little darker - but not bad according to her). \n\nThe service was surprisingly good. Can't say I've had too much good service at Taco Shops, but the gentleman running the register, filling drinks, and providing refills was exceptionally friendly. Much appreciated! \n\nI'll definitely be back to burrito it up at Laurita's."],"business_id":"PmeN_flCu1DonjP_g90sFw","name":"Laurita's Taco Shop","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Definitely a hidden gem of Mexican restaurants! My wife and I are picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants, and this city has enough bad ones to overwhelm anyone. We used to live pretty close to Sunset Station, and decided to try this place after a movie. We had pretty low expectations and we were quickly blown away. First, its easy to fill yourself up on the complimentary chips and salsa bar. There are at least 10 different salsas plus bean dip and mole for you to enjoy. All the salsas are freshly made and each has a distinct flavor. Second, the prices on the entrees are really unbeatable for nicer casual Mexican places. Third, the food portions are huge! Considering the free chips and salsa, its really easy to get two meals out of one entree. Fourth, the  food quality is great! Everything tastes fresh and is very flavorful, which is definitely contrary to the many bland dishes you can find at other restaurants. Finally, we've been several times (at least a dozen) over the past 2 years, and we have always had great service. \nWe aren't fans of many of the restaurants in Station Casinos, but this one is definitely worth it. \nWe are vegetarians, and the staff at Guadalajara is very willing to accommodate our requests.","This place is not one of my favorites but we were at Sunset Station and decided to go.  First off, I love that they have a salsa bar!  They have tons of different salsas and I always head there before I even sit down.  I just break off from the hostess and always have to find my way to our table with chips and salsa in hand.  The past two times I have gone, I got back to the table and there were chips and salsa waiting.  Why have a salsa bar AND bring chips to the table?  If you find out, let me know.  My big problem with this place is the chicken.  I'm not sure if they boil it or what but any chicken dish I have eaten here is dry and not too tasty.  They do fine cheese enchiladas but I think chicken at a Mexican restaurant should be top notch and at this place, it just isn't.  I don't have incredibly high standards for Mexican food and this place is alright.  Salsa Bar, Yes!  Chicken, No!","went again last night!!!! DEEELISH!!! Had the we luv locals coupon for $60 worth of food for $30 HOW does one beat that!!! we had 4 margartias , tableside guac,bacon wrapped shrimp (bf had these and said they were VERY VERY good!) grilled fish tacos and he had 3 combo platter...total $44 !!! woohoo!!! We could have just had 2 margarita and it would have been just about exactly $30 but why not go for the GOLD!!!","Okay, yes, a decent salsa bar, but everything else was sub-par. First of all, we waited FOREVER for everything and it was so not a peak time or that busy. And the food; ohh boy. Maybe I misread the menu, but where I'm from carne asada enchiladas doesn't mean premade cheese enchiladas with a few overcooked strips of steak on top. It came with a small portion of beans and rice that I gobbled down quickly. The meal followed a super boring, hardly edible salad that I took two bites of and pushed aside. The house dressing was of a watery tomatoey variety. But yeah, the enchiladas were pretty tasteless, especially for $14.99. \n\nMy boyfriend was appalled that his taco shells were soggy and there was like 4 pieces of shredded cheese atop sad pieces of chicken. He commented that we could have made much better tacos at home. Never again. \n\nThe other Mexican restaurant in this casino, the counter service one, is actually good, just a tip! Go there!","First time here.  The salsa bar was great.  Huge variety of salsa.  Service was good little slow at times.   But we got what we ordered. I had the three combo.shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada and Chili relleno.  Taco was awesome but next time I will try the ground beef. The shredded was big chunks so it got messy.  The enchilada was excellent. The relleno was a bit too greasy for my taste.   All in all it was a great meal presentation was lacking but the door was good.","Tasty generous portions, four of us all well pleased with different entrees and my spinach fajitas as pictured. A birthday person in our group enjoyed the serenade of the entire staff complete with a sombrero!","I came to Cabo for a birthday dinner and this place is great!  The salsa bar is AHHH-mazing because Cabo provides different sweet, mild, and spicy sauces.  Some examples include tomatillo avocado, pico de gallo, a sweet and spicy fruit salsa, and these hot salsas that I can't remember the names of.  They also have a refried bean sauce that helps neutralize the spices in your mouth.  I also like the fact that Cabo has a self-serve chips area so that customers don't have to ask the workers, \"Can we get more chips?\"  The carne asada burrito was definitely flavorful because the steak was marinated well and the corona-rita was smooth and buzzing.  If you come here on someone's special day, they sing and give a very large sombrero.  I'm definitely a fan and I will be back in the future!  If you enjoy Mexican food, this is the place to be!","I'm a big fan of this place, its pretty delicious. We've been here 3 times total and since its changed to Cabo, its even better than it was (don't know how that works, but okay...) I enjoy Sunset, so having a go-to restaurant that allows me to grab a meal and then go out and gamble is a fantastic convenience. Its in a quieter part of the casino too, and the restaurant is big enough where you forget where you are. \n\nIts a great place for a casual meal- the endless chips with their different salsa combinations and the margaritas just scream relaxing after a hard day at work. There's always people walking around, checking if you need service. One time we came here and a lady went to the salsa bar for us each time we wanted something. They're super attentive! \nThe margaritas are the best. I can actually be highly allergic to alcohol, and here they make the drink for me just right. The black beans are amaazzziiiing! And the prices are reasonable. \nDefinitely try this place if you haven't.","Very pretty inside!  Great prices!  The service was a little slow, but the food was great!  The tortilla soup was my fav!  The chicken fajitas are only $8.99 with your players boarding pass!  They also have a nice sized salsa bar with a great selection of salsas, from mild to extra hot!  You really cant beat it with the price and taste of food!","OMG!!!! BEST . GUACAMOLE. EVER!!!!! Table side guac is the best i've ever ever had here...only problem is they are not consistent :( first time i had it INCREDIBLE, second time i went for it they were out of avocados ???  A Mexican restaurant out of avocados?? third time it was ehh and the last time a few days ago FANTASTIC!!!! The fish tacos are TO DIE FOR as well!!!! Highly recommended !!! LOVE this place ! and the $6 house margaritas cant be beat!!!","Love the tacos and salsa bar- also have great bean dip and chips! Not super original but classic American Mexican food!","Went there last night in hopes of finding some decent Mexican Food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. First of all, the service was lacking. It took us asking twice to just get a container of salt to the table. Also, the waitress was less than interested in helping us with anything more than taking our order. \n\nSecond, the food was atrocious. You know you have an issue if you need to add salt to Mexican food. The rice was dry (almost hard and old) and completely tasteless. The beans were bland and tasted like paste. There was barely any cheese in the enchilada I had. My husband's tacos wee haphazardly put together, falling over and impossible to pick up, and needless to say did not taste good. \n\nThe only saving grace was the shredded beef burrito and the Tomatillo-Avocado salsa. No, I will not be going back, even with the Yelp offer.","I wish this place was open for lunch, but it's not.....The best thing here (the only thing we order) is the table side guacamole. It's great! The rest if the food on the menu is basic \"safe\" watered down Mexican food....seems to make tourist, wonderbread middle America happy. \n\nOrder the guacamole! YUM!  :o)","Food was good. Service was slow. Did not receive my appetizer and took 20 minutes for my free dessert with the Yelp coupon.","I went to dinner with my family and we got seated right away. The server was very nice and checked on us a lot. The salsa bar was amazing, the salsa range from mild to super spicy. There was also a nice bean dip. \n\nWe had to cadillac margarita and a mojito. The margarita came with a shaker that you could take home. The entries were delicious.","Probably the most under-rated Mexican restaurant in Vegas - at least for the sort of thing I want to eat.\n\nTwo people can easily dine for under $25 and the complimentary salsa bar is amazing.\n\nI order a grilled chicken nachos which is ENORMOUS (I can barely finish 1/3 of it if I am lucky  - the rest comes home to be grazed upon for a day or two) for $6.99.\n\nPleasant Decor, tasty food, MASSIVE servings and rock bottom prices. I can't ask for much more.","What a delightful meal! Cabo is nestled into a quiet corner of Sunset Station Casino, and is furnished with beautiful and rustic Mexican decor. The menu has enough to satisfy any palate searching for a good Mexican dinner, but not so much as to overwhelm you. \n\nOur server was Daniel, and he was delightful. He was attentive, funny, knowledgable, and helpful. Truthfully, he is the main component of what made our dining experience so memorable.\n\nI couldn't decide between the chicken tamales and the chicken enchilada, so Daniel suggested I get the combo platter as to enjoy both! I did prefer the enchilada to the tamale, but both were great, filled with shredded chicken and topped with a mild green sauce. \n\nThe manager, Mike, even stopped by our table to insure we were having a good dining experience. I was so very impressed with service. \n\nI would definitely suggest Cabo. Go in and ask to be seated with Daniel!","Guacamole tableside ... perfect!  Salsa bar ... loved the habenero salsa (if you like it hot, try it)!!  Had a drink and a couple appetizers (the quesadillas were great).  Will be back to try more items.  Pleasantly surprised by the good service, decent ambiance, good prices and great food ... and as you know, good mexican food in Vegas is hard to come by.","We've been coming here since it was Guadalajara. Granted, the food here isn't going to change the world. My husband and I are vegetarian, and we pretty much order the same thing - the Spinach Enchiladas - and they are always tasty. What sets this apart for us is the service. The wait staff nearly always recognizes us, as does the hostess who is usually there. One of our waiters even remembered our order after we hadn't been there for a couple of months (travelling over the summer). That kind of friendly atmosphere is a rare find, especially in a busy casino restaurant, and that goes a long way with me!","I've heard of this place but had never tried it until now. I had a hankering for some Mexican food and a friend recommended this place, so I bit.\n\nThere was a 15 minute wait and I haven't an issue with that. It just means it's a popular spot and I'm in for some good Mexican food! We were sat and informed that there was a self service chips and salsa bar. I found this to be pretty awesome. You can grab your own chips and pick what types of salsa you want to try. This made me an instant fan. What didn't make me a fan was that there weren't any napkins at the station nor at our table. Not certain if they are aware of this, but chips and salsa can get a little messy.\n\nI ordered a taco salad minus the meat due to being vegetarian. It actually wasn't that bad but I will admit that I've had better. Nothing really wowed me about it and nothing really said authentic Mexican food to me. I could have gotten a better taco salad at Roberto's or an equivelant at Qdoba. \n\nOverall, the waitress was very friendly and always checked on us. And the hostess even hunted us down at the nearby bar when it was time for us to be seated, so kudos on the service. As far as the food is concerned? It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. Nothing really said come back for more.","Margaritas too sweet - too much mix. Salsa fresco and tomatillo avocado salsa are good. Chicken suiza and chimi were good especially the green chile verde sauce!","Only 3 stars?  Apparently no one has been to Cabo. The food is good. The service is good. The prices are reasonable. Portions are generous.  The drinks aren't watered down. \n\nA BIG PLUS is that you can get a great vegetarian meal. So hard to find!  We will be repeat customers!","I had a $25 food voucher and that's enough for 2.  The chips and salsa bar really give great value but getting carried away with a lot of it will guarantee boxed leftovers.  We ended up with a couple of boxes!\n\nWe ordered the steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas.  The food was pretty average.  The cut of beef they used for the fajitas was kinda weird, almost overly tender and would've been better for beef stew.  Enchiladas were what would we expected them to be.  It's hard to mess those up.  \n\nOur server was very upbeat and friendly.  This place is more like 2.783346 stars and I'm pretty sure it'll be my last time there with so many other choices for Mexican food around.","Sometimes you just don't want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out. Cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions. Last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that we've become accustomed to. Our server, Daniel flat knows how to move things along and once again he took great care of us. I didn't have to ask for refills on my drink, and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before I even started to get up to head to the salsa bar for more. It's the little things. They make a huge difference. And with a 2 year old along when making the tableside guacamole he didn't just assume what ingredients should be left out. He asked. That was appreciated. \n\nIn short, another solid 4 star experience. It's not 5 stars, but sometimes you don't want 5 stars, you want consistent 4 star, rock solid food and a hassle free experience. Cabo delivers that for us. \n\nOne tip: On the AYCE tacos, be aware of the restrictions. No sharing, no doggie bags, batteries not included. Oops, scratch the last one. Still we ordered the non AYCE tacos. Only was able to eat 2 anyway. Just thought I'd share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy. In that case order away. It just means I have time to get to the salsa bar before you do! \n\nOne last thing: The mobile app should show more check-ins, not sure what is up with that.","OK Mex,but not just feels cheap.\n\nNot open for lunch and the waitstaff would rather be doing something else.\n\nWhy cheap you say?\n\nI went there a year ago and sat at the bar and noticed a very loud fan in the beverage cooler (like 70 or 80 db loud).\nWent back 2 months later.Still broke. \nAnd 3 months later,nope,still broke.\n\nLast time I was there,it was finally fixed,but this is a sit sown restaurant in a very large casino and you can't get that fixed for nearly a year?\n\nMan ,talk about cheap!","on our date night we figured last time we came to early so now its time for mexican! I had a diners coupon that was sent in the mail for 10$ off so it was really a no brainer :) i recalled they had an awesome salsa bar and i was right. I love sweet salsas and they had two to choose from a pineapple salsa and a mix of different fruits. but my fave was the avocado salsa and the regular chunky. \n for my meal i opted for the appetizer beach platter. it had a lil of everything chicken wings with ranch, steak nachos, chicken taquitos, and a plain cheese quesadilla. oh yes i cant forget the awesome cup of queso they also give you!!!!  If you ask me the cheese quesadilla was a throw away nothing very special about it, it was bland except if you dip it in the queso. I would love to have had more chicken wings or taquitos. \nmy fiance was thinking cheese so he ordered the cheese enchiladas, he is a manly man and sorry to say this was a puny meal for him. i of course shared mine :) Last time we were at cabo he ordered the shrimp tacos which he loved and he actually talks about from time to time so im sure he will go back to that next time around. \n\nour waitress was very pleasant and we will definatly be back for another trip to cabo.","I love Mexican food and this is Not Spectacular just OK ..........pretty Americanized but the food has decent flavors! They do have good prices and good salsa bar!","Terrible service ! As a matter of fact it looked like our server went out of their way to ignore us. When we finally did get some food it was only average. The only good thing is the Salsa Bar. However, the little containers are so small you can't dip your chips into them without breaking the chips. We'll never go back ! I'd rather eat at Taco Bell. The rest of our experience at Sunset Station was excellent. Just stay away from Guadalajara's.","Friday night dinner with my Husband and Son.  We were seated right away. I had the combo plate with a cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. I substituted more rice for the beans. I also had a regular frozen margarita. Everything was very good and tasted fresh. We had pretty good service. I asked for a side of guacamole which was forgotten twice but I finally got it. All in all we had a very good experience.","SALSA BAR.\nSeriously. \nSmells like old cigs inside (since it's in a casino),  food is alright (plentiful and salty) margaritas are weak as hell, but !! The open salsa bar with 10 distinct flavors: very wonderful.","This review is for the Mexican Restaurant.  It's pretty good.  The salsa bar is great.  Big portions.  I would give it 4 stars but the decor is old","Carne asada burrito was ok. Salsa bar was good!","The Verde sauce was delicious! !! The chicken enchiladas and chicken tamales were really tasty and the margaritas were on point!","Although the food was decent, our waiter was terrible. We are seated for a few moments before the waiter approaches to take our drink order. He returns with place settings. Few minutes later comes with our drinks and says the chips are on their way. Must have been coming right from the border because we waited about 10 minutes before we were delivered what was the bottom of the barrel crumbs. I ordered the enchilada and chimi taquito combo both with chicken, with rice and refried beans and my friend ordered the chimi taquito and mini burrito, both with chicken, with black beans and rice. The meal was pretty good, not the best I've had in town, but ok. However our waiter disappeared. We had to ask the busser Cody for a refill on our Pepsi!! He was the best part of our experience!!! When our waiter finally showed up he stood about 4 feet away from us like we were contagious! Well perhaps maybe he was afraid to catch a personality!!!!\nI am sure I will eat here again but hope next time the service is better! \nOh and if you are wondering, they were not busy. It was about 9:30 in the evening and hardly anyone there. The previous time we were there all the tables were filled and our server that time was on too of it!! \nThey should make Cody a server. He was hustling out there!!!","Every week I have an administrative staff meeting. My turn to pick the location and this one was my fault. Service was OK at first but our server soon lost interest in our table. The food was bland resembling microwave frozen food. No one was impressed. Still looking for a good Mexican place in the Vegas valley","OK first off i love Mexican food. \ni have been here many times. the food is very good and the service is great. i usually have the burrito but this last time i had the steak quesadilla. very satisfying. the waitress was exceptional. the only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is that the bowls at the salsa bar are so god damn small...they are so small you cant get a whole chip in them. I'm a huge fan of chips and salsa so id like a bowl bigger than thimble. \nother than that id go again and again","Met a friend for Dinner and it was an ok experience. The positive is the hostess came to us at the bar across the way to let us know our table was ready. Our waitress was pretty attentive. The only draw back on service was that it took them awhile to bring us some silverware. We ordered and as we were waiting we hit the chip and salsa bar. There was no chips but crumbs. We had to wait for that. The salsa bar was pretty messy. After going up a second time you would hope they cleaned it up. No, it was still messy. The salsa was pretty good. A good selection to choose from from very mild to hot. Well, what they think is hot lol. More like spicy ketchup. The menu was ok. Very pricy for the types of selections to choose from. I just ordered from the appetizers because it just seemed tastier. I ordered the Cholula Boneless Wings. They were pretty good. The flavor was cholula blended with butter. It was a star. The spicy chicken flour taquito thing they had, I don't know the name but was made with flour and looked more like an egg roll. It was flavorless. Im dipping salsa and cholula on it to get some sort of flavor. The other thing i couldn't figure out is that it's owned by station casinos, why is beer pricier in the restaurant when the bar next the it was cheaper. It made no sense and we would have to walk out to save a buck. Hopefully fix some things and revamp the menu. I don't know if i would go back unless I hear some positives. Till next time...Let's Eat!!","This was one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  The chips were super cheap and salty.  I ordered chicken tamales which were so dry I could hardly swallow them.  Vegas doesn't have very good Mexican restaurants to begin with, but this was pretty bad.  The service was not very good for a Mexican restaurant, usually they are super fast and efficient.  I will definitely never come here again!","We just had dinner at this place tonight. I read the reviews so I wanted to ck it out for myself since I live so close to Sunset Station. The restaurant has a feel to it, like its a real mex. rest.. not like its inside a casino. Indeed very romantic old school hacienda feel. I loved the ambiance.\n\nFOOD:  I ordered pork tamales came in the husk with the red chile sauce and topped with Oaxacan cheese. ..which were good but a few bites in there were a smidge dry. It came with refried beans (or blk if u choose) and mex. rice. But.. I'd rather have dry than super greasy any day! ($9.99) My bf ordered the Carne Asada Platter $13.99 that came with beans/rice and  huge salad. I thought wow, nxt time I come I'm going to try their ckn tortilla soup and be good with that. They have a huge salsa bar which was really really good. They had avacado tomatillo salsa that was out of this world. I'd GO BACK just for that! omg. so good. No my bf won tonight b/c the carne asada was like butta it was soo smootha nd delicious. great flavor and not @ all fatty like I pictured it. It's kinda hard to get good carne asada out here. usually its pretty chewy, but this this place. They had really good food. I was so full I ended up taking most of this home. \n\nDRINKS: \nMy bf ordered a regular house marg. $3.95 and I told the waiter I want a real marg. not the slushy pancake molasses aunt jamima marg. I want one that contains actual tequila! He brought me a cadillac margarita and it was gooooood I'd have ordered too but that one was $8.95 and I still had a lot of good food to try so I kept it to a min. of 1 for the night. \n\nSERVICE:\nThis is a great place and I think I will add it to the rotation. Oh and the waiter we had was great. His name was Dan, he was super cool and so was our water guy. I didnt catch his name but he recommended the flan nxt time we go or the sopapillas. I'm still too full to even think about that and I ate there hours ago.  A def. must try on the list for Henderson residents.","A big, comfortable place which has a great decor. The food is great, good price and server fast. They even have a salsa bar so you don't have to wait to get more chips and salsa. Works well for a couple or 20.","Cabo offers attentive SERVICE with a smile and not just by one server but by everyone who we come in contact with. The salsa bar is a very good value, the chips are hot and fresh and there's pretty much a salsa for all tastes. The $7.99 taco deal is good but I really like the cheese enchiladas as unlike elsewhere in Vegas they actually taste really good. The margaritas are good, we had a mixologist with us who threw a challenge at the bar and they made her specified drinks for all of us perfectly. \n\nIf you look at my reviews I always find a negative to toss in. Cabo is an exception, I have nothing but positive praise for this place. Also my 2 year old can give a review of the tableside guacamole. He left the bowl it came in, but not much else.","Very decent place.  The food is freshly prepared/made to order.  Their menu is small but so are most places that have a similar feel to it.  The good and bad are that it is located in Sunset Station.  Bad because it is in the Casino good, because it is in the Casino.  I say this because some people will never enter a casino and those who do come here have a great alternative to some of the bigger restaurants to use their comp dollars and to find good inexpensive food.","Best Mexican food I've found in this town so far. Great chips and salsa bar. Bean dip was good. Had the appetizer sampler. Everything was good. Just wish it was open for lunch.","Finally!!  A decent Mexican restaurant!  We have been searching for a place that had flavor and spiciness.  We have found it.  \n\nBefore you order a big plate of food, there is a Salsa Bar that has 8 different salsas!  They range from a few milds up to the hot hot salsa (which is for my husband!) On the salsa bar is also bean dip.  We were so delighted with this!  \n\nSince it was our first time here, we only started with an appetizer not knowing if we would still be hungry for a meal.  We ordered the Beach Party Platter which included quesadillas, steak nachos, wings, chicken taquitos and chili con queso.   This was absolutely filling and delicious! After all of this food, we couldn't possibly order a meal.  \n\nBonus~ Their strawberry margaritas are big and only $6! Sweet and Strong! \n\ni only wish they were open for lunch.  Their hours are 5-11.  I would have given 5 stars.  Maybe I should petition for lunch!  I would definitely recommend going to the Sunset Station Cabo Restaurant.  Even if it's just for the salsa bar, you wont be disappointed!"],"business_id":"Qi2R3JN5Prx69X5r1RXwCA","name":"Cabo Mexican Restaurant","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Yelp, I cannot think of the words necessary to express my disappointment.  This was not only the worst seafood I have eaten in my life, but by far the worst Mexican food as well.  What are you people smoking?\n\nWe started with a few beers, can't screw that one up.  I ordered an appetizer that was completely not as described but I should have known better since it was in the cold section of the appetizers.  It sure didn't say raw oysters, raw shrimp, octopus, and thawed shrimp in a crappy broth.  All for $15?  As if there wasn't enough lack of texture with those ingredients, they throw avocado on top.  Yeah, that will round out the dish.  I am not even completely factoring that into the rating because I should have paid more attention to it being cold.\n\nFor my meal I got Marlin Machaca.  What kind of seafood joint serves you shredded fish?  Is it marlin or Tuna?  Why the hell would I want my fish shredded?  On top of that the flavors were just bad.  It was either canned, or just not fresh.  How can you call this place a seafood establishment when they rape the fish so badly?  It came with refried beans, white rice with frozen peas and carrots, and a pile of raw iceberg lettuce.  Why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice?  It doesn't bring me comfort to know they aren't cooking anything fresh.  And why the nasty white iceberg in clumps?  The beans were good and they gave us tortillas so I spent the meal making little tacos and seeing which hot sauce covered up the poor flavors the best.\n\nThe other victim ordered the \"fish\".  How much less information can they provide.  It was a choice between sea bass or Tilapia.  Since Tilapia is a FRESHWATER fish, they lose points and really expose themselves as a fraud.  Hers was much better than mine, but nothing worthy of  taking it home leftovers or ever returning.  \n \nBill totaled out to $50+!!  For Mexican food, and terrible Mexican food at that!  Food was awful, prices were outrageous, it was in the cesspool that is Guadalupe, how much worse can it get?\n\nI should have listened to my inner voice that said nothing good happens in Guadalupe.  It is an unbelievable little place.  The instant you cross over from Tempe to the Guad the road turns to crap with potholes and bumps everywhere.  Businesses vanish, and homes are replaced with shacks.  Minimal street lights and overall maintenance and infrastructure make you feel like 2012 has already arrived.  The best part of our journey was driving away, seemingly crossing an imaginary line of civilization and being back in Tempe at AZ Mills Mall.\n\nNot sure what the expectations are for the other reviewers, but I expect fresh food from the sea.  Much of what we ate was probably out of a can like the octopus, oysters, and the marlin.  The shrimp were most likely frozen and/or precooked.  \n\nSaturday night, there was one couple eating there, and a bunch of drunks outside playing the guitar.  That says more about this place than the unexplainable positive reviews on here.  I will never be able to look at Yelp reviews the same way again...\n\n... The one positive I take from this experience is that I saw a hot dog cart and a taco cart as I left the Guad.  I may have to hit up the taco cart in the future.\n\n(EDIT: I wonder why the other bad review for this place has been hidden.  I should have weighed his opinion more heavily, would have saved me a bad experience and some cash)","Fab chips and salsa, you can tell it is made fresh. The service is always so friendly. The beers are cheap and served with frozen mugs. \nThere is an amazing thing that happens here...Molcajete. This dish is ridiculous. It is filled with shrimp (you can get mixed seafood too), onions, mushrooms and tomatoes in this beautiful sauce that has just the right amount of spice. It is topped with a handful of cheese and served in a screaming hot lava rock bowl. It arrives at the table bubbling and sizzling. Get it with the super fresh corn tortillas and you have a meal made in heaven. I always share it with someone because it is so much food. \nThe seafood cocktails here are great too! \nCheck out the pics I posted to see what I'm talking about.\n\nDon't come here looking for average Mexican food. There isn't a single burrito to be found. \n\nGo get some!!!!","San Diego Bay Restaurant is as good as its Yelp reviews.\n\nMy son and I are in Scottsdale for our 10th annual three-day Spring training pilgrimage.  After a winning Giants game, and lunch of ballpark fare we need some authentic cuisine, which we found in Guadalupe, AZ.\n\nEat here!","Of course, my boyfriend and I wanted the lava bowl.  Nothing sounded more delicious than fresh-tasting octopus, shrimp, fish, and mussels in a cheesy, creamy sauce.  In a lava bowl.\n\nOur molcajete arrived hot and bubbling, and after a few bites, kicked in with a burn-your-lips-off hot spice that I couldn't love more.  It's more than enough to split, so keep that in mind when looking at the (somewhat-higher-than-typical-Mexican-fare) prices.\n\nTortillas tasted fresh, the guac was solid, and chips were the crispy, oily, delicious kind I adore.  The on-table salsa is kickin' and delicious.  What San Diego Bay lacks in ambiance, they more than make up for with flavor.\n\nAnd really, what more do you want from a Mexican restaurant?  A bucket of Coronas for $12??\n\nSan Diego Bay's got you covered all around.","Thanks YELP! (again)!  I really like this place and would have never found it if it wasn't for YELP!\n\nI've eaten there several times now, both for lunch and dinner, excellent Mexican seafood - very authentic.  Great flavor, great salsa in a (very) casual environment that gives a lot of the local hispanic flavor of Guadalupe!  The music on the jukebox is often traditional Mexican Mariachis and everyone speaks Spanish - a great meal and great bargain!","Hubby and I finally made it here last night. The area is definitely a little shady and the restaurant itself is surely nothing special to look at. We walked in and nobody was there. No biggie; I was trusting fellow Yelpers that it was good. The lady that waited on us was super duper nice. The chips weren't the freshest, but the salsa was awesome. It had a nice heat, which we love. We each ordered a crab tostada, and you could definitely tell it wasn't the fake stuff. It tasted good, until about halfway in I started getting too much lime flavor (which I don't care for) so I let hubby have the rest. He gobbled em up and loved every bit. Next came our molcajete. We obviously had to order them due to the rave reviews. I loved the presentation. Hubby got the mixed seafood one, which was shrimp, octopus, and snail. I opted for just shrimp. The tortillas it comes with are fresh and warm and delicious. The soup is spicy and flavorful and pretty damn good. I did, however, get a few shrimp that tasted a little funny. I don't think they were rotten seeing as I'm not sick, but just tasted a little off. The tomato broth did kinda make me \"gaggy\" toward the end but overall it was tasty. We had a restaurant.com certificate, and the total bill + tax came to $50 or so, but we only ended up paying $27. Hooray for discounts! :)","Multiple visits through the years reaffirm my love for this place!  The pregnant tostadas are the best with real crab vs the other tostadas, accompanied by lovely scallops and shrimp.  As other say, the shrimp molcajete is very tasty, and also props to their goburnador tacos.  Avoid the stuffed filet preparations however.  \n\nOverall, still extremely worth braving the sheriff's posse in Guadalupe to get some exceptionally good food!","First off, the location of this place isn't helping it at all.  It's tucked away behind a huge ugly walled in area, and you can't see it from the street at all.  This isn't a luxurious meal by any means, and when we walked in we took note of all the un-bussed tables filled with dirty plates, etc.  However, we sat down to eat nonetheless.  \n\nThe server (who was also the cashier and busser on this day) was very polite and friendly.  He promptly brought over chips and salsa, which were very good.  The food we ordered was good - my wife had fish tacos, I had calamari.  Both portion sizes were large.  Mine came with beans, salad, rice and tortillas.  Our bill was less than $25, so no complaints on the prices either.  This place would probably flourish in a different location, and with more staff.","Went for an early dinner on a Sunday and we were very pleased! The salsa is great, but I do prefer a thinner chip. Started with a dozen oysters on the half shell. My boyfriend and I are big oyster fans, these were fresh, plump and delicious! Then we had the shrimp and avocado salad, very fresh. The Molcajete was amazing, great flavors, hard to describe, a must try. I ordered the Whole Red Snapper Fried, served with rice, beans, and salad. The rice could use some work, the only negative really of the whole meal. I enjoyed the beans. Overall, I would go back again, I tend to like places that are \"hidden gems\", this being one. Also alcohol is very reasonable.","I'm not crazy about seafood.  Maybe because I've never had it serve so well.  I was a little put off when we went into San Diego Bay and, having read the menu cover to cover, finding no no chicken or beef plates.  I decided I would suck it up and have a shrimp dish.  Of all the creatures of sea, shrimp are probably the least offensive to me.  I ordered the shrimp molcajete, based mostly on the menu picture.  I looked like a basic stew.  When came to the table was a surprise.  The molcajete, which is a bowl carved from stone, had been heated in the oven and the stew poured into that.  The stew was still bubbling vigorously when it arrived at the table.  The dish was shrimp, of course, served in a stew of tomato, cheese, chiles, and spices.  The base may have been like a shrimp bisque, but I couldn't really tell.  It was fantastic.  I told the waitress it was the best thing I'd had in a long time.  My mom had a similar shrimp stew.  It was substantially more cheesy than mine, and with less fire, but very good as well.  Other items I noted on the menu: marlin tacos, octopus, whole red snapper.","Visited with a group of people from work for lunch, and it was fantastic. I had the Shrimp Verde, and it was quite tasty. Several people had the hot, lava bowl and absolutely loved it. I have no idea what the proper name is, but seriously, could it be cooler than \"I would like to eat the hot lava bowl?\" No, it could not.\n\nI was a little surprised at the prices, which were more than I usually pay for lunch, but it is because of the fresh, great seafood. It came out to about $20 for each of us for lunch, but well worth it.","You can't  live in Arizona and not go there. I stop by every time I visit PHX. Definitely the best seafood in the desert.  Oysters are excellent so as the shrimp in green sauce. The fried whole red snapper is not my thing but next time I will try it steamed.","I'm tellin ya. This is the best seafood mexican in phoenix . Grab a chilada and some seafood molcajete in the Vesuvius lava bowl. The fish and shrimp tacos are super, the margaritas are big and bold. Gets busy, and the location is away in a corner, but well worth it. This place is on my where to eat in Phoenix listing...","This place is being re invented... The place has a new look and every  dish I've tried is amazing, it specializes in seafood Mexican style.... The staff is friendly and the place is clean, and newly remodeled looks great with its new Frida Kaloh  color palet...I hear the menu is going to add some new Latin flavor dishes keep your eyes on this place I feel it's going to be the new spot for many old and new comers!!","In an out of the way for some, but perfectly convenient to our hotel location, San Diego is a great little spot for some Mexican seafood in Guadalupe. I kicked off the meal with one of the best micheladas I've had in a WHILE. It was tart, spicy, good balance of Clamato and beer...so refreshing. The salt around the rim is fancier than my usual version in a plastic cup.\n\nThe specialty here is seafood, and that's what we stuck to.  The molcajete can be ordered mixto instead of just plain shrimp, so we got it that way. The flavor was very good, and there was plenty of seafood: shrimp, calamares, caracol, etc.  It could have used a bit more cheese.  We also had the cold San Diego Cocktail, with many of the same creatures, but in a citrusy broth, an the addition of oysters and avocado. Those two items were more than enough for the two of us, especially with some corn tortillas on the side. \n\nThe decor is bright and friendly with some Diego Rivera prints and tile pieces. The waitress was friendly and attentive, even while handling the whole dining room herself, including a party of 8 or so.","The seafood Molcajate was very good, although, not as cheesy as I expected and I was a bit bummed out when I had to order rice and beans even though it said it came with them.","One wouldn't expect good Mexican-style seafood in the middle of Arizona, much less in the middle of a mostly abandoned strip mall in Guadalupe. But man, oh man. I've never had a bad meal here. The chips and salsa as delicious and the entrees are all so tasty. I have to admit that I usually get the Shrimp Al Ajillo (a chile/garlic sauce) which is just so flavorful. But I do encourage my boyfriend to get other things to try (i.e. for me to try!) and we have never been disappointed. Also, very reasonably priced!","OMG this was good, crab tostada were to die for. I would have never discovered this place it it weren't for yelp. Next time we are in the area we will be back!","I went and had the molcajete (lava bowl). It was a variety of seafood in an enchilada and cheese sauce served with two tortillas. It was enough for two people but it should have come with 4 tortillas, we had to pay extra for the other 2. It would have been better to come with fajita type sides (tomatoes, avocado, onions) (ordering a side of pico de gallo is $3.50 so we skipped it but it would have made it much better) to make it more flavorful and tasty. Just the seafood and tortillas left us wanting more. the tortillas were large but the plates that came with were the size of a saucer for some reason. Very strange. They have specials on Tues for $2 ceviche and $2 margaritas. The area is very sketchy but quiet.","great fresh mexican seafood.  i had the ceviche tostada as an appetizer.  i got two, but one would probably be good.  the main was the shrimp al diablo.  everthing fresh and tasty.   the servers were very nice and helped me practice my spanish.","The shrimp ceviche is fantastic and it was a delight to taste homemade red & green chile sauces on the enchiladas. I've never been to a mainly seafood Mexican restaurant before, so it's hard to compare to others, but I've had the typical seafood dishes at Mexican chains (Arribas, Macayos, etc.) and this is way better. Atmosphere has authentic charm, but the bathrooms could use improvement. Unfortunately during my first visit, they mixed up a sauce request and forgot to bring out a burrito for my son.  We had more than enough food so it wasn't a concern. The price is decent - $45 for a family of four. Overall, I would come back if craving fresh seafood. I would recommend giving the place a try!","My husband was eating here, I swear, at least 1x a week with this soccer buddies.. he'd always come home and tell me about the awesome ceviche, tacos de marlin, and tacos de governador, and mojarra frita he had there.\n\nSo we all went with the in-laws in tow to have lunch there one Sat afternoon.  I had the tacos de marlin and everyone else ordered the vast list of things my hubby recommended.  Let's just say no one at our table was complaining nor disappointed - everyone polished off the food and the ones who couldn't, well, it's only because the mojarra was so huge.  Since I only tried the tacos de marlin and liked them, those are the only ones I can personally say were yummy.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable and the food was plentiful and very, very flavorful.  We did, however, get seated in their back section.. squeezed up against another large family which was a bit annoying since there were 2 huge tables in the main area that said 'reserved' on them (but we noted no one actually ever sat there).\n\nI'd go back again if I got the craving for it... \n\nbtw, it's located in a strip-mall and sorta hard to find if you don't know where to look...","Marlin tacos...wow!  Shrimp diablo was phenomenal.   Great drink specials during the week.","Put the Molcajete on your bucket list. How I ever survived 62 years without ever hearing of let alone ingesting this fabulous dish is beyond comprehension. As close as I can come to describing this dish is that it's a tomato, seafood broth with loads of cheese (which surprisingly does not make for heaviness) that hides about a quarter pound of PD & C tail off shrimp. Great balance on the seasonings. \n\nThe establishment is clean and well lit. The staff very friendly and willingly explained the dishes to their Polish/Gringo guest (moi). If you get the chance to meet Lupita, the owner, do so ... a truly caring restaurateur and a lovely woman. \n\nThis is the type of place that can't be duplicated.","I had read several good reviews on this restaurant so we went along the other night.  \nThe San Diego  Bay restaurant  is located in  Guadalupe,  the Yaqui Native American and Hispanic community right next to Tempe. \nThere was a steady stream of people, but not overly busy.  Restaurant appearance was  clean  and bright.  Don't expect top high flying ambience, just a typical local family restaurant.  Exactly the relaxed style we like.\nThe young lady who served us very helpful, friendly and attentive, She recommended  the ceviche tostada for a starter which was  good and also the  Molcajete de Camaron (shrimp Molcajete) -  a shrimp dish cooked in a very hot  lava bowl with a light spicey cheesy sauce which was excellent - highly recommended.  \nCost was $32 plus tip for a starter, 2 entrees and beer.\nMy wife prefers less spice and went with fish and garlic dish - very nice too. \nExcellent service, great food  - and the  wonderful  Molcajate de Camaron make this a place we'll take our friends to for something different. - highly recommended.","This is one of our absolute favorite places for Mexican food.  We generally take people here from out of town as one of our \"go-to\" places.  I can say the shrimp molcajete is one of my favorite dishes around.  I've yet to see it replicated at another restaurant.  It's a soupy, cheesy, bowl of shrimp goodness.  It comes served in a hot lava bowl that is still bubbly 15 -20 minutes after it's been served.  It is on the spicy side.  My husband and I always share a bowl and use the last of the tortillas to sop of every last drop.  Enjoy!","Visited again after a 5 month hiatus, and happy to report that I re-ordered all their ceviche tostadas and found them all very satisfying.  Small bonus for remembering me and offering what I wanted right away.","Is this place in a sketchy area? Hell Yes!\n\nWould it be good to know Spanish here? Hell Yes!\n\nIs the service good? Hell Yes! (even better when you attempt to speak Spanish, lol!)\n\nIs the food amazing? HELL YES!!\n\nI went here Friday (9/20/13) with my father and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Hands down the best Mexican Seafood in Phoenix (granted there isn't much competition in the Mexican Seafood section).  I started off with a Shrimp Ceviche Tostada and I really could've just eaten three of those and called it a day. The shrimp was perfectly blanched and had just the perfect amount of acidity. The table chips aren't the best but beware the table salsa it has a nice kick to them.  For the entrée I had the Shrimp Diablo and with rice and beans. It was a shame how fast I gobbled down that shrimp. The sauce on the shrimp had a perfect balance of heat and cream. My dad had the Shrimp Veracruz and at first he started to pack left overs but ended up eating the leftovers it was so good! I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu! Another quick note: it is a little pricey especially considering the area, but what fresh seafood in ARIZONA isn't?","I love Mexican Soups, Menudo, Abondigas,tortilla soups, you name it! I found the Mother of all soups especially if you like seafood. Its called the Molcajete de Mariscos. Its a spicy shrimp soup served in a hot lava bowl. The bowl is made of lava stone and they cook it in the oven to heat it up and serve it to you piping hot with your choice of tortillas.","We ate here for the first time a couple weeks ago and it is definitely going into our regular rotation.  This is the only place I have ever found in Phoenix that has true Mexican style seafood dishes.  Their cocktel de camarones was fantastic!  I got shrimp flautas which were also very good.  My husband was pleased that they also had a few non-fish items on the menu and so he ordered the carne asada.  The only negative thing I have to say is DO NOT order the fried banana dessert.  I can't remember what they called it, but it was not good at all.\n\nA couple of caveats (really, responses to the negative reviewers) for those of you considering trying this place: 1 - it is in Guadalupe so there are no frills here, this is a casual mom and pop dive.  2 - it is Mexican style seafood.  Don't order fish and chips and expect it to be good.  That is not what you go here for.","Very pleased with the ceviche section.  Cute lil tostadas with great tasting toppings, some unconventional topping on the special ceviche tostada.  I don't really want to give away its secrets, try it yourself!\n\nLess pleased with the marlin machaca.  Definitely not fresh tasting compared to everything else, but was surprised at how good the rice was, very lightly buttered and salted with some nice snap to the veggies.","I love this Restaurant, I have been going to San Diego bay for years and the food is still great. I was raised in Mexico in the state of Jalisco and this place really reminds me of home. If you are looking for Chimichangas, Burritos, Cheese melted everywhere this place is NOT for you. You are looking for a Tex Mex or chain Restaurant. Every time I have gone to San Diego Bay the food has been very fresh I love their plate of raw oysters, Tostadas de Ceviche, and Campechanas. Oh and Tilapia is very common in Mexico because we have many lakes and we also farm raise it so YES this Restaurant has Tilapia. Also if you are hung over the Michelada is a must have, Beer and Clamato I know it sounds weird but it is so good!! My Fiancée had the Mariscada which is a mixture of Octopus, Oysters, Sea snails, tilapia and shrimp sautéed in yummy garlic goodness with rice. Needless to say he loved it I was not surprised. When I get nostalgic for REAL Mexican this is about as close as you can get in the Valley. Fresh sea food and an ice cold Pacifico  oh yeah!","This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended","Like every mexican joint, you start with chips and salsa.  Their salsa is a unique favor and color.  Not sure what they put in it, but it's delicious.  That's kind of my precursor to what I'm going to order.  \n\nSo the first time I went, I started with the a seafood bowl that was awesome.  The seafood was fresh, and tasted great.\n\nWe also ordered what is known as the Lava Bowl.  Served in a volcano rock bowl that stands tall, the dish was served boiling.  A liquid gold of cheese, mushrooms, onion, shrimp and spices.  Served with fresh, homemade tortillas, this dish is not one to miss.  \n\nBeers served in cold, frosty mugs.  Loving this new place.","Based on the recommendation of fellow yelpers my companion and I made the smart choice and listened.   The staff welcomed us warmly and made us feel at home.   We indulged in a dish that is served in a hot lava bowl......WOW!!!   The cheesy, shrimpy goodness made our first voyage to the San Diego Bay all worth while and worthy of  \"this is a repeat\" status.","I'd agree with Alex, the food is great... the neighborhood not so much.  By far the best Mexican seafood restaurant I've been in north of Rocky Point... it's situated off a Mexican courtyard, in which there is another Mexican restaurant with killer food [although I can't remember the name off-hand]...","Forget the corporate seafood restaurants. Spend an hour or so in Mexico, and eat some amazing food! \r\n\r\nLocated at what ostensibly is the SE corner of Guadalupe and Priest, the San Diego Bay Restaurant is easy to miss...or disregard at first glance.  From the street it looks like just another Guadalupe market.  Then you go around to the lot and try to squeeze in between a BMW and a Mercedes. What do they know that you don't? That the San Diego Bay (named the best authentic Mexican restaurant by the New Times 2005) serves some of the best south of the border seafood around!\r\n\r\nForget ambience...here the food is the star. The whole red snapper, and the grilled seafood assortment are very, very good. But what trips my trigger? The shrimp diablo holds the key to my heart. Shrimp in sour cream, jalepenos, with garlic and onions. Kicks like a mule with velvet horseshoes. Oh so good. My sister orders the version without the heat...called camarones verdes.  \r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor. Take a trip to Guad....and keep those Negra Modelos coming!","Finally tried and great food. Little bit expensive but worth it everything was good . Will go back again.","I've been back 4 times since my initial visit, but today's lunch merits a star reduction, due to the underwhelming special tostada today, which was probably 50% imitation crab meat, instead of the promised variety on their special tostada.  The San Diego tostada was still delicious, but I will begrudge them the krab I reluctantly consumed.","I've had better......\n\nThere was a reason this place was not busy on 7pm on a Friday evening....\n\nFor the price you pay, you get very minimal seafood, and too many fillers. For instance we ordered a plate for 1, the special combination with, snail, octopus, squid. It had tiny pieces of each item mixed in with lots of onions and tomatoes and yellow peppers - this plate was small and cost a whopping $22.00 !!!!!!!!  I could not believe it! Then we ordered a ceviche dish, there was non existent seafood, very little shrimp very little fish, however loaded with tomatoes and fillers.  I Will NOT Be Back!\n\nI have been to many Mexican Cantina Seafood Saloons from Baja Mexico to the best in the Southwest US regions. This place does not even compare. It was a waste money over 50 Dollars spent on veggies with very tiny pieces of seafood. A Total Rip OFF!!! \n\n I do NOT recommend this place, San Diego Bay Restaurant, A waste of Time and Money!!!","Arrived 5:30p, Saturday eve. One couple and one group of buddies were also in attendance -- stayed an hour, no one else came/left. The staff was friendly and accomodating. Magaritas were $5, and tasty. Buddy and I tried: guac on side (delicious, fresh), chips were (nice), salsa (crisp and fresh), Shrimp enchilada ($11) and Swiss Enchilada ($10), served with white rice (blech) and peas/carrots (weird), refried beans w/ monterey jack cheese (nice).\nSpiceeeness is just right for me :)\nTastes all melded well, but not so creative, same old stuff.\nCost: $41 (surprisingly high)...was guac $5? (3 Margs + H2O)\nNext round I'll try the higher end fish products and assess for \"sea\" quality that San Diego is known for...\n\nEnjoy,\nJ","I have eaten in this restaurant for three lunches in a row and brought 3 other people with me in the second trip and 5 other in the third. In short, everybody loved the food and was extremely pleased about our choice to eat here. Nothing really disappointed however the hot bowl of mixed seafood and melted cheese was my personal favorite. When things get complicated , it might be useful to know a bit of Spanish but for the most part that's not needed. Probably left the highest percentage tip I've ever left in our third visit.","I have only had the fish tacos and the ceviche tostadas and they are delish.  I eat here at least once a week and bring the whole family.  Service is always great and their salsa is quite tasty.  I love this place.  I would like to venture out and try the molcajete.  It looks like a lava of cheese.  My food is always great.  My picky kids even love this place.  The fish tacos are my kids favorite.  I think this place is great.  Don't let the fact that it is in Guadalupe scare you!","This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp. San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe.\n\nIt's taken me a long time to review this place. The first time I went was over two years ago and I've been back a few times.  I have to admit, I've never had better Mexican seafood. \n\nUnfortunately since it's been awhile, I've forgotten what I ordered. I can tell you this though, every dish has been superb. Each bite was like heaven. I left wanting to try everything on the menu. \n\nThe servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here, much to their delight. They've all raved about it.","Eat here.  Really nice family running the place.  Shrimp are fresh and tasty.  Best chile relleno i've had in a long time.  I saw a few guys eating shrimp cocktails that looked amazing (cocktail not the dudes); next time I'm getting a cocktail."],"business_id":"QxpX4slDIOGFEHlPV4mrSw","name":"San Diego Bay Restaurant","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["One of my favorite places to eat and can be worked into a healthy diet!","I love this location!! But not only that i am in love with the cliantro lime rice!! I try to copy it but just never turns out like theirs!! Amzing place never have any issues!!","I am a huge fan when it comes to Chipotle. My proportions aside, this place is one of the fastest growing changes in America. I've not had a bad experince here yet. I don't imagine I will have a bad time here, but I'll leave my future options open. This location is particular was pretty darn classy. \n\nHere's a trick I picked up:  Order a burrito bowl (for here or to go doesn't matter) and ask for extra rice. Then ask for 2 tortillas and dump the contents onto your tortilla plates. This makes it easier to mix the goodness around and you can eat the plate! I usually roll it into a burrito when its less-than-exploding-mass is all that's left over.","I am so in love with this place right now. I have the lap band and so I cannot eat like the normal everyday burrito eater. I get the burrito bowl and chips to use to scoop with. I love the atmosphere and the fact that everything is made fresh and you can taste the natural flavors in the food. Amazing. \nIt makes the perfect lunch or dinner...or in my case, BOTH! :)","I've been to this location a lot and absolutely love it. The food is amazing, everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. It is clean and has outdoor seating. I come here at least twice a month. ;)","Amazing food and great service!!","Well. For a place that I visit at least once a week, what higher compliment can I give than spending hard earned money there? Well I could write a great review! I used to be obsessed with Barbacoa tacos, but recently for diet reasons, switched to Barbacoa Burrito Bowl. Yum. This is the closest thing I will get to fast food. AND....they are organic and don't use companies that practice animal cruelty. All in all, its the perfect lunch/dinner place for healthy food.","I love Chipotle's because of this location. I happen to love having a great big, huge burrito filled with fresh ingredients and wonderfully spiced meat right after my workouts at the gym down the road. I had never been to a Chipotle's before I came to this one, and I'm impressed; by the service, the food, the price and the cleanliness. I'm almost a regular here.","It's like a MIX food, Mexican and Asian style except avacado and chips. But I love it sooooooooooooooooooo much especially add avacado (extra charge for it).","Still lovin' this place! Good food, friendly service, very clean, and a great value - for $6 plus change, you can get a HUGE burrito with all the fixin's. I especially love the barbacoa.","Kind of boring I wish there more Qdobas in Vegas","I don't like Burritos but for some reason I love Chipotle's burritos. I always get the same thing: Barbacoa fajita burrito with the cilantro lime rice, black beans, mild salsa and corn salsa. Of course, can't forget the spicy salsa on the side. Yum! For a chain restaurant, it's good, fast and cheap.","Delicious! I am sans gluten most of the time and really enjoyed the bowl option they have at chipotle's. The food was consistent with what I've experienced at other locations (fresh and tasty) and the restroom (ladies at least) was tidy. I'd eat here again if I were in the area.","When they get crowded they skimp on the protein and if they run out of the steak they barely cook it and its bloody. Also they are so busy talking that they forget how to do your order...Three times I said no red salsa and each time you put it on there.  Three stars because its hit or miss.","Gotta love this place!  Love the whole menu, especially enjoy the salad. Load it up with everything on the bar, top it off with a bag of chips and drink for a full meal. I even split the meat, had chicken and steak on my salad this time which made for a good compilation of spicy and zesty!  Can't wait for the next trip back!","I used to like going to this Chipotle, but lately it has gone downhill. There was no line when I arrived, but soon after the dinner rush showed up. I noticed people were waiting a long while and had angry expressions on their faces. \n\nAnother thing, they ran out of chicken. How do you run out of chicken? They were also out of forks. Really???\n\nIt would also be great if they posted the children's menu. It wasn't until I was paying that I saw the take home menus that has choices for kids. Oh well, now I know for next time, but it won't be at this Chipotle.","Wow.  I have been coming to this Chipotle since it opened, and I have to say, back then, only the neighborhood people, the police, and the military knew it was there.  Much better then, not as busy!  But now you walk in there and it's quite crowded.  I don't blame you all, but we don't have that many good places on my side of town so I wouldn't have minded keeping this one quiet!  I agree with Mel C, the parking lot is a little ridiculous.  Not that there aren't enough spaces, but with Five Guys, Subway and Chipotle right there, there really is no sense in trying to park in front.  Just park away and walk.  These burritos aren't low calorie!\n\nThe dining room is very clean and the service is great here.  The food is quite good.  With an open kitchen you can see food preparation, and the food tastes great.  It hasn't been sitting around.\n\nI had this particular Chipotle cater my dad's 60th birthday party and it was a big hit.","I have always been a fan of Chipotle restaurants. That's after I got sick and tired of haHaha Fresh. Some would say that this is not authentic Mexican food but I would have to disagree. Freshness is the key factor for their success. Sure, I like dirty \"C\" rating hole in the wall restaurant but not everyday. The service is fast, efficient and friendly. The establishment is clean and very well maintained. I always get a burrito and I always try to mix it up every time I order just so I can taste the variety. My favorite is t he barbacoa and  carnitas. All the accoutrements are tasty. I rarely get the guacamole because it sky rockets the cost of your burrito and the added $ is not really worth it. Basically, a burrito will set you back $6.50 but that is not bad because you get somewhat of a bang for your buck. I agree with some of the yelpers that they can skimp out on the meat at times and it's a bit disappointing but overall I am very happy with the end product. I am always in the mood for Chipotle.","Great food!!! Simple, fast, and delicious. Love their chicken bowl, white rice, peppers nd onions, corn, lettuce, guac. And thier medium salsa. Delicioso!!!!!!!","Been eating here for 3 years, only order the Steak Bowl, recently the Quality of the steak has become tougher, and I have noticed I constantly have to repeat myself or the orders are totally wrong. If the person filling your order is new the order is going to be screwed up, watch while it's being made or you may get home and find its not your order.","I've never been a huge fan of Chipotle, but you do what you have to do when you're pressed for time, looking for some quick proteins, and don't feel like cooking.  First of all, this parking lot is crazy. There's no sense trying to park close to the restaurant. I suggest parking close to Jamba Juice to avoid the linger drivers and the ones not paying attention. As for the restaurant itself, it's clean and they're busy too. Weekdays during lunch time is usually packed with a line that wraps around. But due to their assembly line process, the line goes fairly quick.\n\nChipotle is known for their stacked burritos, their meats with no hormones, and tasty brown rice. What got me going to Chipotle recently is simple...side chicken and side steak to go.  According to Chipotle, a scoop is 4 ounces in case you measure your food.  I've come here and ordered as much as 10 scoops of this stuff. Yes, that's 40 ounces of chicken or steak.  The employees are cool about it, even though they usually have to cook a new batch just for me. Overall, can't complain about this Chipotle. Their busy, but quick. They're always accommodating too. \n\nTIP:  \n-Ask for heaping scoop of steak or chicken. They usually hook it up for me. Sure doesn't hurt to ask.\n-The chicken or steak isn't totally clean eating. Each 4 oz serving has additional 70 calories and 1 gram of carbs due to the seasoning. I'll usually wash this stuff off the steak and chicken. Yes, I wash the taste away. But I'm also eliminating about 70% of the bad stuff too.\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (413/500)","I feel bad giving a Chipotle one star because in general it is my favorite \"fast\" food restaurant, BUT this particular location is the wooorrrrsstttt!!!!! Easily the slowest service in Las Vegas, possibly of all the Chipotle restaurants I've ever been to. A few of the previous reviews warned not to visit during the weekday lunch hour, but it is always slow any time of day, whether there is a line or not.  Tonight I walked in at 9:15 pm, there were 5 customers in front of me, and I did not walk out with my veggie bowl until 9:30!  All due to slow customer service.  Then they had the nerve to have a tip cup by the register, really?!?  Unfortunately it is the only location any where near my home, so I don't get to have Chipotle as often as I would like.  I still give it a chance every once in a while just hoping one of these times it will be better, still waiting on that day!","Great food! Behind the counter help needs work...Price is reasonable, Ice Tea is good and fresh! We recommend this place to many!","Delicious! The food is always good and fresh. Don't go during normal lunch hours though as it gets crazy busy!","One of my favorite places. Great staff and fast service! Don't come around 12 on weekdays though, the line is out the door.","It really depends on the day for this location.\n\nSome days your burrito comes out HUGE, others they seem much smaller than usual. This time, they had run out of steak and had to quickly prepare it- a lot of it came out quite rare. I like rare steak, but I can see how some people may not enjoy it. Also, the girl helping at the register seemed a little frazzled; there was a cup of hot salsa that she had forgotten to put onto someone else's tray, she put it on ours. When we told her it didn't belong to us, she picked it up, and a few seconds later put it back on our tray. She also forgot to put my burrito in a small tray, so I asked her for one.. Hopefully she was new.\n\nEven when the line is long, they always manage to get people through relatively quickly, which I always appreciate.","I always like going to this Chipotle.  It is always fast.  I went there today at about 11:30 am for lunch, but about 20 people in front of me.  It took less than ten minutes for me to order and get my food.  The workers are all so friendly and efficient.  This Chipotle has it down to a science on getting people in and out FAST.  The only complaint I have is my steak burrito had 4 pieces of meat that was either just fat or some other beef part that was chewy and inedible.  Next time I'll stick with the chicken or carnitas, what I usually get.  Other than this it was a very good burrito.","One of the better Chipotle's I've been too. Food is always fresh and tasty :). My go to \"fast food\" place as I wouldn't call it a real restaurant. Chicken Burrito bowls with pinto beans and everything is so good! So happy that this place is so close to where I live now, because my previous location didn't have a Chipotle joint for over 10 miles :(.","Quick and fresh.  Friendly staff.  Wear a sweater if you're eating there when its warm outside. They blast the air conditioning.","Thank you chipotle for giving me a burrito the size of my small asian d...oughnut.\n\nBy normal food standards this place is a four star but by chipotle standards I give it  three stars. I ordered a steak burrito, now if you have ever been to chipotle you know that they load their burritos to the max to where it's just too big for your mouth to get a good bite in, but sadly this burrito was just normal burrito. It wasn't that chipotle burrito where I felt my taste buds getting a massage from the burrito gods. In fact, I bet the burrito gods were highly disappointed with this burrito and its maker. \n\nIt's $6.75 for the steak burrito usually I'm content with that price, but it was meh this time. Went here around the afternoon and this place wasn't really busy, maybe it was because its near the gym :D.\n\n*~*~The workers here really do skimp on their food, the portions are so small.*** I mean if you're into burritos that are small and potentially could've been amazing then go for it but if not head to another chipotle location.\n\nTIP: You can get extra rice, lettuce, beans, corn, and fajitas for free just ask for it. Extra meat cost extra doe.","A very clean and nice place to get a chicken bowl with guacamole on the side,it was crowded about a 10 mins. wait in line.Was greeted by the friendly staff which was really cool on this HOT day in N.L.V.only one complaint is that the seating is too close.","Yay! I'm a fan.\n\nThis place is quickly turning into my back-up plan if I forget to pack a lunch.  If I'm not feeling for anything in particular, I'd probably hit this place up.  And that doesn't count the times when I just plain hanker for Chipotle's.\n\nI can't, and will not, call this place Mexican, but man do they know how to use Mexican flare.  I'm also not a fan of chain/franchise restaurants, but somehow I'm okay with this place.  Two aspects that usually make me run away are overwhelmed by the fact that they know how to make one tastey, healthy meal.  I see nothing but quality ingredients before me, and I couldn't be happier to taste them not minutes later.\n\nKey is to avoid the lunch rush if at all possible, but even so, there's outdoor seating.  If you're not in the mood for meat, note that their awesome guacamole is free in vegetarian burritos.  If you're in the mood for many meats, why not get a taco for each of them.  If you're in the mood to watch your carbs/calories, just get the burrito bowl.  Fast food done right for once.","Love Chipotle!  Fresh, healthy, inexpensive!  I'm a Mexican food lover.  As much as I like to be served, Chipotle offers a great casual sit down environment but just without the server.  They gave you the gigantic amount of food which gives you the value you won't find it anywhere else.  My son loves to come here to hang out with his friends.  He can afford to pay from his allowance money and have a great time with his buddy.  My favorite order is burrito bowl with steak with EVERYTHING they have.  I love the rice, black beans, grilled veggie, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, lettuce.  Yes, that's everything.  I also like the chicken.  If I try to be healthier, I'll order chicken without the sour cream and guacamole for less cholesterol.  Otherwise, steak is the one for me.  \n\nTheir employees are very friendly and efficient.  Usually there's a line, but I can always get my food in 10 minutes.  Great service and good food!","Great inexpensive food - I especially like having vegan options!","CHIPOTLE! Been here numerous times and I haven't had a bad experience yet. Every time I come here, I always get the burrito bowl cuz if you think about it, you actully get more food than if you ordered a burrito itself and its less messy cuz you are eating it with a fork! Dont get get me wrong, a burrito is still good but messy cuz the contents tend to spill out cuz of the enormous size factor. You cant go wrong with whatever type of meat you pick. I usually get the steak. Occasionally I would get the barbacoa or carnitas. Just recently they added brown rice to their simple menu. I love brown rice so that just gave me all the more reason to eat here! If I could I would eat here for everytime I see a subway! Not to bag on subway, but I dont think you can beat the real meat they use here and I love the sauteed veggies they have. They seem to cook it perfect every time! You know, its cooked to the point that its still crispy but soft enough to chew properly. The different kinds of salsa, sour cream, and guacomole are the icing on the cake!","If Chipotle had a frequent flyer card, I'd be in trouble. And so would they. I come to this one so often that I could probably walk out of there with the correct order without even saying a word. This is a problem for many of my pairs of pants and sometimes my wallet, but when the service and food are consistent, well then popping a few buttons is just a risk I'm willing to take.\n\nIf you've been to Chipotle before, you know the drill. The employees aren't extraordinarily outstanding, but they've always provided decent customer service and can move a line of 40+ deep out of there pretty fast. Yes, the line can get long between 11am-1pm, so if you're looking for an in and out lunch experience during those hours, you likely won't get it. This isn't to the fault of the staff-everyone has a different order and some people are making up burritos that don't exist which can dig into the wait time. There's almost no seating during those hours, but they do have a patio which can be utilized during the four weeks of the year when it's safe to sit outside without getting sun poisoning.\n\nThe manager at this location is super nice and I've seen her quite frequently working the line, cleaning tables and running the register. That's generally a sign of good management and I think it sets a really great example for her staff.\n\nDefinitely one of the better options for lunch if you work in the area.","BURRITO HEAVEN =) i always seem to show up with my stomach rumbling and ready for it to be satisfied ....ALWAYS works lol the menu isnt so elaborate but its enough for me =)","How horrible to give me a terrible attitude while i am ordering food from your resturant. I dont care if your having a bad day, you shouldnt treat customers with such horrible attitude! \nFirst my bowl had no food in it! What is that when i have to keep asking to ut more in my bowl? I aske for lettuce i got literally 3 pieces of lettuce, asked for more please and she gave me such a horrible attitude... Had to ask again! \nMakes me sick i had to pay 7.50$ for half an oder of what i ordered! \nCrap service i cant believe this place! Check my photo!","Very disappointed, its my first time eating at this place and charged me an extra $1.65 for guacamole.  Thats like another 2burritos from taco bell, what a ripped off and never comin back again....","When I first moved here this was the first place I was told to go to. I'm glad I did! This place is great for some yummy mexican food. It's kind of small but it's a nice relaxed atmosphere. Food is aaamazing and the service was good. I try not to go around lunch time though because it gets super busy!"],"business_id":"RhoB2ScipRhp1LyggfdVwA","name":"Chipotle's Mexican Grill","categories":["Fast Food","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["A couple co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch today since we are working in the Downtown area.  At first, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I didn't realize Downtown and any decent places to eat like this but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nArea - clean and next to the Mob Museum.\n\nFood - similar to fusion style.  I ordered the chicken Milanese torta.  Very tasty!  I enjoyed this very much.  It was a fairly good portion, however I thought the price was a bit steep.  $10.00 for my order, it came with a small side of chips but no drink.\n\nRestaurant - airy, clean, cafeteria style setting.  Many of the people working in the surrounding areas were having lunch there so this place would be good for a business luncheon.\n\nStaff - friendly.. not much more to say.\n\nMaybe when it's pay day or I feel like splurging a bit on bar-style food I'll make a trip back here.  I also want to try their happy hour.","The commissary is a trendy Latin-fusion kitchen off of 3rd street in downtown Vegas. Walking in, a coffee bar is off to the right, a bar (fully stocked) is straight in the back, and the kitchen area is off to the left.\n\nUpon reaching the kitchen area, the electronic (television) menus were able to be read for about 30 seconds before they turned off and you had to turn around and look at the second tv to keep perusing the menu (read: annoying). \n\nI ordered the fish torta. It sounded good: crispy fish, tartar sauce with poblano chiles in it, and cabbage. Approximately $12. I asked if the sandwich was spicy. The cashier didn't know, so the managing chef came out and talked to me about it which was a nice touch. The wait for the food wasn't long - maybe 5-7 minutes.\n\nUpon receiving my food I received a sandwich-looking Torta with chips. It was a large sandwich, cut in half. Upon taking a bite I wasn't very pleased with the taste or texture. It was as bland as you could possibly get (and with fish, it can get pretty bland), and definitely was not worth my $12. Seriously, this place has potential, but they would do well to focus more on the quality and taste of their food.","The girl at the counter had a difficult time taking our simple order. She also messed it up. Beautiful seating and decor. My beverage was mediocre.","Came during happy hour and had a great time. Had the brisket burrito which was very good. My wife and I thought the food was good the prices were more than fair and the ambience was perfect for what we were looking for. The manager came by and chatted which was nice. We will definitely come back.","3.5\n\nCame here for breakfast and dinner (2 nights) while staying at the Grand. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was pretty good.\n\nBreakfast:\nI got the crepe with chocolate and strawberry, which was just chocolate syrup and strawberry jelly (or jam). It was ok. I've definitely had better crepes. Hearty ones with real fruit and nutella, but this was just syrup. And the crepe itself wasn't great.\n\nAlso had the breakfast burrito. They were out of sausage, so we got ham, egg and cheese. It was good. Didn't blow my mind... I've had better, but not bad.\n\nDinner:\nOne night, I got the tacos. I chose 1 chicken and 2 latin smoked brisket. Really good!. The latin smoked brisket was especially yum. I got this with the Mexican rice (you get 2 sides with the taco plate). I didn't care for it. My husband got the bacon burger, which I tried, and it was good. He liked it too.\n\nFor dinner on our second night I got a turkey burger, which I enjoyed. Also got the onion rings, which I wasn't crazy about. Too big and the onion just fell right out when you'd take a bite.\n\nThe place itself is cool. I love the set-up and decor. I do agree with other reviewers that it was a bit confusing as to where to order. I would definitely come again, to try other things on the menu. And if anything, I know the latin smoked brisket tacos will satisfy me.","It was time for a one on one lunch with my favorite assistant!  I was super excited to try this place out.  It's literally a block away from my job and I've heard the place is awesome.  On top of that, the Commissary was offering a 50% discount for all Nevada locals in the month of January.  It was literally, a no brainer.  \n\nThe Commissary is located on the corner of 3rd and Stewart Ave.  This Latin Kitchen is part of the Grand hotels and one of the many new joints downtown.  Lots of seating, inside and out!  Walk up the stairs and you'll notice a very trendy vibe and decor.  White tiled pillars with decorated mirrors, exposed loft style ceilings.  Lots of different material textures:  Stainless steel, tiling, concrete floors, wooden cabinets.  Really modern and trendy!  There are different types of seating for different types of dining interests:  tables, plush booth seating, high top tables and even a bar for drinks and bar seating.  So awesome!  In this bistro type eatery, you literally order your food, they'll give you a buzzer and you'll approach the counter again once your buzzer goes off.  Speaking of food, here's what I got and thought!\n\nThey have Smart water, two sizes.  I got the small on for $2.49\n\nI started off with the chips and salsa/guacamole appetizer for $4.00.  This is a GREAT deal.  It came in a big bowl, filled with tortilla chips and two ramekins filled with salsa and guac.  The guac was chunky and filled with chopped tomatoes and onions.  The salsa was AH-MAZE-ING!  It was super smokey, like they've added chipotle or ancho chili peppers. So awesome.  Little spicy but really made a wonderful difference!  For the price along, super worth it!\n\nFor my meal, I got the Caesar salad for $7 and added chilled chicken breast for an additional $4.  The Caesar salad along was romaine lettuce, parmesan cheese, torn homemade croutons and classic dressing.  The chicken breast was seasoned with kosher salt and pepper, perfectly seasoned, juicy and fresh!  The salad was a little salty.  Almost really fishy.  You could tell the dressing was homemade though.  The anchovy taste was super prominent, almost dominant at times.  The croutons were amazing though!  torn bread slices, toasted to resemble croutons.  It was crunchy, yet buttery and creamy!  Hard to explain but so good.  The parmesan cheese was shaved on to the salad.  One of the biggest fans of shaved cheese on salads, as opposed to shredded.  At the end of the day, I still felt the salad was delicious.  \n\nMy first experience was very good, overall.  Although it seems like a I got a lot of stuff, keep in mind that it's still 50% off on dining for the rest of January 2014.  Great promotion and because of my experience, I'm definitely going back soon!  Thanks so much for a wonderful lunch, guys!  If you downtown, you're in luck!  Check out this new joint :)","I've dined at The Commissary twice now.  The food has been of high quality and the value is great, with the exception of the gelato milkshake.  There was nothing about it that warranted an $8 price tag.  It didn't even bring the boys to the yard!\n\nOn my first visit, I had the Caesar salad.  I enjoyed it, but the dressing was surprisingly spicy.  This may not go over well with your typical Caesar consumer.  On my second visit I had the brisket burrito.  I would say this was far better than Chipotle.  \n\nThere are a few things that keep The Commissary from receiving five stars.  The first thing is service.  I found the people taking my order on both occasions didn't seem exceptionally knowledgeable and on the second visit my order was incorrect.  I attribute this to the fact the restaurant is relatively new.\n\nI also was a little unsure about the atmosphere.  I found the music to be a little on the loud side on my first visit, making it hard to converse with my dinner companion.  On my second visit, I contemplated getting coffee from the adjacent coffee bar and popping out the iPad to get a little work done.  I discovered that The Commissary does not offer free WiFi, which kept me from ordering coffee.  In keeping with coffee bar atmosphere, I would think free WiFi would be a must.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed The Commissary, but not enough to go out of my way to visit again.","The cubano was pretty good.  The habanero mustard was actually pretty spicy and I like spicy things. The place is overpriced for what it is however. So that's what kept the stars rating at 3.","Delicious!  The meat is tender and everything is fresh.  I had the torta and it was amazing.  I love the set up of this place.  I haven to say that originally even though the set up is nice I was a bit sceptical but they exceeded my expectations.  I absolutely recommend this place to my friends.  I work at zappos so it looks like i found a new spot for lunch!","I work downtown and was so excited this place just opened. First off--the bar, coffee area and gelato looks great. Things that would be pretty hard to mess up. I got a Mexican bowl salad that made Chipotle look like a four star meal. The barbacoa was WAY over spiced/flavored and there was shredded lettuce that was very minimal. The Spanish rice was saturated in seasonings and half way THROUGH my lunch I was feeling ill. I wasn't the only one, my coworkers had the burgers and all of our tummies are not doing well. I hope the quickly correct these bad reviews before this place becomes consistently avoided.","Okay, so walk in and like the vibe immediately. Chill laid back restaurant with a nice smaller bar inside. The staff is really friendly and slightly younger than most. They have a nice selection on beer for a \"Mexican\" restaurant they don't have that many tequila choices. The good was slightly above average. I got the side of chips and salsa. And for the entree I got the Cubano Torta, it was just okay could have been WAY better but they are only like 3 weeks old.","Food:\nThe food is average at best and over priced at regular prices. I don't know who this famous Sandoval guy is but he must not think very highly of himself for serving store bought chips. Even low end Mexican restaurants have fresh chips. The salsa, both medium and hot were boring.. \"Celebrity chef\" Sandoval needs to take notes from the salsa offering at the taco bar in Mariana's grocery store park lot.\nThe rotisserie chicken has good flavor but was dried out. The rice was decent. Black beans have no flavor. Very bland mashed up  black beans. I mixed the salsa in to add some flavor but the salsa needed help itself.\nThe crispy chicken Milanese torta was average. Light corn breading on a thin piece of chicken breast. \n\nService:\nCounter service. You order get a receipt bit how do you know when your food is ready. I went and sat down. They took my name but never called my name. I sat and sat and sat.... Eventually I got up to ask where my food was and it was just sitting on the counter.","Wow what a dining experience. My husband and I have lunch and dinner at the Commissary Friday. We are still talking about the food, but much more incredible the  staff and our new favorite Chef, Chef Chris! We thought we would check out this new celebrity Chef offering by Richard Sandoval's Commissary. We walked in and where very impressed with the vibe the Commissary has. We looked around for a couple minutes before we went to the window to order some food. We where greeted by a very nice young girl who took our order, she couldn't have been nicer. My husband ordered the Cuban, and I had the soup. O my goodness that was the most incredible soup I have ever eaten. We where waiting on our order that's when we where greeted by Chef Chris, he was a very nice young man. He asked us where we lived and how long we have been in town, he spoke to us as if we where old friends, before we knew it our food was ready, we where told he would check on us before we left. We found our seats, my husband told me to taste his sandwich it was delicious. I'm not a big pork fan but I will say it was to die for, my soup was so balanced in flavor  it was spicy tomato bisque!  It was the best soup ever! Chef came over to see how our meal was. We told him how great everything was. We chatted for a few minutes he asked us to come back anytime and ask for him, it's service like this that makes a dining experience so much more then a meal. Chef Sandoval you have a great Chef at the Commissary, we are so happy we ate at the Commissary. We came in for dinner that night, Chris was there greeted us by name, needless to say our dinner was just as impressive as our lunch Chef send us over Gelato at no charge. We thanked him, told him we would see him soon! We have a new place we will make our new hang out. Chef Chris thank you for making us more than just guest you treated us like old friends... \n\nLinda and James Walker","Don't get the horchata, it's $4 and tastes like half and half with a dash of cinnamon.","Food first- Mexican grilled cheese with chips. I am not from Mexico but the name sake of The Commissary is. I expected this grilled cheese to take me to Mexico instead I got taken to Applebee's.\nFAIL\nThe sandwich has avocado & tomatoes but no flavor.\nBUT, loved the caliente salsa with the chips. I asked for their hottest salsa & it is yummy. So are the chips! \nDisclosure: I used a $5 off deal.\nI should have mirrored my friend who got rotisserie chicken & raved about it!\nWe had happy hour drinks too and I'd give both of mine a thumbs up- the mojito was tasty and the margarita was even better! \nI don't know where to start with the crazy multi food counters/confusing ordering process but sometimes different is not better.","So Freakin' good!! Love the atmosphere, love the food (so fresh) and fantastic service--Jessica, Jesus, and Eric Rock!","Do not be fooled, this is a fancy food court. \n\n\nThe only difference between the commissary and a regular food court is that you  order from one location. There is an odd mixture of  Mexican food and burgers /bar food. You order at the bar and are given a pager. You find a seat wait a while a then go to the station that prepares the type of food you  ordered and pick it up.\n\n\nThe Good:\nAtmosphere is modern and very clean  with plenty of seating. The bar area is cozy and has a good selection beers on tap. The variety is interesting if you are trying to please a group of people with varied. \n\nThe Bad:\nCo worker and I went for lunch, spent several minutes wandering around trying to find out how to place an order. There is an ambiguous order here sign above the bar, with no further details. The only two menus are pasted to the bar counter, one was at the register and the other was under one of  bar patron's lunch.  After placing your order  you are left to figure out which station has your food. The burgers station is pretty easy, but  the other two stations look to be split between hot and cold entrees,but there was no definitive signage to that effect.\n\nFood was awful.  I ordered tortilla soup and a bacon cheeseburger. Both items were presented well and looked delicious. Tortilla soup was very runny and tasted like strained corn chips and velveta. There were also lumps of something that I assume was chicken, but I could be wrong. Bacon cheeseburger was the SALTIEST thing I have ever eaten in my life! I removed the bacon hoping to cut the salty taste only to realize that it was not the bacon. I wasn't able to finish half the burger due to the crazy amount of salt. I am still tasting salt. \n\nCo-worker had the same burger and the nacho fries. His burger was just as salty as mine. The nacho fries were blah, cheese and salt and fries. \n\nWe have to go back to try the \"latin\" food (just to make sure this isn't a case of ordering hamburger at a sushi restaurant.), But i am not looking forward to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo worker ordered","I'm kinda digging this place. I had the cubano torta (Mexican/Cuban sandwich), it's pretty big. The martinis are good and the salsa is caliente (not for gringos).\n\nPlus they have gelato. I had the spicy chocolate gelato stout float (yup, beer and ice cream). It was awesome.","My husband and I went for lunch this week.  The atmosphere is cute and very bright, the food is meh.\n\nHubs ordered the bacon burger with no bun and I ordered the bacon-wrapped hotdog.  We both ordered sweet potato fries and iced tea.  Aside from the price (over 30 bucks for lunch), the food was much like we would expect from any of the cookie-cutter casino cafes around town.  \n\nOur food looked nothing like the pictures (and I don't just mean that is wasn't styled) and the sweet potato fries were actually tots.\n\nWe'll maybe give them a couple of months to settle in and try again, but I can't recommend then to anyone.  Stick to Smashburger for burgers.","The chicken is wonderful... it's moist and juicy.  The burritos were great, too.  Awesome place to have a casual lunch or dinner.  The one thing that is confusing is how to order food.  They should make that easier to figure out at first blush.","Four of us went there on Friday night and it had a decent crowd for being 9:00 pm.\nWe walked up to the chicken station and they said we had to order from the next station. There was also a salad station that was closed.\nWe ordered our food and while I was ordering I was watching on of the chef's plating another customers order.\nEverything was fine until he reached his BARE hand into the tortilla chips and put them on the plate.\nHe then walked the plates to the counter and waited for the customer to pick up their order.\nI stood up there with my iphone in hand waiting for my order to get plated. I realized we ordered chips and salsa.\nThe chef started putting our order together and sure enough he put his BARE hand back into the bowl of tortilla  chips and put them on my plate and walked up to the window.\nWhen he handed me my 2 plates I asked him if he expected me to eat those chips that he used his BARE hand to put on my plate.\nHe looked confused and I told him I captured what he did on my phone.\nHe took the one plate and dumped the whole order in the trash and said he would remake my order.\n\nI took my wife's plate to her * she was smart and didn't order any chips ) and we waited and waited for my meal.\nI asked to speak to the manager and he said the chef in the white coveralls was in charge.\nNeedless to say I told them I didn't want my order anymore and I didn't care if the refunded me.\nMy wife ordered the brisket and it came out looking like pulled pork. It had a good flavor and the sweet potato fries we tasty.\nI really wanted to enjoy this place, but having someone in charge use their bare hand in a bowl of chips after I saw him doing other chef duties and wiping sweat from his forehead with his hand and sleeve, kind of made me think twice about coming back.\nHe did apologize and I noticed he put a glove on his hand for the next customer's order.","Wish I could give negative stars. When you walk into the place it looks really cool. Then you realize how unorganized the place is.   Too many different places to order, that it is confusing. Sat at the bar and ordered two burgers. The kitchen tried to make our burger twice and screwed up both times. Kitchen can not read a simple ticket. Left frustrated without trying the food","This is a split review for the Torta-Mexican Counter and the Bar.\n\nFirst off, the concept of this place is cool with very hip and comtempo decor. It is basically a big \"cafeteria\" with food booths, a bar, and a coffee/ice cream place. I ate at the Torta place and had the half and half combo of the tortilla soup and the chicken milanese combo. I honestly thought $12 was a bit pricey for a soup and sandwich combo (that does no include your drink) at a place that is cafeteria style-food and service. The torta was actually pretty tasty and the tortilla soup had nice presentation with some spice, but the chicken in the soup tasted a little off and one piece had a bone in it, so I could not finish eating it as I was turned off it. That was my only experience with the food portion. The place looked pretty deserted when I got there, but I am attributing that to it being a weekday in DTwn Vegas and the hotel it is attached to, the Downtown Grand, having just opened in November. However, the staff that took the order didn't really seem to know what was going on and it was a bit weird trying to figure the place out. Since nobody was there, they just kinda said \"hey, your food's ready\" even though they had given me a pager that was supposed to light up when the food was ready for pick up. The soda fountain is also self-serve, so honestly, I was confused as to the was the \"tip\" line on my receipt was for. I don't tip when I go into a Taco Bell or McD's and that's pretty much the level of service you're getting here. So, two stars for this portion of the experience. Hopefully, they can sort out the kinks and find what works and what doesn't because this IS a cool concept.\n\nNow on to the Bar. Totally different experience here. From the moment I sat down, Jesus greeted me and you could just tell he had a good energy. He was engaging and funny and won me over when he let me sample a beer to see if I would like it. The other awesome guy of the evening was Michael, the Manager. He really did an excellent job of \"putting the customer first\" and really went out of his way to make my experience here awesome! They had an amazing beer selection and the beer flights they offered were well selected and priced. There was a flight called the Beer Belly that had some quality beers on it (5) for only $13. I was originally told they were not serving it because they didn't have the glassware yet, but Michael did me a solid and made it happen. I was in beer HEAVEN! They also have a great selection of Dia de Los Muertos beers from Mexico. I had the Hefe and it was great! The bottles are also worth collecting! Michael said they will also be having specialty tequila flights soon, which would just add to the fantastic cocktail and beer selections they already have. They made my night even better by letting me use the 20% off coupon I got in my welcome packet on my beer flight. So all in all a fun experience and exceptional customer service at the Bar. 5-stars across the board!\n\nI would usually split the diff on the stars, but I had such a good time at the Bar, it compensated for the bad food experience. I definitely need to check the Coffee/Ice Cream place out next time I am in town as it looked delish! But, either way, I will def be back to the Bar!","Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend on a Wednesday afternoon. The staff was friendly and helpful and everything was impeccably clean and I enjoyed the decor, loved the tufted sofas we sat on! My cobb salad was pretty uninspiring for the price, however. There wasn't much that enticed me on the menu and I doubt I'd go back... maybe for a fancy milkshake, but the menu wasn't clear enough on what that entailed for me to lay down 9 clams for it. Just not the lunch spot for me.","My first time here, not sure where to go once you walk in, but once I figured it out I ordered a \"Pepito\" probably the best torta I have ever had.  Carne asada with all the fixings and I have to say it was amazing.","Really! 17.00 for a mini Cobb salad I had to wait 25 minutes for. It's not like there was a big rush either. Overpriced food and be patient because they are slow.","Wandered in after visiting Mob Museum and so glad we did!  Smoky Latin food with incredible depth of flavor.  We had the tortilla soup and burrito bowl, which were both exceptional.  In addition, Ancho rubbed chicken wings were fantastic.  Add Mexican craft beer selection and top shelf margaritas, and this is reason enough to head downtown for lunch","Ok so went back and ordered the full sandwich and soup.  It came with chips also, which you do not get when you get suckered into the half soup half sandwich thing.  This time: I felt like I got what I paid for!  Much better and will be back!!","We only visited the coffee bar section at the Commissary,which has coffee drinks, bagels, breakfast burritos, crepes, and gelato.  It's handy and affordable when you want to grab a fairly quick breakfast.  My bagel was decent and they were generous with the cream cheese without and extra charge.  The husband said the burrito was decent.  Overall, for what it is, I recommend it.  I'll post more if we ever eat lunch or dinner here.","More like a quasi-Latin kitchen.  The Latin food is there if you want it, but you can also get burgers, and most of the coffee selections are hardly Latin. \n\nAt first, I got a frappe coffee drink, a \"frigid mocha latte\".  For $6.00 for a 16 ounce blended coffee drink, it was a overpriced, but very tasty. \n\nAt another counter, I got a double burger.  The only choice for cheese was cheddar, but the burger was actually a relative bargain, at $8.25.  The two greasy patties with nicely melted cheese, with tomato, lettuce and onion, turned out to be a good choice. \n\nThis was tough for me to judge as it's more like 3.5 stars, but for Yelp ratings I pushed it up to 4 stars due to the inviting eclectic decor, and I really like that it's off the beaten path, compared to so much of downtown.   As it's just across the street from the Mob Museum, it's also a good choice before/after a trip to that museum.","After a friend's review, I expected the baristas/fountain workers at the Lavazza Coffee Cafe to be exceptional, and they were lackluster. No sense of excitement or urgency with this twosome when it came to me. The next guest was obviously a regular and they knew his order before he asked, even knew his usual partner in crime's! I will attribute my experience to super high expectation. \nMy latte was made with care, the barista melted the honey I requested in the bottom of the cup before adding ice and milk. I was not asked what milk I wanted, but it turned out fine.\nI will pop back in tomorrow and see if they are more lively in the afternoons.","We finally ventured out to try this new place today, and were pleasantly surprised by the addition to our neighborhood! We both had the Cubano torta, which consisted of a nice thin black forest ham, carnitas style pulled pork, melty Swiss cheese, thin fresh pickles, and a habanero mustard on a fresh hoagie roll done panini style. I loved it! I added more yellow mustard to mine, but the fella enjoyed his dressed as is. Both came with chips and salsa, I ordered a side of delicious fresh guacamole with mine. We also shared a side of onion rings which were beer battered and perfectly fried. I had a Piña agua fresca which was not too sweet as well.\nThe decor is nice, with almost a touch of posh, and the seating areas are expansive. There are tables out on Third Street, little booth/bistro tables on one end, and armchairs with small tables on the other. We sat in a comfy booth with just enough room for our plates, and remarked on the way out how we should have set up outside. Also did not sample the extensive beer selection or coffee and gelato offering. Next visit it's affogatos on the stoop, y'all!","Chicken tacos were flavorful and the accompanying beans and rice were very filling. Fun place to hang and have a drink. Staff is very friendly and pleasant.","Amazing food, atmosphere and location! Stumbled upon this de-lish eatery while visiting the Mob Museum near Freemont St. All I can say is it was amazing! Everyone in our group enjoyed it immensely.","We went here because we wanted somewhere new to try and we saw a full ad with tons of their menu pictures in seven magazine. Everything looked so amazing from a pretzel shake and this corn concoction and other things. We got to the place and was very confused as to where to order and where to sit. Once we went to the counter, the staff was very friendly and even custom made my order because I can't stand anything spicy, and literally everything on their menu to do with meat, was spicy. We noticed they didn't have a few of the items that were shown in the ad we saw which was only a week before-hand. Everything was tasting good but the sweet potato tots were so gross they tasted like they were out of a frozen bag that had freezer burn. \n\nFor desert we decided to try a milkshake thinking they would have the pretzel one we saw in the ad. Sure enough, they didn't. Even the lady that worked there said it was false advertising. I had my heart set on that damn milkshake. She seemed like she didn't really know the menu because I asked if she can make something similar and wasn't too sure. If you like weird tasting gelato, this is the place to go. Beer flavored. Pistachio (which some people think would be normal, me not so much), Spicy chocolate..etc.\n\nAnywho, I should have just brought the freaking ad in and told them to make whatever I saw on it. \n\nFALSE ADVERTISING.","Good food but all three people I went with got food poisoning.  All three had rotisserie chicken. Won't be going back soon.","Now, I have to agree with Kelly R. on this review.  DO NOT BE SUCKERED IN TO GETTING HALF A SANDWICH AND SOUP.  I wanted the Mexican grilled cheese (which was amazing-goat cheese, tomatoes and avocado?  I dream of it) and the tortilla soup.  Well, the sandwhich was 8 bucks and the soup was 6.  For 14 bucks I could have had the whole sandwich and the whole soup, but instead I got half of each for 12 like Kelly says.  NOT WORTH IT.  However, the soup was amazing.  My friend got a burger and a huge order of chips/salsa and guac, so I know not EVERYTHING is expensive and small.  However, my other friend was also disappointed in the half salad/soup combo she was talked in to.  So just be careful ordering because you could end up with a little food for a lot of money, but the food is great.  Will go back for lunch.","Discovered this gem when staying at the Downtown Grand Hotel. (why doesn't the hotel publicize The Commissary???) This is a great concept for quick & easy foodservice and beverage. Not necessarily plush....but definitely comfortable, with great hospitality.\n\nGreat coffee shop (Jenny is awesome!) with Lavazza....'nuff said.The latin chicken for lunch was incredible moist and with just the \"right\" amount of spices. Perfect. \n\nAnd, the bar at The Commissary (bartender Adriana...another terrific asset to The Commissary) was exactly what is needed after a long day out and exploring LV. Manager Kris Sainsbury should be complimented for his attention to guests throughout my 3 day stay. Overall, a very well run operation, with great food & beverage options!\n\nThis hotel needs to promote The Commissary as I would never had known it was here other than I just \"happened\" to stay here. Downtown Las Vegas is on the rebound and I would get here quickly as I have no doubt that the crowds will be here soon.\n\nNow...if only they can figure out how to deal with the wind outside on the street so that we could have enjoyed the outside tables......\n\nWe will be back.","I ordered the half-and-half, which is half of a sandwich and a cup of soup. My sandwich was the Mexican grilled cheese, and my soup was sweet corn. The half-and-half is $12, which is ridiculously overpriced for the portion size. My sandwich was teeny (about 4 x 4 x 1 inches (who says food reviews can't have math?)), and the soup was about a full 8-oz cup. I was still hungry at the end of my meal. For $12, I really don't want to be hungry after I polish off my food. \n\nThe service was pretty good, and the food itself was decent tasting, comparable to Panera Bread and other sandwich chains. \n\nThe decor and furniture were also really, really cute, but I won't be returning.","We got the burger and fries. Very good! Unique bun and twist to a burger, with great flavor. Has a full bar and coffee cafe too. Really enjoyed everything.","I went on a trip to Vegas and stayed at the down town grand. I found myself eating at the commissary almost everyday. The food is good, fast and hot. You know it's fresh when they are making it in front of your eyes. Love the cubano torta which has ham, carnitas, and Swiss cheese press together in a panini machine. \nI wish I had a place like this in my home town. \nAlso, this place is the only walking distance for lattes, and coffee drinks! My fav is the dirty chai, it's a chai latte with two shots of espresso. Yum","Very nice place and deserves more stars that what it currently has. The place gets 4 stars because it's layout is a little confusing, and the shakes are just blended gelato. I thought they'd be a bit more adult and add toppings and booze. No such luck though. Cuban sandwich was great. \n\nGive it a shot. The food is really good and at a great price.","Good place and has a nice potential of becoming a mix for both, tourists and locals but the coffee shop doesn't have heavy cream. I am on the mission to find at least a couple of coffee shops in downtown that could make a cappuccino with heavy cream.","Our first 10 seconds in this place set the tone for our meal there... We walked in and were told to go order from the bar. Went to the bar to order and were told we needed to be ID'd bc we were at the bar, even though we had no plans on drinking and were just there to order. It was 2pm. Huh? Kinda weird. \n\nBut what the hell, since we were at the bar anyway and I saw Ayinger Bräu Weisse on the menu (spelled incorrectly), I ordered a brew. What came out was Anchor Steam Christmas Ale. Not. Even. Close. I get that they both start with 'A', but a bartender should know the menu. Strike 1. We order our food and move to a table. The table we sit at is so off kilter that one elbow on it made my beer spill out and all over my phone. Strike 2. \n\nThe buzzer goes off and we go pick up our food. My gf's salad looked decent, but had a spicy dressing on it that wasn't listed on the menu. Like a good boyfriend, I didn't trust her tastebuds and tried it myself. It 100% had a kick. She went to return it and didn't get a full tude, but def a nice 'wtf' stare from the chef. The salad was remade and brought out with a new dressing only it lacked the avocado that we paid extra for and the chicken was way undercooked. Strike 3. \n\nFor my meal, a half Cubano and soup combo, the soup looked like something you would be served in an airplane... flying coach. Progresso in a square plastic bowl. Eek. Saving grace? The Cubano was good! Would a full one be worth $12? NO. It's not a large 'wich at all. $12 can get you a yard of meats at Capriotti's. Instead, I recieved canned soup and half a sammie for that same amount. Weak. Strike 4. \n\nI want to 2-star it bc it wasn't the worst place out there and it's certainly appealing to the eyes, but I know deep down that in no way will I be back. 'Methinks not' is spot on.","Stayed at the Grand Hotel which the Commissary is apart of and this place is good. Happy Hour prices and choices are pretty good and the food is good too. I had a burger and it probably was the best burger I've ever had. Add in the friendly staff plus the good food and you've got to make a stop. Besides the burger and bar there is also coffee bar and a taco place. It was so good my friend's and I went twice. They don't open too late I don't think but if you are in the area and want a good burger and a beer, give The Commissary a try.","I really liked this place. From bacon wrapped hotdogs to Baja fish\"tortas\". It was all really good and fun casual atmosphere. I only wish they opened a little earlier.","I'm rating this place because I see the promise but this place really has some kinks to work out. First off, love the bar. Plenty of beers on tap, decent happy hour for drinks, and there's plenty of seating in a relaxed but chic type of presentation. Love that part.\n\nHated the part that as I'm going to the different stations I'm told I'll have to order from the bar. That's fine because it's slow but if the bar were to get packed and you only have two bartenders, doing things like...tending bar. People with food orders are going to start getting backed up. Weird concept if you expect it to be busy.\n\nI order the cubano, my friend orders a burrito, and the jerk off that wanted us to come in here to try the food just orders a coffee (wtf!). Anyway, I had a bite of the burrito with rotisserie chicken and the meat is actually pretty good. That coupled with the rice is actually pretty damn good. I'll be back for this.\n\nThe dry cubano on the other hand, I feel as though it's a little overpriced for $12 that came with no fries, maybe they forgot it, maybe it just doesn't come with it, I don't know. But $12 for basically just a sandwich and it's not sit down service? That's not crazy expensive but damn give me some fries, chips, f*ck I'll even take a deli pickle!\n\nAll in all a nice change of pace if you're gambling at Downtown Grand or you're leaving Gold Spike and want something quick instead of pizza. But it needs to work on some things.","Interesting concept but somehow not cohesive. There are 3 food stations, a bar and a coffee bar. You order from the bar, then pick up your food from a food station when your pager rings. We ordered a Craft Burger with grilled onions and cheese. It came as ordered on a shiny sesame toasted bun that reminded me of Bob's Big Boy from 40+ years ago! Sweet potato tots were yummers. Not sure what the addictive little sprinkles were, but they were good. We also had a Chicken Milanese Torta. Again the bread was really good, but the chicken mediocre and the bean purée made everything slide around. Also needed more sauce on the roll. I'm going to give this place another try based on the good, especially since it's their first day. Staff is nice and exceptionally trained. \nI hope they add table service here.","I've gone to The Commissary a few times, and I've always ordered their burritos. The burritos are always a win-win. \n\nI tried being adventures today, so I ordered the Pepito torta (mexican sandwich). Totally disappointing. There wasn't a lot of carne asada on it, and the sandwich well flat in flavor and taste. I ordered the sandwich with a side of dipping sauce, which I believe was supposed to be like an enchilada sauce, but it was bland and tasted more like tomato paste. Also, the sauce cost an extra $2. \n\nThe two star is because I didn't get a flavorful or fulfilling meal, and I paid $15.31. The prices are a bit steep, but again, the burritos are worth it. Guess I'll stick with that next time:)"],"business_id":"UVBBO66nLPhWefDVMwi1XA","name":"The Commissary Latin Kitchen by Richard Sandoval","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Popped in for an impromptu dinner. Fab friendly service & delicious food at a great price. This was my second or third visit in the last few months and I think I've tried/tasted most of the menu. There's nothing there I don't like. Good food at a good price.","Another place having a laugh at £4.50 a pint. Not a bad change decor-wise though, apart from the unsightly breeze block-supported table.","Funky lower level bar with decor that looks like it might've been the brainchild of H.R. Giger, but in reality is made of Caterpillar treads and the like. Not the most comfortable, but definitely good conversation starters!\n\nNice barstaff, decent prices, and a very good drinks selection. We had some nibbles as well and they were quite tasty. I'd certainly head back on one of our many trips to Edinburgh.","Place is OK but I have to be honest I'm not gastro-pub's fan. Drinking a beer and smell of burgers all of the time, it isn't perfect match for me.... but if you like...","This was a dissapointment - we have visited here several timesover the last 3-4 years and it has indeed hardly changed - shame. I would've liked the see this bar maturing a bit. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the atmosphere and the weird corners nooks and crannies, I can even get the dim light (I think) but the restaurant part has always been a mystery (like its food) you never know what you may get / is available to order - what you do get is good cooked food - simple, harty fair. No wasted green garnishes. The mismatched cutlery is fun for the first time, cute-adorable even. But it is difficult to take them serious as a restaurant. - More a .. mm.. toko? Liking to a Mexican Road Cafe. \n\nMy next visit will be just for the bar.","Totally dont uunderstand this place........at all....!\n\nAre you a Mexican restaurant....are you a pub......what are you? The food is ok - the wine is questionable for the price - ther service is ok.\n\nIts just a bit pointless - great location going to waste in my opinion.","i'd not been to the basement in over two years, so when drinks were planned and this was the place suggested i was curious to check it out again.  what i had been told was that it had finally been re-furbished so i was interested to see how it had changed and if it finally got the face lift it so desperately needed!!\n\nhow i remember the basement is a fairly good space, one half for dining and one half for drinks at the bar but very dark and very very loud.  on walking in on thursday night the first thing i noticed was how light it was!  complete change from before and all the furniture was brightly coloured as well which really gave the place a nice feel.  the bar area felt more spacious than before (that might be because i could see it better...) and there is even a small side room with space for about a dozen people that adds to the space.  i'm not sure if they did something to deal with the noise, but sitting in the small side room i definitely felt like this place wasn't as loud as it used to be.  so that's also a positive!\n\ni'm not sure what the food menu is like as i was only there for drinks, but the drinks menu looks good.  they have a good choice of cocktails, with a focus on tequila based ones and a decent variety of beers.  the wine list is ok, a bit small for my liking but enough choice that i still found a red i wanted.  since i only had red wine i'm leaving my rating for the basement a bit on the low side until i go back to try out the food.  but from what i saw the other night this place definitely looks improved and hopefully my rating will go up once i've had a meal there :)","Great Mexican food! Lunchtime was quiet so go at that time if you don't like it too busy. Drinks were great and the service was too. Sarah is lovely!","I first visited the Basement as a wee young thing back in 1996 when I first moved to Edinburgh. I still try to visit every time I am back in town. It's comforting how little it has changed in all that time: same dim, cosy atmosphere; comfort grub; good selection of drinks, and the staff still have to wear those garish aloha shirts.\n\nNever change, Basement. I'll always love you.","The Basement is one of my favourite Edinburgh gastro-pubs. The food has always been consistently good and the atmosphere relaxed and friendly. \n\nOn my latest visit I had the fish pie with boiled potatoes and salad followed by one of the best sticky toffee puddings I've ever had. \n\nThe fish pie was a very generous portion and came in at around £8.50. Packed full of salmon and topped with mashed potato, it filled a large hole and was delicious. The sticky toffee pudding was the size of a doorstop and drowned in pouring cream. YUM. \n\nOther good bets on the menu are the burrito and steak pie. I've had the burrito and it's fab; the steak pie looks amazing too. \n\nHighly recommended for an affordable meal, with an extensive drinks' menu to boot. Staff are decked out in Hawaiian shirts and are chatty and great for food recommendations. \n\nThere's also a bar which is frequently packed. I've only really eaten in the restaurant but it gets two thumbs up. \n\nAll in all, well worth a visit. Go go go!","So good, we had to go back twice while there on a long weekend (which I am ashamed to say).  Good selection of beer, reasonable amount of seating and good crowd.","Don't let the Hawaiian shirts fool you, this basement situated bar and restaurant is actually a Mexican themed establishment...I think? Well, whatever, I like the mix of banter and general good vibes you receive from this bar when you head down the stairs, and what I did approve of was that it was quite dark, but had just the right level of soft, glowing lighting, which is always flattering, and makes everyone look hot. (Note: Good for a successful date, as you don't have to worry about the horror of bright lights showing up any facial imperfections).\n\nAnyway, I felt instantly chilled out and relaxed in here, like it was where I'd been hanging out for years, when in fact this was only the third time I'd thought of visiting The Basement in however many years of living in Edinburgh. Shame on me for being foolish and wasting my time in the same old, tired joints, because The Basement is ace. There's definitely an earthy, Aztec feel going on with the walls, quite like having a party in a cosy cave, and there's one of those neon beer bottle signs hanging up at the window, which I always approve of. There's also what looks like a couple of dentist's chairs from some kind of horror film, with a sort of steel spine that winds backwards, teamed with a table with a similar chain, tread idea going on underneath it. That was what our little group identified it as anyway, pretty much like some kind of art exhibit you can have drinks on, very cool.\n\nFood was tasty too, my friend enjoyed his generous portion of steak and mashed potato, while I shared the simple but stomach pleasing nachos, cheese, salsa, jalapenos and sour cream dish. I'll definitely be coming back on a non-school night, when I can be more debaucherous and sample one of the tequilas or Mexican beers on offer.","I don't quite get the allure of this place.  I've been a few times, sometimes for drinks and sometimes for food, and each time I do, it's because I've forgotten that I just don't really like it here.\n\nFirst, the food.  It's not bad, by any tastes, but it's not brilliant.  I'm a tough judge here because it serves Mexican food and I'm a Californian who grew up on the kind of burritos you dream about when you're away from them for too long.  Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration and kind of makes me sound like a total weirdo but the point is that I have VERY high standards for Mexican food and the Basement has never really reached them.  I do recall ordering nachos here which went down a treat and which I would definitely give another chance if I found myself back here again.\n\nThe atmosphere is what just doesn't really sit with me.  It's dark, usually quite busy which makes getting to the bar a major pain, and generally feels unwelcoming.\n\nI think this is just not my kind of bar - it's somewhere between a pub and a bar, I think, and I'm more of a laid back pub girl.  I don't like to have to fight my way to the bar or yell above the crowds.  I imagine this place would be much better mid week or if you were sure to have a table, but it's just not anywhere I would choose to go.","What a nice surprise The Basement was.\n\nI'm fast beginning to become a regular on Broughton Street for all its awesome bars, restaurants, bistros, pubs and coffee shops (see my Best of Broughton list!) and The Basement only makes this fondness increase.\n\nIt doesn't seem like much on the outside, and inside it's quite homely and not too 'stylish' in any particular way. Warm, darkly lit, and pleasant. Not one for the Ladies Who Lunch or Friday night cocktail drinkers. Instead, it's great for a good meal with friends, an after-work pint or three, somewhere for good food, good chat - yep, it's good!\n\nThe menu changes every day during the week, and at weekends there's more focus on mexican - YES! I love Mexican. Sadly, the boy doesn't. So a few times I've had a craving for a burrito and had to skip the Mexican restaurants. But here there's mexican AND other food. This makes me very happy.\n\nAlthough on this occasion I stuck with the chicken tempura starter, whilst he had the soup. For a starter the portion was very generous! I was quite full after. And the girl next to us ordered bruschetta to start and it was also very hefty. For £4 I felt quite satisfied, and would happily eat one of their starters-instead-of-main again. The mains, however, did look and sound delicious. I'll be back to sample the burritos for sure.\n\nThe only thing, ONLY thing, I don't get - the shirts. Why?! Oversized hawaiian shirts in 80stastic colours. It didn't affect my experience at all, but did puzzle me slightly!\n\nThe waiting themselves were lovely, friendly, and felt genuinely welcoming. Despite the shirts. Props to them.\n\nSo, I really really liked Basement. It lacked all the pretention and pomp of its neighbours on George Street, the food was DAMN tasty, and its on my beloved Broughton. Methinks an afternoon burger followed by a coffee is next on the cards...","Went to this place with a small group of family based on recommendations from Yelp. Was spot on to be honest. The place looks a bit plain, but the food was great and the range of drinks reasonable.\n\nI would recommend this as a good bar to start the night or meet for a drink and some food after work.\n\nWould definitely visit again!","This a great little place to eat. It's underground, but it's now pretty well known, regularly voted as one of Edinburgh's best eats and it's not hard to see why.\n\nThe service is really great - really friendly and chatty but also efficient. And the food was fantastic. I had a spicy pumpkin soup, which was nutty and earthy with hints of chilli and nutmeg. Really tasty. And really cheap too.\n\nThey also do cocktails and bad shirts. But we'll overlook the bad shirts because the rest of it is so great. It is a popular spot, so the restaurant tends to fill up very quickly, but it's a pretty good spot just to go for a drink.","Hidden away under the hustle and bustle of Broughton Street, another of Edinburgh's hidden treasures. It is a bar and restaurant, brilliantly retro and modern at the same time (paradoxically it works), found underground just in the nice area of Leith. The bar is a combination of traditional pub, serving a good range of beers, and then a more trendy wine bar, with some unusual cocktails being proffered. \n\nThe restaurant is great as well, but make sure you book, as it is tiny so fills up really quickly. There is tasty seafood on offer for the starters and the steaks, especially the rump are the best on the menu for the main courses. These come with a nice addition of hand cut herby chips and veg. Again for main courses the fish is also a wise choice, to be honest you won't be disappointed with much on the menu.\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable and they do a lunch menu for £7.95. If you can get past the hideous shirts worn by the waiters then this is an often overlooked gem in the centre of town","It's probably a good thing I don't live massively close to this place, otherwise I'd end up spending far too much money and time here. I'm a sucker for tex-mex food, for starters, and the fact that they sell alcohol too is just an added bonus. This place reminds me of Under The Stairs on the edge of the Grassmarket, but with a more latino feel to it.\n\nThat said, the food here isn't cheap. As cool as this underground bar-eaterie may be, if I'm going to pay just under £10 for a main course I could go to loads of other more upmarket places; for a gatropub-style basement place it does seem a little steep. But, there's always a really nice relaxed atmosphere to this place, thanks to its largely twentysomething clientele, and that's something that you can't guarantee in a lot of other places.\n\nPrices aside, I love this place.","Great hidden gem on Broughton street. Cool without being overly trendy and definately benefitting from its recent refit which added a bit more space without overhauling the look and feel of the bar. The food here is fantastic for the price. try the roast chicken salad. It takes a little longer to prepare but it's well worth the wait. The also do an impressive range of tequilas.","Funky bar where the staff wear loud Hawaiian shirts. It's in a basement (oh, yes) and so it can get very hot in the summer, and it gets extremely busy too, but the service is good. It has a huge brightly painted mural with characters who I guess are based on some of the regulars there.\n\n\n It's pretty central, so if you've a loose couple of hours to spare before going to The Playhouse, it's well worth a visit.","one of my favorite bar/restaurants around- great laid back vibe,good mix of people, and refreshingly not studenty or too many yuppies.\n\n the food is excellent and not too pricey and there is a small, though down the stairs, outside area with heating lamps- for smokers and having a drink outside.  the furniture is cool, service great- many hot bartenders.\n\nloses a star for requiring said bartenders to wear hawaiian shirts","The Basement is brilliant little bar/restaurant situated in (you guessed it...) a basement at the top of Edinburgh's trendy Broughton Street.\n\nThe bar has an extensive range of drinks on offer: wine, beer, spirit and cocktail drinkers are all comfortably catered for. One of the reasons why I rate this place so highly is that it's one of very few bars to have my favourite beer, Bacchus Framboise, on draught. It's a lovely Belgian fruit beer with a subtle taste of raspberries served in an ice cold glass, I can't recommended it enough! If you're feeling in the mood for tequila, ask for a 'donkey' (the bar man will know what you're on about) it comes served with a slice of orange and it's meant to be sipped and enjoyed like a malt whisky, they have been known to be knocked back as well though!\n\nThe restaurant isn't the largest of spaces and the tables are quite close together, however this just adds to the sense of intimacy. The menu comprises of a decent selection of starters/light bites and more substantial mains. Everything is freshly prepared and the food ranges from traditional pub grub with a bit of a twist (merlot and rump pie or Grolsch battered sea bass) to classic Mexican dishes like burritos and nachos. The dessert menu is quite short, but the Banoffee pie is phenomenal and they do a selection of dessert based cocktails.\n\nFood is served from 12pm until 10.30pm, seven days a week and you can book a table via the website.","The Basement Bar is like a schizophrenic restaurateur: it just can't decide what it wants to be.\n\nYou'll find Mexican dishes, pub grub esque steaks, posh eatery style monkfish wrapped in bacon all served in Hawaiian shirt clad waiters.  \n\nSomehow, even amongst this incomprehensible style, the Basement manages to be somewhere you can identify and relate to: it has a particular quirky style and serves decent food to match.\n\nThe mojitos here are great too alongside an admittedly deadly Breakfast Margherita (tequila, grapefruit and marmalade)  and complement an all round enjoyable dining experience. Nothing too pricey here too, a few drinks and a tasty main course should set you back under £17.\n\nYet another Broughton St showpiece."],"business_id":"VHehbRMOnPFVjnNdKGf-qQ","name":"The Basement","categories":["Bars","Mexican","British","Pubs","Nightlife","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Food 3 stars\nFast food \n\nI've had San Francisco Mexican food and this isn't even close to the taste. I's Okay if you want a quick burrito, but stay away if you expect great flavor.","Super B is kinda like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle. The ingredients are higher-quality (like a Chipotle), but it seems more local and is frequented by actual Mexican people (like Roberto's). To add to the authenticity, the menu is in both Spanish and English, and they have Spanish music playing over the radio.\nMy hsuband and I both got the Super Burrito - his in carne asada, mine in chicken, and they were good. The Super Burrito comes with beans, meat, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. The meat was good, but the highlights for me were the fresh, chewy tortilla, and the pinto beans. They tasted like the ones your friend's nana would always be making in the kitchen back in middle school. (if you had friends like mine). Price was around $6.50 for a super burrito and a few chips. Note that despite the name, the burrito is not huge Chipotle size. \nSince they have notices about 'nor-cal's best' and other similar claims on the windows, I thought this might be a transplanted California chain, but best I can tell, Super B is unique to Vegas (don't quote me, my research is not extensive).","The best chile verde and steak!!! The owner is from the Bay Area which is my hometown..and they are the only place with a super burrito (somethn only in Cali that is non-existent here in NV). Very happy with service and food.","I ate here once... Probably won't repeat. \nI think the only thing that keeps this place alive is the fact that there is not many Mexican choices in the neighborhood other than the typical chains.   Reminds me of the old style gas stay ion burritos. I definitely was not impressed. I do not see the place lasting","I was in the neighborhood and looking for a quick bite to eat for lunch. \n\nThe good thing about this place is that they have a drive thru. Definitely a plus. I ordered the pollo verde burrito, minus the beans. The service was fast and my burrito was ready quickly. I liked that it was wrapped in foil, which makes it easier to east on the go.\n\nThe flavors were pretty good. I enjoyed the chile verde quite a bit. The flavors didn't blow me away, but it was tasty. I will definitely be back to try out the other burrito options that are also cheaper. The price added up pretty quickly, so $9 for lunch seemed a little steep. I saw some other burritos priced at just under $5, so I'll probably aim for one of those next time. \n\nDefinitely a good option for a quick bite on the go.","A big plus for this place is that the BF is from San Francisco and this franchise is from the Bay area, so all the wall decor are pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard St. ect... The BF felt proud....Oh Boy.....\nAnyhow, the food I thought was good. I got Steak Quesadilla, the BF got a Super Burrito with rice & we got chips with salsa.\nI hate rice in my burrito but if you want rice they'll put it in you just have to ask.\nThe steak was tender and marinated well & the Flour tortilla was made well. \nThe BF did not care for his burrito much - he thought  they put too little rice. \nNow, the chips and salsa were hellah good!!! The salsa had a great flavor and it was a dry salsa. (I never knew just how much I love my salsa dry ) I'll forever seek out dry salsa's from now on...\nThe chips were hellah good as well - what a perfect crisp crunch and texture. \nThe Green Sauce was salty/tangy good....\nThe inside is spacious and the guy behind the counter was quick.\nAll in all I wouldn't mind coming back- the BF said he'll just try something else next time.\nI will be craving their chips and salsa shortly.....","THE BEST burrito I have ever had in my life. Friendly service and wonderful, that's what I'm talking about. the salsa  verde is to die for.","I love this place, good cheap prices and super tasty food.  I love the little tacos and their quesadilla is fabulous.  Their red salsa is also very good.","Delicious!","Mehhhh.... It wasn't terrible... but soggy beans, bland carne asada and uninspired pico certainly explains why this place is empty every time I drive by. Next time I'm in the area and hungry I'll just drive the extra 2 blocks and go to Del Taco. My search for a good hole in the wall Mexican place will continue on! It's to bad because I wanted to like this place...","I got a carne asada burrito here a while back.  I don't remember much about it.  It couldn't have been too bad or too good then I guess.\n\nThis time around I got carne asada chips and a cheese quesadilla.  The prices were average.\n\nThe carne asada chips had nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese.  I'm not sure if I like that or not.  I was mostly just surprised by it.  The meat was fine.  There wasn't too much beans, which is a good thing.\n\nThe quesadilla was a big disappointment.  For paying nearly $3, I expected it to be about twice as big as it was.  The cheese they used wasn't cheddar, I think it was Monterrey jack.  I like Monterrey Jack, but once again it wasn't what I was expecting.  In any case there wasn't enough cheese anyways.\n\nThey really need to be telling their customers if they are going to do weird things like use nacho cheese or Monterrey jack.  Nobody should have to be surprised.","Almost all the good Mexican restaurants near where we lived have closed over the past 2-3 years so we found ourselves having to drive ever-farther from home to find good burritos. That is, until we saw some poor soul with a yellow Superman-type T-shirt swinging a huge arrow-sign  with \"Super Burrito- Super Good!!!!!\" standing on a sidewalk near this place. We didn't want to encourage that sort of threatening advertising so we didn't go in that day, but once we did get here, we found out it was indeed Super-Good (with one exclamation point at most, though.)\n\nThe menu is short and sweet- burritos! Many different types and sizes to choose from and mix-and-match, from the mini bean-and-cheese to the Super Burrito with guac, rice, pico and your choice of meats (or vegetarian.) We haven't been bold enough to try the tongue burrito, but the chili verde and carnitas are definitely good, as well as the more basic chicken and non-seasoned beef varieties. They also have some enchilada and tamale plates on special but we haven't had those because the burritos are really what you have to go here for. \n\nAs befits a kind of dive-type place, the ingredients are only so-so but put together pretty well once they get in the flour tortillas. The meats are all well-seasoned and the pinto beans are pretty well seasoned too. Chips and salsa is worth it if you are thinking a Super Burrito might not satisfy your hunger, (not sure that would be possible) but you might want to avoid the chips with a nacho cheese sauce which seems to come right out of a can.\n\nThere's plenty of seating if you want to stay, but you would have to be a fan of ranchero or corrida music because the owners (or workers) are big fans of a radio station that plays it pretty much nonstop. In a way, though, that fits the general vibe of the place- a burrito bar transplanted from some more urban place (in this case, San Francisco) and plopped down on the dividing line between Las Vegas and Green Valley. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for pretty good burritos at a fair price, a little out-of-the ordinary and cheesy advertising, Super Burrito is definitely for you.","Here is a little background about San Francisco bay area super burritos.  It is a giant belly bomb with meat, cheese, bean, rice, sour creme, guac, and pico wrapped in a giant tort and then wrapped up in tin foil.  They are all over the bay area.  There basically isn't a taqueria within 100 miles of the bay that if you walked in and asked for a super burrito that wouldn't serve up this delight exactly like this for around 6 bucks.  I have actually carried on La Tapatia burritos multiple times through security at the airport when I come back from visiting home.    \n\nSome of you might be saying, that is no big deal, sounds like chipotle.  Well Mr. Chipotle was working in S.F. and fell in love with these burritos and went back to denver and started up chipotle.  It's true, check it out on wiki if you don't believe me.  Now for me chipotle dozen't really cut it because it's like a watered down corporate version of what a S.F. burrito really is but thats another story.  Imagine a big chipotle burrito but made with the greasy salty food from roberto's and you are close to what it is all about.      \n\nI digress, the owners of this place are from the bay area and they serve up the authentic thing.  If this place was in S.F. it would be a very average burrito place but considering we are in vegas and that this place is pretty legit it hits the spot for sure.  Their burritos are actually a little small for what is normally standard but in reality they are still plenty big enough for all but the biggest gluttons and they are under 6 bucks to boot.  Their 2 locations are the only places in vegas serving these up that I know of (besides chipotle and it's rip offs).  If you know of more help a brother out.   I am going to try their other and way closer location soon but I don't imagine it is any different.\n\nFYI this place for some reason dozen't have rice on their super burrito so if you want the super authentic thing just ask for it and they will put it on, it's better with it IMHO.  \n\nTheir steak is all I have tried and it is quite tasty, it's lean, tender, and flavorful.  They advertise that they use sirloin.  Their chips are pretty awesome too and I overheard someone talking about how they have the best super nachos in the world so it's probably worth a try, they are under 6 bucks too.","Skip it and go to Cafe Rio down the road.  Seats needed cleaning off, it was really hot in there, staff wasn't too friendly, food is REALLY cheap though, chicken burrito was salty, salsa was dry. I don't need to go back.","I grew up eating Chili verde burrito in California. I been driving by this place for awhile now and yesterday I decided to pay a visit. It brought back memories from me growing up and my dad taking me to lunch there. I miss it. Thank you.","All i gotta say is that I'm glad we FINALLY got a good inexpensive mexican spot in this part of town. Ya I've had robertos and that spot is not all that, sorry guys. I tried many different spots around town but to get some good tacos you gotta drive to the north. \n\nI've been coming to this place and a couple of their other locations at least once a week for lunch while at work ( coworkers love the burritos) and maybe twice a week if the wifey is craving some at home. \n\nThe burritos are BOMB! I usually get their supper burrito or tacos. The burrtio is not to big but at the same time jus the right size to eat the whole thing without feeling to overstuffed. Nothing to crazy about the burrito but it just has a lot of flavor, real juicy especially when you get to the bottom. You got the sirloin steak that is real tender with some guacamole, cilantro, sour cream, pico, pinto beans and no rice. The tacos are also good, I've only tried the smaller plain tacos, carne asada with two small tortillas ( i like the way the tortilla has a nice little toast to it) loaded with meat and jus onions and cilantro, just that alone has alot of flavor and it's only costing you a  $1.25.\n\nI hope that this place does good and stays there, cause I've seen a lot of places come and go at that location. The guys at each location are really nice and friendly. I always wondered and asked the guys there tho out of curiosity where in San Francisco are they from since I've never seen a Super B out there, nobody ever seems to know as they are only related to the owner but oh well, that don't matter. I'm jus glad we got a Super B in this part of town.","The worst lunch I've had in Vegas to date. Without question.\n\nThere's a guy standing out front holding a sign saying \"Upgrade your Mexican\" food. After I walked out I had a passing thought that someone should have done the public a favor and tossed a Mexican coke bottle at him to scare him off or something.\n\nI ordered a Super Burrito with chicken, chips and pico with a side of guacamole, and they gave me a small cup of carne asada steak to try. I asked about the Lengua / Tongue on the menu but they guy kept steering me towards the carne asada for some reason. I also ordered some tamarindo to drink. \n\nThe order was made fairly quickly but while I waited I looked around. I'm a little confused by this place. Is it a Mexican place? A San Francisco type place? The whole concept is confusing with Mexican food on the plate and pictures of the Bay Bridge on the wall. \n\nWhen the food was done I snapped a picture of it with the Yelp app. It looked good but that's where things went South in a hurry. The chicken burrito was flat. It's bad when a 7-11 microwave burrito has more taste than this handmade burrito did. And the carne asada steak? They need to go to Fausto's and learn how to make carne asada steak. And the guacamole? Heavy use of the salt shaker made it edible but it lacked flavor even with the heavy salt. How can one mess up guacamole? Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, this place found a way to mess up guac! The only things saving me from leaving with a growling stomach was the pico, the nothing special chips, and the tamarindo which honestly had me wishing I had ordered a Mexican Coke instead. \n\nOn top of that the place just smelled weird. Not a cleaning chemical weird, or a backed up sewer weird, but definitely something was not right in there. \n\nI really regret going there. And while I will give places second chances this was bad enough that I don't think I'll go back. For the money I spent I could have had Chipotle. Super Burrito is like the anti-Chipotle. It's what Chipotle would be like if they did EVERYTHING wrong.\n\n1 Star, but only because Yelp says you gotta leave 'em something.","I'll recap the last minute of my life for you: I polished off my burrito and immediately texted Boyfriend to tell him that we never have to go to Roberto's ever again. This place is that good.\n\nThe restaurant is big and open, with plenty of little tables. It's very clean. \n\nI was greeted when I walked in and was given a minute to look at the menu, without pressure. The menu is small, which I like in a place like this. Granted, I only looked at the burrito options, but this is how it works: they have all the different Mexican food formats (burritos, tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, etc). So you pick your format, then you pick your meat (there are like 8 meats to choose from, which is awesome). The prices are based on the format, not the meat, which is a breath of fresh air. My decision came down to toppings. The Super Burrito has pinto beans, your meat, pico de gallo, sour cream and guac. The regular burrito has just beans, meat and pico. I chose a regular carnitas burrito.\n\nTo. Die. For. This is definitely a quality vs. quantity thing. The burrito isn't huge, but enough to fill you up. The tortilla was warm and pliable and didn't even think about falling apart mid-meal. The beans were..beans. Not much you can do with those. The pico was delicious (heavy on the onion, just like I like it!). The carnitas was killer. Moist meat with crispy bits from the grill. At the bottom of the burrito was my favorite part: that delicious meat/bean/pico soup that collects down there. YUM! As if that was not enough, I sampled both of their hot sauces: the red \"hot\" and the green \"mild\". The hot wasn't \"grab a glass of milk\" hot, more of a smokey, pleasant heat. The green salsa was my favorite! It seems to be a puree of cilantro, onion and maybe some garlic. Like pureed chimichurri...heaven!\n\nSuper friendly, super fast service with really, really tasty food. I couldn't ask for anything more!","I've had better Mexican food in a Bowling Alley Cafe!!\n\nI could go off an on a rant for 7 paragraphs about how bad this place is and why but I will make it very simple for everyone;\n\nGo to Fausto's, it's right down the street and is the best little Taquería in Las Vegas/Henderson by FAR! WAY better quality and quantity for a much better price.\n\np.s. If you have any doubt about my position in this then next time you take your money to SB, go ahead and stand up and watch them make your order. Nuff said...","Been a while since I've ate a burrito. A very unusual adjustment considering that I lived on Mexican food back in LA. But since I'm in Vegas for school, I don't know much about the local joints for tasty food but this came to my attention and it had its share of good reviews, but also disappointing ones. I'm stuck in the middle but I would consider myself slightly disappointed rather. I got the chorizo super burrito for somewhere around six bucks. Not too sure of what the exact price was. But anyway, the burrito was good for a first try. But I don't see myself coming back. There was no condiments and the complimentary hot sauce was no bueno. There was also a bit too much salt in the burrito. If that's what makes up for their taste in a burrito, I'd rather head to taco bell. Save your money and drive down 2 miles south to Fausto's.","Burrito was pretty good. Whoever says these burritos are like the ones in the Mission either haven't been to the Mission or are just liars. The burrito had pico and sour cream but those were the only similarities shared with its Nor-Cal cousin. I like all the SF pics, but the burrito was meager just like all the other burritos in this dessert. I was so stoked too! Bummer.\n\nAnd good price? I paid $7 for a carne asada \"super\" burrito. Not bad, but with no leftovers not cheap either.","First time here. The cashier offers me samples of the green Chile pork. WOW,that meat makes a mean burrito. I will be back!","I'ts Comfort! I'm back once again this time writing on this resturant that is another hidden gem in Las Vegas!!! This was the first time that I had been at this location and I had passed it up a few times because wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was suprised and really enjoyed the cleanliness of this small yet homey resturant.\n\nI was able to taste the meats before I purchased a \"Taco Salad\"that was excellent!!!! (I love taco salad's) so this was a treat for me it had just enough combined fresh igredents that the flavors complemented each other and it wasn't overpowering. \n\nI would recommend the \"Super Burrito\" as well so if you are driving down Eastern Avenue before you get to the freeway underpass on Pebble check out the \"SUPER BURRITO\" you will get your monies worth and leave with a full stomach.\n\nTell em' Comfort sent ya!\n\nSay hello to Henry for me (Manager) He's cool, honest and very courteous!!!","Overall a good place for a quick cheap lunch. Their chorizo breakfast burrito is a awesome and you can beat the price!","I LOVE Super B Burrito! This is what a true Mission District of San Francisco Burrito is supposed to taste like! Super Fresh, Super Delicious! I get a taste of home every time I eat at Super B.","Count your change, and look at your receipt. I had been going regularly, and last week I was hungry, hurried and distracted. Later whenI looked at my receipt I saw I had been clearly shortchanged by the counter-lady. Doubt if I'll return. Or if I do, I'll bring the exact amount. Their burritos are only okay, the ingredients tend to be clumped at one end or the other. Who wants a big wad of guac at the end of the burrito? Anyway, the place reminded me of the cool burrito places I used to go to in SF Mission and I prefer to avoid big chains. Not sure where I'll go now.","My favorite Mexican drive thru! \n\nUpdate! The super soft taco is my new favorite. Amazing! Two corn tortillas overrated with carne asada, Pico de Gallo, and pinto beans. Delicious! \n\nI am in love with the small corn quesadilla with carne asada. They are absolutely delicious. I smother them in green sauce and I'm one happy camper! \nI've tried the tostada... It wasn't as good. The shell got really soggy, maybe I need to eat that first next time. \nI also once accidentally ended up with the flour queasadilla (I think it was there accident, not mine but who's counting) instead of my beloved corn queasadilla. It was good, but I'm sure I'll never swap them out. And going forward Im very careful to expressly make sure they know what kind I want. It's Yummy!","Freshest breakfast burritos and juicy, flavorful, delicious meats. Their carne asada and pork is really tasty. I've tried their tacos, nachos and burritos and have yet to be disappointed. \n\nAlso, the fact that they have a drive thru is such a plus. \n\nGrab a breakfast burrito on a Sunday for a great hangover meal or try their San Francisco burrito (basically a \"California burrito\") - you can't go wrong. I think I like this place so much because you can tell just by looking at their food that it is cooked fresh and with quality ingredients. \n\nSuper B Burrito doesn't serve greasy, cheap canned food that's ready in a couple of seconds or heated in a microwave. It's kind of like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle - not as greasy and heavy as Roberto's with quality ingredients that remind me of Chipotle,, while still maintaining that authentic Mexican taste. \n\nYum! :)","If you like Taco Bell, you'll hate this place because it sells REAL Mexican style burritos.\n\nAlthough they're slightly on the pricey side ($4.99 for a carne asada burrito with a few tortilla chips), theyr'e rather large and tasty.  You can really taste the char and smoke in the meat.... no fake liquid smoke here!\n\nThe regular size burrito is huge in comparison to most other places, I don't think I'd be able to eat the super sie burrito in one sitting.\n\nThey also serve authentic Mexican drinks, everything from Mexican Coke (made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup), to horchata, tamarindo, jamaica, and popular bottled brands.\n\nThe only thing that I think is kind of odd is that the place is decorated with scenes of Sand Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, I guess in order to show off the hometown of the owner.","Consistently makes the best burritos in Vegas. I've driven across town multiple times just to eat here. The carnitas super burrito is amazing","The breakfast burritos are ok but their carne asada and beef tacos are bland. Very tough and chewy meat.  Their green hot sauce is a bit more flavorful than their red (pasty). The green sauce is their saving grace. \n\nI'm only coming here for their breakfast burritos from now on. Eggs, bacon and potatoes in a tortilla.  You can't go wrong with that.\n\nI only use the drive through so I can't comment on the decor, bathroom ect.","Waited in the drive through line for over 20 minutes behind one car. When I got to the cashier, I paid, and had to wait again.... Currently waiting on 3 burritos, all of which are the same. \nHow hard is it to make a burrito when you are a burrito store. \nAbsolutely insane that the worker didn't even apologize. \nNot worth the diarrhea","The place is simple, no fancy shmancy seatings just the perfect local spot to grab good food and enjoy. The wait was a little long but heck i understand, the food is good and plus you only have two hard working guys running the kitchen. Overall, i was satisfied with my San Francisco Burrito and Super Fries... i'll definitely be back","Budgeting is tough.  My wife and I put our play money entitled \"Blow\" down to $100/month, and looking for a good place to eat is a very stressful decision - one that instinctively led to the place where a man held a poorly spelled sign (though I can't for the life of me remember what it was that made me laugh out loud and turn).\n\n\"A good taqueria.\"  Pssht.  I may only be a gringo white boy (though I swear I'm one-eighth Mexican), I know and love Mexican food.  I've frequented the Roberto's, the Cafe Rio's, the Lindo Michocaon's - they've all been pretty good.  (Cafe Rio is bordering on American Mexican, but I digress.)\n\nBut I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for one reason - the meat.  I love the meat.  Their selections are both varied and excellent.  Marinated for hours and clearly seasoned to perfection, I was sold the second they let me test-drive their meats.  Wow.\n\nActually, I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for two reasons - the service.  The people there are friendly and it's clear that they want to do well here.  Smiles and cooperation makes this a solid mexican food joint to at least give a try.\n\nI have a qualm - I have a feeling that they started in San Francisco - mainly because they have the weird decor of the Golden Gate, etc. adorning their walls, but I have to critique the way it's presented.  It's...  awkward.  And I don't know what it has to do with Mexican Food when there's no \"History of Super Burrito\" plaque or something to let me know I'm still, in fact, in Nevada.\n\nHad their nachos and boy were they salty!  But I happen to like really salty nachos, so it worked out.  I've had the burritos.  I've had the taco salad, too, but the burrito is a solid way to start.  If you're not a vegetarian - which should be sacrilege in this restaurant if you ask me - you will love this place.","This was first visit, I ordered the Super Nachos.  I like that they used nacho cheese and not melted shredded cheese.  The prices were very good compared to other places that serve basically the same items.  Service was fast and the food was pretty good.  My only complaint is the nachos seemed to have too much salt.  I am not a big fan of salt so this may not be an issue for other people who like a lot of salt.  Next visit I plan to try one of the burritos.","The best burrito we have ever tried. Staff was soooo friendly what a treat to have something so wonderful and authentic right around the corner. Love love love it.","The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry.  Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . \n\nThat is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  \n\nSuper Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.\n\nIf that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.\n\nEach time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste.","Was looking for somewhere to eat with my bf and saw this place and decided to try it out. My bf loves burritos so it wasn't to hard to sell him on this new place. \n\nI personally loved my super burrito, so fresh and cooked just right. The guac was tasty and the salsa was not overpowering the flavor of the carne asada. I enjoyed the tortilla also, as it was not thick like store bought ones. You got a little side of chips with the burrito and wish I would order more, next time! They where real tortilla chips and not overcooked. Maybe try some nachos?! \n\nFor a drink we both order some horchata. For us it was not very good, it had way to much cinnamon in it which just made it taste unappealing. Next time just go with a fountain drink. Also, that atmosphere was quiet and not very appealing to sit and eat in. I may just stop here on my lunch break and take it to go. \n\nOverall definitely a place to visit more often around work.","Aye Curumba!!! This place brings back the memories.\n\nBack when I was a wee little lad, just started working, we would go and wait in line to get a huge burrito in Millbrae, CA. Home of the original Super Burrito store. I mean, this thing was huge, spicy and we would have to take a nap afterwards!\n\nFast forward to living in LV, I passed by this place several times and did not think it was the same as the California Chain. Then, I saw the signs, read up on this place on yelp and had to give it a shot!\n\n1.  Location - Easy to get in and out of at a strip mall on the northeast corner of Pebble and Eastern.\n\n2.  Ambiance - Clean and simple. Plenty of tables for eat in. You order at the counter. Signs of home sweet home SF and the Bridge! Yeah!\n\n3.  Food - This is a cook to order place, so it is not like all the meat is in a warmer waiting for you, so timing wise, it will take a few minutes.\n\n- Carne Asada Burrito \n- Chicken Burrito\n- Carnitas Burrito\n- Cheese Quesidilla\n\nAll above were pretty awesome. We ordered it as they prepare it, without the rice. Still very tasty.  Now this thing is not power packed like other places. No, it is wrapped nice and tight and has all the right amount of meat and stuff. This makes it easier to eat and to taste the meat.  All the meat was tender and juicy!\n\nWe have been getting used to the huge oversized burritos of late, however, the issue is that they fall apart and it is difficult to eat and enjoy it properly. We end up having to use fork an knife and to me that negates the experience and joy of eating a burrito with your hands!\n\nService was great and very welcoming. \n\nGK says this place is great and I am coming back.","First of all I will start with the positive.  The server/drive-thru attendant was pretty pleasant.  That's it.\n\nThe food itself was awful.  I had a chicken super burrito and the thing was a full step below taco bell.  The chicken was drenched in some sort of creamy goop and I couldn't tell what else was in the burrito.  Totally gross.\n\nGo to Taco Bell if you want crappy mexican food and go here if you want to be even more disappointed. \n\n I have begun to wonder about some of the review I see about this place and others.  Are people really this out of it to think this is 5 star food?  People must have really low standards or maybe just dumb in general.","I love, love love there breakfast Steak burrito, with no beans!  It is very affordable.","Finally, Henderson (or the border with Henderson) has a good taqueria. Super B Burrito brings the simple, fresh and tasty flavors of a classic taqueria to the Vegas suburb.  The guacamole: fresh and oh so good.  The pinto beans: fresh and tasty.  The salsa and hot sauce: fresh and spicy.\n\nSuper B Burrito does the classics right.  A carne asada super burrito (around $5 plus tax) comes with rice and beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese and sour cream.  And it's good.  Real good.  Even the tortilla is well textured and chewy (i.e. not out of the freezer).  You may have noticed a repetition of the word \"fresh\".  It's a simple, but necessary concept for a great burrito.  Super B Burrito understands that and it's a solid taqueria because of it (and in a valley that has suffered so long with the 1-2 day old tastes of Roberto's, it's revolutionary). \n\nBut don't think that Super B Burrito only offers the classics.  If you're a meat eater, this is your place.  They prepare pork, steak and chicken in a variety of manners.  I had the coca-cola fried pork in my burrito and it was tender and sweet, but not over-the-top sugary.  Here's how good that pork is: I always (always) order a carne asada burrito when first testing a taqueria.  But when we stepped into the place, the guy behind the counter found out it was our first time there and started offering samples of the various meats.  The pork in green chile was spicy and delicious.  But there was no challenger to the coca-cola fried pork.  It's what will keep me going back again and again. \n\nUnfortunately, one of the folks that came with us ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was less than stellar.  Super B Burrito basically serves up the super burrito described above without the meat as a vegetarian option.  They do add in some lettuce, but it needs a little more oomph--either the typical fajita veggies or at least a couple different types of beans would help immensely.  Without that you really notice the lack of the meat addition.  \n\nSo four stars for the pork burrito, two stars for the vegetarian.  How did we get back to four stars overall?  The customer service is exemplary.  Friendly, quick and willing to educate the customer on the taqueria's specialties.  The guy who helped us was so awesome that we were sold on supporting the business before tasting the burrito.  I will definitely be back as a repeat customer.  Hopefully, they'll improve their vegetarian burrito and we can bring the vegetarian back again for another try."],"business_id":"VwCYKGji0en-y4ebOXNsnA","name":"Super B Burrito","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["The service here often leaves something to be desired, and if you do take out from ANY of the Serrano's locations, you HAVE to check your order before you leave (different locations have screwed up our to-go orders twice now), but we've found the food to be consistently good.  I love the salsa and the fajitas camerones (shrimp fajitas).  They use Anaheim chiles in their fajitas instead of bell peppers -yum!","Serrano's has been a constant in our lives since the 90's. We have celebrated many birthdays there over the years. Today, was no different. We had good service by Manuel today. He was prompt in getting our drink orders in and didn't hesitate over filling our chip bowl countless times. We had everything from the margaritas,  to the rellenos, chicken enchiladas, and tostadas. All which were very good. Our party of 5 adults and a baby spent 2 hours in our booth over lunch. Complimentary fried ice cream for our birthday kids was delish! The sombrero photos will be cherished forever.","The food is good. The chips and salsa are great. I like the vegetarian options here. I had the green chile tamale with beans and rice. The food comes out hot! The only thing is that the service is super slow! We had a group of 5 people of different ages and races. Everyone liked their food and was satisfied.","We love going here! Food is really yummy, prices are reasonable and atmosphere is fun. The bean dip & salsa is soo good! My husband loves their tacos! I really enjoy the burros! The kids are always happy too which is huge!","I have eaten at this location several times, and it is a goto spot for mexican when we don't feel like heading up to Mesa. The food is good, pretty consistent, maybe not great but always good, especially for the price. \n\nLast night our table had Chicken Fajitas for 2, which I would say were above average. I had a steak taco and chickent tortilla soup (my 2 favs to judge any mexican restaurant). Tortilla soup was very good, steak taco left quite a bit to be desired. I have had this several times before at this location and was always happy, but it was soggy last night.\n\nAs for the complaints below about the bean dip, our family loves it! Ask for some of the extra hot red sauce and mix it with the dip, very good.","Food and service are consistantly good - you have to order your margarita with specific instructions, otherwise you get a glass of sweet & sour.  Some staff appear to be lost or just hanging around but that doesn't affect my dining experience.  However, we always sit in the lounge so we can watch sports on the TV's.  Large outdoor patio is usually busy when we're not 100 degrees.","Mexican franchise type restaurants are usually pretty average.  I don't know on what order of franchise Serrano's is, they have a handfull of locations around the valley.  My test is the kiddo's.  I recently found out that my duaghter likes refried beans ... WHAT!!  And the only reason I found out was because Serrano's serves an awesome refried bean dip with their chips and salsa prior to your meal.  I'm picky when it comes to those too so if I'll eat them they are pretty good.  This location has it's own take out area, similar to chilis, outback and most of the big chain restaurants so you aren't waiting in the mix of all of the other orders, which is nice.  I guess hands down my favorite thing is their peppermint ice cream for dessert.  YUMMY!!","we frequent serranos because #1 it is really the only good family priced restaraunt out here. I do love the chips in salsa but some of my favorites are only ehh there. I do however like the relleno dinner that is what I usually order. I love green corn tamales but theirs are not very good unfortunately. They are very bland and I have never even found a green chili in one. Don't waste your time on the  tortilla soup either. This is awesome if it is made correctly and fresh. Believe it or not the last disappointment was a chicken taco salad. I don' t know how that can be messed up but trust me it can and it was. however I know what to order and on nights we want to go out it is still worth it to not drive far so if you live in queen creek I would go. Go somewhere else if you are wanting drinks. They do not know what a good margarita is there","My wife and I have been coming here for years and have never had any issues with service or food. The food that they serve has always been hot and fresh.","I have been to Serrano's several times and had the same experience each time; ok food and not great service.\n\nEach time I have gone I ordered an appetizer and a main course - the first time the main course came out before the appetizer, once the appetizer came out with the meal and the third time it came out less than a minute before the main course.   I get that things happen, but this is a clear pattern.\n\nThey also committed one of my largest peeves and made us wait for a table when there were a lot of open set tables.  I have heard from others this is standard operating procedure for them.\n\nAt best I would say the food is ok - noting particularly wrong with it, but each time I have been there  - I have left unimpressed by the food.\n\nI am a Mexican food fan and really wanted to like this place (I had heard good things), but in the end bad service and at best ok food - make Serrano's in QC forgettable.","Went tonight, & and although there were still a plethora of Really Bad Parents who expect that we look forward to listening to their ILL BEHAVED HOWLING children, the Magaritas were better.  Not exactly strong, but better.  The real downer? To float a shot of Tequila on top of my margarita would be more expensive than the margarita itself! OMG! Whats the point?  Give A Thirsty Girl A Break!","Okay, went one night about 9pm to grab a margarita! It was terrible, they have some sort of premix that they poured out of an iced tea container. On the rocks... Just unappetizing and sickly sweet. While on the other hand the chicken tacos are always good and Sunday breakfast is good.  Let's not forget the always present distorted symphony of I'll behaved howling children.  God I fear for the future!Ahhh Memories!  Summary : good food, bad margaritas, bring your ear plugs!","I have to admit that despite our close proximity to Mexico, I am typically underwhelmed with Arizona. I had a restaurant I loved in Chandler, but I have moved and it closed. Often when looking for Mexican in the QC I end up at Serrano's. For me, it is always average. Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular. \n\nI arrived tonight to a 20 minute wait. The restaurant appeared to be busy with the list and the number of people in the lobby, but once I was seated and ordered, the food arrived in less than 5 minutes. In fact, I was surprised at how quickly it showed up. I ordered the #23 comb, which is a taco, enchilada and tostada. I wish it were a burrito instead of tostada, but it's not - and even on the \"build your own\" combo section, a burrito wasn't an option.\n\nThe service was very good. My waitress, Ashly,  was prompt, stopped by multiple times (although I only received one drink) and was cute. All good things. The chips and salsa are good and I like the tacos. The enchilada was a cheese enchilada, which is difficult to screw up. The tostada I am not a fan of - it gets a little soggy, has a ton of lettuce and I couldn't really eat it. Instead I skipped it and went back to the chips & salsa. \n\nMy take-away from the experience was a cute waitress, a good taco, nice chips & salsa and quick arrival of food. Negatives for the tostada, the ton of salad and just one drink. Will I be back? Sure - the choices are limited in QC. Will I enjoy it? It's better than Taco Bell, but overall nothing I will get excited about.","Good God, I hate this place.  \n\nWhy do you go, you may ask?\n\nThe answer?  Many of us have them: crazy in-laws.  In-laws who all live in WAY east valley (just call it what it is, PINAL county).  And they ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS pick Serrano's for dinner functions.  It really has been the only place out there for a long while as Christina A. says, but thank goodness more options are arriving, because neither I nor my intestinal tract can take this place any longer.\n\nStart your meal, if you dare, with the baby diarrhea bean dip.  As for anything else on the menu, close your eyes and stab a finger: it is all the same anyway, just different shapes, or layered differently, flat instead of rolled, folded instead of encased... IT DOESN'T MATTER, it barely qualifies as food anyway.  It's not even cheap enough to be worth it.  Ugh.  \n\nSave yourself.  Save your in-laws.  Just say NO to serraNOs.","I like Serranos and am a HUGE FAN - I think they have very good Mexican food, but I have always thought the Queen Creek one could have better customer service, and do a little more to make their facilities more clean.\n\nNothing wrong that I would never eat there again, but I just feel they got to relaxed being the only Mexican Food choice out in QC for so long.  They have competition now, and they need to step it up to keep customers from going elsewhere.\n\nI am a huge fan of their Machaca, but they are not consistent.  Sometimes very hot (almost to hot for this white boy to enjoy) and sometimes not hot enough (in case you were actually looking for a food review - ha)  Everything I have had their has been good - especially if you love tacos.  very yummy - just want them to step it up a little.","Mediocre Mexican food at best, but the chips and salsa are above average.  As many others have stated there are not a lot of options Queen Creek or SE of Queen Creek.  \n\nThis is a suitable family restaurant when driving into Gilbert/Mesa isn't a viable option and you are craving Mexican food.","I love this Serranos!  Every time that we have went here the employees are great, the food is awsome, and the price is right.  We started going here when we first moved to the QC a few years ago, and even though their are more choices out there, we still love our old reliable Serrano's.  I have never had a bad experience here and would reccomend this restaurant to anyone who likes inexpensive authentic mexican food.","Good food good service. Had the chicken quesadilla. This place is kind of hidden but was a nice spot.","Their service is awful (waiters very irresponsible)!!! I have an allergic reaction to onions and I asked if they had any in one of the things I ordered...they told me no that they didn't, but guess what they did! Next thing I know I was covered in a rash....the thing is I asked... they should have been more responsible and made sure!!! Never going back again...I would be careful if I were you!","We thought we had had reservations for 5:15 but when we arrived they had no idea. We had to fit our party of 8 in a booth in the bar. To make a long story short the service was slow! We waited 20 min for drinks. And 40 minutes for our dinner the drink glasses where dirty and the staff shakey at best. The food was ok but overpriced I will never go to Serranos again! Roger R,","Worst restaurant experience of my life! On my friend's birthday, we went to Serrano's because she really wanted Mexican food. I had never been there but she said the food was good. We went with our husbands and her daughter. Basically, this restaurant ruined her birthday. After we were seated, it took nearly ten minutes for our server to even come by our table to take our drink order. Having been there so long, we were also ready to place our dinner order but were not given the chance as she rushed away immediately after asking what we wanted to drink. We had been there a total of 20 minutes before we even got drinks. We placed our dinner orders and it was disaster after disaster from there. After what seemed like forever, our food came out. Well, all except my friend's bean and cheese burro. That came about five minutes later and was cold. Not even lukewarm. Cold. When her food finally came, I was able to tell the server that they had messed up my order. I had asked for my burro to be served enchilada style and it was not. They took it back and threw some sauce on it, but neglected to add cheese. (I had even requested extra cheese on top.) At that time, my friend mentioned her food was cold. It came back 10 minutes later, still cold. Every time the server came by, she would put the food on our table and bolt before we could say anything. She never refilled our drinks. Not once! Even after several requests. After my burro came back with no cheese, it took several minites to flag down another server to tell him we needed to speak with the manager. By this time both my friend and I were seething because she had to send her cold food back again and after sending mine back they still couldn't get it right. The manager came and promised she would make things right. I told her my burro (which had been sitting on the table, untouched, for over ten minutes since they brought it back out) still didn't have cheese on top. My friend told her that her burro came out cold...twice. Instead of taking my burro back to have it fixed, the manager brought out a bowl of microwaved cheese and dumped it on my cold burro. I didn't eat that night. The third time my friend's burro came out (finally warm) she took two bites and was done. She said it tasted like it had gone through the microwave too many times. (Ew!) After that nightmare, and over an hour and a half after being seated, our checks came. They had mixed up items on both checks and the manager \"took care\" of us by refunding us each $3 for our ruined burros that cost $8 and $11 respectively. I was also charged for a side of sour cream that I ordered and never received, despite two requests. We again asked for the manager and told her that was unacceptable and didn't even come close to making it right. We also asked for our checks to be corrected. She brought back our checks with the items corrected and the paltry $3 refund. The manager \"supplemented\" the refund by offering us free ice cream. We had been there forever already, were running way late on our other plans for the evening and did not want ice cream. We declined and stated that we didn't think we should have to pay for our burros because we didn't even get to eat them. She said she'd bring back another check. By this time, my friend's daughter was restless and cranky, so my friend's husband took her out to wait in the car. More than 15 minutes later (!!!) our corrected checks finally came. I was still charged for the \"enchilada style\" and extra cheese for my burro, though we each had the $8 burros removed from our checks. I was still livid to have been charged for extras on an item that I was unable to eat. Unwilling to waste any more time fighting the injustice on my check, we paid and left. After two hours and paying way too much for the experience we just had, we finally left. I will NEVER go back to this place. The service is awful, the manager doesn't care, and is a total cheapskate. Stay far away!","This place is hit or miss but is our goto place for affordable Texmex. They can be slow but they are always nice.","The only reason I end up here is because my in-laws love it. I've been to this place 4 times and I am just trying to get that delicious first taste back from when I first came in to eat. The biggest problem about this place is that it lacks consistency. For instance tonight my soup was cold and my wife got the wrong order. We have only seen the waitress twice tonight. Next time I go could be awesome. It is hit and miss.","We had around 25 people for our daughters graduation party on Saturday 6/15/2013. I have to say Serranos in Queen Creek did an excellent job. They were very attentive to everyone in our party. We had great service with Ivan.  He worked very hard and constantly asked if we needed anything or drinks. There also was a very nice young girl who worked that night who we really liked also, but I didn't get her name. Wish I did. Dan the manager was great. Food was great. It just turned out to be a fantastic evening. Everyone at Serranos went above and beyond to make our evening for our daughter a huge success. I want to tell Serranos in Queen Creek Thank you very much and we will definitely be back.","Want some sort of stringy chewy grey, meatish? looking stuff covered in fake cheesy, oily gravy nastiness with a huge side of gas? .......................Then eat here if you dare.\n\nSerrano's used to be good when they first opened in QC. Oh, for the good old days! They need to seriously redo their recipes........not just make the menu and marketing campaign pretty. EEE  GADS!!!","This place used to be our favorite. But the last 3-4 visits over the last year have been very disappointing.  The service is usually good, but the food has went down.  Also, there are flies all over the place landing in your food and on your drink straws. Disgusting.  Makes you wonder whats in the kitchen. The prices seems to have gone up too and food is mediocre. I wont go back at least to this location.","Love their chips,  salsa and beans they bring to the table when you're seated.  I have never had anything bad,  but my favorite is the Tortilla Soup. It usually has more chicken than I can eat,  but the flavors are wonderful.  They also have the most delicious Tequila Lime cupcakes. ...... To die for.","Bean dip, yummy!  Spinach enchiladas- the only thing I ever order, and I always make everyone else try them- they are that good!\nThe only thing that I suggest is that they get hitching posts, and perhaps a trough....when we ride horses in to the restaurant, we tie up to the light posts.","It has become a family tradition to have dinner here when we drive up from Vail, Az to Visit our family.  Yesterday confirmed that we could never go wrong.  A couple family members ordered their favorites,  like chicken quesidillas or fajitas, but my daughter and I broke with the norm and feasted on the new Del Mar Sampler.  Quite possibly  My all time favorite eat-out dinner.  Paired with the Mango Margherita,  oh my!  Worth driving the 90 some miles just to eat here.","Had dinner here with my wife. She had been to Serranos as a kid so we tried it and it was fine. I had fajitas and they were pretty good. The atmosphere is loud and kids all over the place but thats not the restaurant's fault.","Was in AZ visiting a friend and we had lunch here.  It was pretty good and the fundido sauce/cheese dip is amazing!  The waiter was excellent at following up with my questions regarding vegetarian options, and they have plenty of options to choose from if you are vegetarian, such as black beans rather than refried, spinach enchiladas, cheese quesadillas, cheese enchiladas, and maybe even veggie fajitas if you ask.  I'll eat here again when I go back to visit.","We have frequented this restaurant since 2007. At first it was VERY good.  (Not sure what happened in about 2010/2011 but the food went downhill.  It was always room temp to cool, over salted, inconsistent.  We lost trust in frequenting here and have not been back... until recently.) We noticed they are now closed on Sunday so presumed it was under new management or ownership.  We live in the Villages and decided to give them a go. Well, 3 for 3 visits in the past couple months.   They always & still have good service, good atmosphere, very fair pricing and something for everyone on the menu.  The real test in the end was the food.  We've had the machaca tacos, carne asada burritos, huge side salad when you choose this as a side with your rice.  Food has been consistent, served HOT & was plentiful.  Hopefully they keep up the positive changes.","This is the Mexican food I crave when I am traveling away from home. Chile relleno is great. Homemade bean dip and Jorge is the best most attentive waiter. On Thursdays they have live music that is fun and family friendly. We go at least once a week. True devotees.","the first time i went here was back in january when queen creek was having that week of crazy weather. went there for dinner with my boyfriend and his mom and the place was kinda crowded but we got seated really fast. the mariachi guy was walking around which was very interesting. for some reason it must have been an off night because our food was ok, and the credit card machine was down so all credit/debit transactions had to be ran through by hand.\n\nhowever...i was just there last sunday again with my boyfriend, his mom, and some more of his family and it wasn't that packed yet we prob waited like 45 mins, which i guess isn't too bad, but we were all very hungry. our waitress only came to check on us a few times. the food server guy and the chip guy came to check on us more than she did. but....the food this time was much better!! except for the fact that my boyfriends brother was getting pissed off because he wanted steak and they didnt have steak, then he wanted chicken enchiladas and they were out of the shredded chicken so he wasnt too happy. but the rest of us were! and my boyfriend and i got margaritas and they were good too! definitely will be back for sure!","The chips, salsa, and bean dip was the best part. Service was slow. Mistakes in food order. Shredded beef? Where's the beef? Nachos had maybe 2 spoons of beef. The Beef meal was mainly rice and beans. My dads Pepsi was mainly ice and carbonation. We spent a lot of time correcting the order or reminding them. \n\nI was very confused by the massive amounts of olives on my nachos. One there was more olives than beef, second, WHY THE CRAP ARE THEY ON THERE? Disgusting!!!!","I love this place! Every time I come here, there is no wait, the staff is very friendly and I am always happy with my meal! Our last visit our waiter was very nice and sweet with my little boy and even gave us a coupon code from online to save us a few bucks on our meal! He was very nice and went out of his way to help us, that doesn't happen much these days! My taste buds go bonkers for their jalapeno cream cheese (fendido) sauce! It's cream cheese sauce with a kick of jalapenos, makes any Mexican dish ZING! Whenever I am in the mood for Mexican food, this is the place I think of first! Mmmmmmm delicioso!!!! \n\nThis place is good if you want Mexican food and want to watch the game, for they have a full bar section away from the dining part, or if you and your family or friends would like a nice meal, they have the dining section away from the bar that you can sit at.","Hasn't been the same since they changed their chips over five years ago.   Thought we would give them another shot in Queen Creek.    My Son ordered bean and cheese  burrito. It was served wrong.   Needles to say we sent it back for a reorder.   Came home and my son can't get off the toilet.","I like Serranos but sometimes their food seems a little too pre-made for my tastes. They have good salsa and bean dip and a good selection on the menu. Their veggie enchiladas are good as well as the spinach enchiladas. I like that they have fresh homemade tortillas. They aren't the best tortillas I've had but kudos that they don't use the waxy pre-packaged junk that a lot of places use.","I've had better. That's what she said. No, really, it was ok for a free meal, but the taco salad was pretty grody & I won't order it ever again. The staff gets 5 stars & the food gets 1 star, therefore = 4 stars","Average Mexican restaurant. Margaritas were dreadful, sent them back. Had chicken suiza enchiladas and my husband had chicken fajitas. The chicken was good. Server got several things wrong with our order but was friendly. Nothing special or outstanding about this restaurant.","Love this place for local, easy Mexican. We always ask for Jorge, whose fun and attentive. I'm a lover of chile relleno and their enchiladas. Being a zonie my whole life, I eat Mexican - well, a lot. Each place has it's specialty and for Serranos it's the relleno. It's a little hot, so prepare with a Patron margarita. Or three. Ah, the good life!","first time there in the past year.  used a gift card i got because of poor service last time.  guess what... super slow service again.  good food, but it took so long to come that we filled up on chips.  if it wasn't for the slow service i'd give it 4 stars","Let's get this out of the way first - the food was OK, but just OK.   At best, it gets 2 stars.  Mexican food for gringos.\nWhat was really awful horrible heinous was the service.   The evening started out well enough.  The hostess said the wait for a table would be 15 minutes.  We went to the bar and ordered margaritas (the upgrade from the house one).   Before the bartender finished making the drinks, the hostess came to take us to our table and said she would have our server get the drinks.  We were quickly served chips and dips.\nThis is when things fell apart. \nIt took at least 15 minutes to get the Margaritas.  However, they were really delicious!\nThe waiter did not come back to take our order for another 15 - 20 minutes.  It took at least another 30 minutes to bring the food (soup and an appetizer plate).  During this wait, a different waiter came to take our order and a kitchen person tried to give us the food that belonged to another table.  When we did get our order, it had errors - my husband was given a cup of soup although he ordered a bowl and the guacamole never arrived at all.\nDuring all of these waits, the bus boys continuously asked if we needed anything but seemed powerless to do anything other than bring more chips.  We ordered a second round of drinks and these took even longer to get.  When we did get them, they were not what we ordered.  When the correction was made, they were so tart they were undrinkable.\nOur server apologized profusely because he knew he provided poor service, but honestly, I don't think he was the problem.  He seemed to be stressed and running all the time.  There seems to be a serious lack of organization and training in general.\nI see the reviews for Serranos are mixed.  We know we won't be going back anytime soon."],"business_id":"VzmP95EmSQEKABQmH14_ZA","name":"Serranos Mexican Restaraunts","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I was really craving Mexican, and after reading some of the other reviews concerning this hole in the wall restaurante I had to give it a try. Located right of the Summerlin Pkwy and Buffalo, this little place has a facade of no thrills but oh what a surprise you get. The menu is small but the food you receive is probably one of the best. The place has only a few tables and a bit of a funky smell, like it used to be a chinese take-out or something, but don't let that distract you. After ordering you notice that the service is extremely quick, like McDonald's quick, (I went on a Monday night around 8pm) and the little salsa bar with their different condiments is concise with pico de gallo, fresh cut wedges of limes, a green chile sauce, and a rich red chili sauce. I ordered the carne asada burrito and the five pack soft tacos with carnitas, carne asada, and lengua. All I decided to take them home to enjoy and what a surprise it was. Each and every one of the tacos were still soft and tender. The meats, no matter if it was the asada, carnitas, or lengua, had a slight roasted smoky flavor with a little kick. It didn't take me long to devour all the tacos. Next it was onto the carne asada burrito. All I can say is wow! Same great taste, smoky, juicy, and downright better than many of the other Mexican burrito joints in town. All I could do was nom, nom, nom! It was my first time trying Tacos El Compita numero dos, but it will not be my last!","This place is the most legit Mexican spot in LV that I've found so far. Robertos does not come close. I've had most of the menu and usually go with the chicken or asada tacos and tortas - reminds of the authentic taco shops in frequented in California.","This place makes me want to learn Spanish!\n\nWe had chicken tacos, a beef burrito, and of course some horchata. The salsa bar was fresh and a perfect pairing with our foods. \n\nLucky for us, this place is less than five minutes from our house!","I had bookmarked this place to try quite awhile ago but didn't get around to trying it until a couple of days ago. I ordered three carne asada tacos. When the guy told me the price of less than 4 bucks I thought to myself that I should have ordered another one. I was right. The tacos were small (i.e., think three-bite taco) but tasty. I was disappointed when I first saw them because they had a red sauce on them and I'm a green salsa type of girl. However, the sauce had a nice smoky flavor. Not my favorite tacos ever, but I think I'll give them another try.\n\nThey had a salsa bar with red and green salsa, pico de gallo, radishes, onion, lime, and pickled carrots. I got some of everything. However, I didn't end up eating the salsas because the tacos were already very flavorful. I only got like one piece of carrot because the container was about empty. I don't think the guy at the counter spoke a ton of English because when I told him the carrots were about empty he just smiled and nodded.","I am forgetting the name but the #6 sandwich with meat, cojita cheese and avocado is so good that I got it again within 24 hours of first trying it.","Legit mexican!   Seriously, I love Robertos, but this has something on Robertos, its the same , but better.  I cant put my finger on it, but I know its better, lets think here.....cheap as dirt, quick, flavorful, fresh made to order, glazed meats, mexican workers, bare bones, simple and it makes sense all together.  So simple it is , but remember simple can be supercalafragelistickexpeealodocious.....super for short.   No \"undalay\" over there for a burrito filler!   Satisfied always!  5star mexican!","Another awesome meal!!  My husband and I love this place. The Mulitas are a must try :-). Everything's fresh and authentic. Just Come prepared to pay cash. No Debit or CC accepted. Prices are cheaper than Robertos.","Rather than go to Zaba's for the second time in one week, which my son wanted to do, we hit up Tacos El Compita for some authentic Mexican eats.  It's been a while, so since we've been gone, they have expanded the place.  The night we went, though, it was deserted, but that just meant that we got quicker service.  Three carnitas tacos for me and four chicken tacos for mi hijo to go came to a whopping $9 plus change--much cheaper than Zaba's and muy delicioso.  We need to remember to come here more often.  Muchisimas gracias!","So picture Roberto's. But now take away the inconsistent Carne Asda and the way you feel sick sometimes afterwards, and replace that with an extremely moist, tender Carne Asada and you have a better understanding of Tacos El Compita. I tried it for the first time the other day, and I was very impressed. It is right in my neighborhood so I will definitely return. They also have pretty awesome soft tacos. The taco plate comes with like six and it is all very reasonably priced here. The salsa bar seemed a lot like Roberto's. I was digging the red sauce. Try this place, you most likely won't be disappointed. Make this place 24/7 and open more locations and this place would be perfect. I can't wait to return and try some other stuff.","I'm upset at las Vegas yelpers, ive been let down before, but this was terrible. I had a carne asada burrito, came asada taco, carnita taco, and a cheese quesadilla....I'm happy I only threw away $13","Just wanted to let everyone know that they punched a hole in the wall and now have a much bigger dinning area!\n\nSame great food and prices!!!! \n\nAlso they seem to have cleaned up their act a bit....... tables and rest room are much cleaner.","Best Tacos in Vegas. truthfully, I never get anything else so I don't know... but, I love the Tacos.","Yay! What a good experience. In fact, so good I went back for seconds and am drafting this review while el cocinero prepara mis tacos. \n\nSo I came in to judge a bean burrito. That's it. I figure if a taco shop can't make a decent bean burrito then why trust them with such intricate creations as tacos or tortas (or God forbid, a quesadilla).\n\nIt was good. Real good. And unique. A little smaller than a Berto's bean, and a little looser and with white cheese instead of yellow, but good. The salsa bar is good for a un-gourmet shop. The red and green salsas have tons more flavor than other places, and tons less bacteria aswell thanks to the refrigerated holder. Who would've thought, keeping ready to eat foods at decent temperatures. Shocking!\n\nThe pico is good, and FREE! A little too much onion and the few tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough, but I'm not complaining. Not bad. \n\nThen the tacos came. 1.25 each for choice of meat. I did the Asada and Carnitas, and I'd do it all again, dammit! Little TJ street style tacos with just the right amount of seasoning on the meat. I'm serious, try a bite before you salt it up. \n\nThese went great with the accoutrements. Perfectly paired. \n\nSo for around $5 I had a great, tasty lunch. I might come back for dinner. \n\n...and somewhere off in the sunset, in a dry and dusty land, a chain taco shop is crying because they just lost their best customer- except on $1 chicken taco Wednesdays, por supuesto...","Can't beat their prices, and their food is amazing.\nTheir green salsa was delicious, and all of the condiments were fresh.","Hands down the most amazing carne asada burrito I've ever had! Their marinade or rub for the meat is.sooo good! When they ask you mild or hot ask for the green sauce. Both the red and green sauce are homemade both are delicious but the green sauce is absolutely amazing! Absolutely positively going back for more. I wish they were opened 24 hours!","Best Sopes and Burrito in LV! Best ASADA in town, LA style...closest thing to Cali...Yes! ...found my spot.","My wife and I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on Yelp. We were both raised in SoCal and wanted to try the carne asada. On our first visit we tried a carne asada burrito and had some el pastor and the carnitas tacos. We were surprised that the carne asada burrito was not as good as everyone said. It's not bad but it's just not as good everyone said. The el pastor and the carnitas tacos we had however were fabulous!! \n\nWe went back again today and tried the El Pastor tortas and some more carnitas tacos. Both were unbelievably good! The tortas was the best I've ever had. The food tastes so fresh. The green sauce and condiments are very good. \n\nFinally, the couple that run the place work their butts off and are extremely friendly. \n\nAs good as this place is I am surprised it is not busier. You should go and change that.","People always tell you about \"their favorite Mexican food spot\" and good for them, but what most people don't realize is the best fast food Mexican food west of the Las Vegas strip is in fact Tacos El Compita. This place is clean, fresh and absolutely delicious. Best thing on the menu is their Mulitas, with many choices of meat you're bound to find the one for you, the price is simply amazing as well!! Only down fall is they close at 9pm, most of us like the burritos and tacos after midnight, so be sure to come here for lunch and enjoy the friendly staff as they prepare you some of the greatest Mexican Meals.","Update: The Chile Verde Nachos are probably the best nachos I have ever eaten.\n\nThey. \nAre. \nAmazing! \n\nThoroughly enjoyed every single thing we've had here. \n\nMulitas are awesome and the new menu additions like nachos and sopes frigging rock! The mole poblano enchiladas are a little bit of heaven. Quite a deal at $6.50, too. \n\nCemitas son Muy bueno! A meal and a half right there! Zippy, too!","The burritos aren't 3.99 anymore (it's $6 and change) but it was good! I got the carnitas burrito. The tortilla was toasted to perfection (which I've never had it like that except for when you get a quesadilla) and the inside was very tasty. I also got to try to asada burrito which was given to me by accident. The meat was a but too salty. All in all, Id definitely go back again for the carnitas burrito!","SWEET BABY JESUS!! ORGASMIC!\n\nSo I LOVE tacos and any Mexican food for that matter; they have GREAT food here! The price, quality, and quantity is ace! Everything was seasoned PERFECTLY! I got the muelitas and ordered some carne asada tacos for my son. I went to the salsa bar and was a little hesitant to get salsa (I'm a visual eater and this didnt look yummy) but I got some anyway along with some limes. I went and got my beloved horchata and was in heaven because it was a self serve!! I took one drink and seen cherubs!! It was def love! \n\nWe got home and I salsa and limed up my muelitas and took a bite; I swear the earth stopped for like 5 seconds and I seen angels flying around!! PERFECT! Thank goodness I got the hot salsa because it was delish!!!! The muelita melted in my mouth and I was in love; I couldnt get enough! The carne asada, cheese, and avocado was totally mastered! My sons carne asada tacos were wonderful! We ate all the food up!\n\nThe place is pretty large and just a plain seating area. Remember! Youre going for the food, and not the ambiance!! I've been to super pricey restaurants and the food was hella shitty!\n\nGo here NOW! And bring an extra set of panties bc you may very well cream them!!","My 2nd favorite taco place in Vegas behind Tacos el Gordo.\nBasically, soft tacos cost $1 and you can choose from asada, pastor, carnitas, chicken, and a couple others.  They also make great tortas, quesadillas, and some other things I don't know the name for.  \nGreat salsa bar that has, thank God, pico de gallo.  Most places just have the runny salsas - but I like the chunky pico de gallo.  Adds a lot of crispiness and freshness to any mexican food.\nI also love their burritos - just meat, rice, beans, and salsa.  Highly recommended for cheap eats.","I love Mexican food, but I don't like Mexican food that is overloaded with salt.  In fact, writing this and thinking about my meal a few weeks ago is already making me feel dehydrated.  Perhaps, I ordered the wrong thing.  Perhaps it was a bad batch.  My husband and I shared the Pastor Burrito and after the first bite, the saltiness was too much to bare.  We also ordered a couple of tacos (carne asada and chicken) and those were both OK.  \n\nWe also ordered a chicken quesadilla for my toddler daughter, and once I got past the greasiness (which is to be expected), it was OK too.  The only item I actually enjoyed was the Horchata.  I shall continue my search for a great hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.","4 stars if the place was in Indiana or something, but not with a bunch of excellent competing mexican places in the area.  The tacos were fine but not spectacular. The carne asada was the best out of what I had (carnitas, buche, pastor, and lengua).","Growing up just outside of LA, I know good mexican food. This joint is solid, from the salsa, dollar tacos, to the killer burritos. You just gotta ask for cheese and avocado in yours!","Authentic Rural Mexican Restrooms\n\nThe food was excellent, and I would have given the restaurant five stars for that and for the clean kitchen which is part of the dining area.  However, a dirty and foul-smelling restroom detracted seriously.  Worse, sewer gas dominated the dining area.  The shame of it is that both of these problems are easy to avoid, the restroom by obvious means and the sewer gas problem by making a vent to the outside so the cooking ventilator does not cause undue low pressure in the facility.  OR the gas problem may be solved by simply making sure the floor drain gas traps are filled with water. \n\nIt's a shame and maybe an unusual event.  We'll try it again.","This is what I would consider authentic Mexican taco fare.  Excellent!  I really was sad when my meal was over.  It was so good.  \n\nPaper plates, cash only, very good food.  \n\nTomorrow night we'll be finding another such place to eat.  Not because this wasn't great food, because it was.  Just because this place has got me hooked and I've got to try more.","Location: West side\n\nyuh yeah.\n\nTaco El Compita is like Mexican spots in LA, offsetting appearance, shady business plaza, and smells like chlorine when you enter. Its going to take some guts to jump in and give it a try if you're used to spots like Baja Fresh or Qdoba. Once you're in though, YOU'RE IN... assuming that you like more authentic Mexican food and have no intentions of ordering carne asada fries. \n\nFrom my experience with the carnitas, carne asada , and pollo they are a bit spicy and kind of have a tomato taste. The tacos are tiny, but they are soft, have intense flavor, and only cost 12 pesos (1 USD)! The burrito however is not tiny, you could probably fit a Taco Bell grilled stuffed burrito in it. Anyways my carne asada burrito was filled with rice, beans, onions and well carne asada, none of that sour cream and guacamole nonsense. \n\nThe salsa bar is pretty small, but definitely has all the essentials, pico di gallo, lime wedges, green salsa, and red salsa. Service was quick and prompt.\n\nIf it adds to anything I always see Hispanic customers here, so maybe they think its legit too. \n\nSMALL SMALL SMALL thing that bothers me though is that the menu board facing the cooks and not where the customers are facing.","this place has decent run of the mill mexican food....dont get me wrong- its definetely authentic with the pickled carrots and radish but there is better mexican food out there! i know im biased being from southern california but hey i just have high standards! (and too bad i cant yelp my family's AMAZING homemade food ha!) anywho...still keeping my fingers crossed to find authentic good mexican food in vegas....the search continues....","I had to try this place it out since it falls under my Category of Cherse = Mexican Food! Plus these Yelp reviews lured me in here in no time!!\n\nNot the nicest place nor the biggest but I'm here for the food, besides this is what typical real authentic mexican food shops look like in Los Angeles, so I guess I'm used to it. \n\nCarne Asada Burrito with everything: Not the Best I've tried but definitely one of the better Asadas I've had here in Vegas. The meat had distinct roasted red pepper flavor, had a spicy note to it and was outright Tasty! Pour over some green sauce with squeezes of lemon juice and a couple bites from their sliced radish time to time, seemed to amplify the experience!!\n\nCarne Asada and Carnitas \"Mulita\" Tacos: I don't know what \"Mulita\" means but it costs like 50 cents more and they add cheese (that real white mex. cheese), slice of avocado, pico de gallo.. Whatever, it's damn good!! They place a tortilla on top, forming a sandwich then they lightly fry the tortilla on both sides, just until it gets some crunch and the cheese starts melting.. The Carnitas (pork) was juicy, tender and flavor was on bullseye!\n\nAnd the Blue Ribbon goes to the Carne Asada & Carnitas Mulita Tacos!!","Hubs got the asada tacos I got the pozole. Tacos we're greAt but pozole tasted like they forgot to put seasoning in it. No flavor. I added green Chile from the salsa bar and it was great after that! I've had the pozole here before and it was delicious. Wish they had some specials on tacos. We got the 4 tacos, pozole and a drink snd it came to 17.00 A little pricy for a little hole in the wall Mexican place. We'll be back here.","Hidden behind a gas station in a run down strip mall, Tacos El Compita #2 does not make a strong first impression.  The restaurant itself feels a little run down with a very cramped space and a tiny amount of tables, which appear to only occasionally be wiped down.\n\nGiven all of that, Tacos El Compita #2 requires a leap of faith.  But give the place a chance and you will experience the best carne asada burrito in Las Vegas.  Yes.  The BEST.  Now, I don't give that title out lightly.  There are some good Latin places around this Valley, but this taqueria's cooking out does them all.\n\nWhy?  The secret is how the place cooks the meat for the burrito.  Rather than tossing the steak on a grill as orders come in, Tacos El Compita #2 keeps the steak mixed into a spicy soup.  Kept on a separate stove just below simmering, the steak has been stewing in a delicious, spicy tomato-based soup.  And when the sauce is drained off and the carne asada is placed alongside the rice, beans and cheese, it's over-the-top delicious and spicy and flavorful.  You will have to remind yourself that you're in a taqueria after you start eating because you just don't expect this level of flavor from a small hole in the wall.\n\nSince I moved to Henderson, this place is about 40 minutes away from me.  But it doesn't matter.  We make the drive.  It's just that good.","Thank you Yelp reviews. I've had what were easily the best tacos I've ever had. Delicious flavors and fresh meat. $1 each!!!\n\nBut what do I know about Mexican food; I'm a French-Canadian living in Central PA. Eh?","I stopped here with a friend who was familiar with the place and raved about their carne asada burritos.  The dine-in area is very small, and the few tables were not wiped cleaned.  Since it was a nice day we ordered our food to go and ate at a picnic table at a nearby park.  \n\nAs a sort of appetizer, we ordered a couple of mulitas.  These are kind of like little tortilla sandwiches that have cheese, onion, avocado, salsa, and the meat of your choice.  We got ours with BBQ pork (pastor).  They were awesome and just $1.50 each.\n\nI try to avoid beef as much as possible so I ordered the mole poblano with chicken, which at $7.99 is one of the most expensive items on the menu.  However, when I saw my friend's burrito, it did look appetizing.  So appetizing, in fact, that I had to try a bite. It had been two or three years since I had a carne asada burrito, but I can't say I've ever tasted a better one.\n\nAs for my main dish, the chicken was covered with the mole sauce, and rice and beans were served on the side, along with some slices of fresh avacado.  It had also been awhile since I'd had mole and I was not disappointed.  It hit the spot.  \n\nI know I'll be back here on a pretty regular basis -- whenever I want authentic, delicious Mexican food at a very affordable price. \n\nIt is cash only, so make sure you bring cash.","When it comes to tacos, I don't mess around. I have invested considerable time and effort to become, what I consider, a connoisseur.\n\nIn each city I have lived I have found the best tacos in town, and then become a regular customer. \n\nWhen I moved to Vegas, I was admittedly nervous -- I can't live without good tacos and Vegas is big... it could take months to find the best. Luckily, it didn't. It took two weeks (and 3 great reviews from Latino friends) to find Tacos El Compita. \n\n The food is fresh, authentic, flavorful and juicy! It is just greasy enough to be good  Mexican food, but not so much as to cause post-lunch regret. \n\nI recommend the mulitas, typically with carne asada, or some chicken tacos. (Be warned, the chicken tacos can be a bit spicy if you order them with everything ... but OH SO DELICIOUS).\n\nI went for lunch today, and I'll be back again next week.","This is definitely one of those great hole in the wall places.  Small not to clean but the best Mexican in town.  Yum yum yum don't tell anyone or we'll never get a table.\n\nWe've tried everything and its all good.","Was looking around Yelp for lunch today and saw @Jennifer R's review.....after reading it and the other review of this place, I had to try it out.  I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).\n\nThere are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I no\nticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said \"Sangria\" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's \"non-alcoholic\".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!\n\nWithin a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with \"Everything\", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.\n\nOverall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!\n\nWill I return?  Orale, of course!","Best Mexican food in Vegas!!\n\nI was introduced to Tacos El Compita #2 by a coworker and I have been addicted ever since. Mexican food is usually good if the spot is hood, and this place is no different. It's a hole in the wall but the food is tasty and cheap. They got the BEST carne asada, period. The Pastor is no slouch neither, real flavorful and saucy. I always get the 5 tacos for $5.25 and a Mexican Coke. They also got mulitas which are like open face tacos but they add cheese and another tortilla on top with avocado. You won't find that anywhere else around here.\n\nI would probably eat here everyday if it was closer to my house. It's that good and I LOVE me some mexican food! Damn my mouth watering just thinkin bout it!","Ay Dios mio!  This place is good!!!\n\nThis is the second outlet of the original Tacos El Compita on Charleston and Jones  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-compita-las-vegas)\n\nThe food is just as authentic and good as the original.  It is much smaller then the original with less seats so if you go during lunch or dinner rush you may have to wait for a seat.  That contributed to the half-star deduction as well as the fact they do not have aguas frescas or fresh jalapenos both of which they have at the original location.\n\nI think the tripas are my fav here.  But everything else is so good - the carnitas, buche, lengua are all excellent.\n\nI want to try the caldos here, someone next to us had some menudo that looked really good.  \n\nI tried the cemitas and am not a huge fan because I didn't love the bread.  and unfortunately I believe it's the same bread for the tortas, but I'll have to try next time."],"business_id":"XWgsRwCgUfd5xDdNwGyMTA","name":"Tacos El Compita #2","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Ah, Pasqual's.  This is THE place where my best girlies and I go for our weeknight, post-school decompression sessions.  Why?  Well, the food is pretty good (fresher ingredients and less greasy than most of the Mexican restaurants in Madison), and the margaritas are dangerously strong and yummy.  The service is fast, and if you order a basket of chips and queso, they'll perfectly tide you over while you wait for your entree to arrive.\n\nThe Monroe Street location of Pasqual's also has a great atmosphere (that, in my opinion, is not replicated in the Hilldale location).  Noisy and social, with a nice combination of small, two- or four-person tables and bigger communal tables.  It just feels like a friendly, neighborhood place.  And the din in the main dining room has always been great enough to drown out any loud shrieks of laughter or shock that emanate from my own table as we relive the pleasures and horrors of scholarship at UW.","Overall, I really  like Pasqual's. First of all, my old man and I went to New Mexico on our honeymoon, so anytime I see green and red chile on a menu, I always order it. It's nostalgic. :)\n\nI also  like that Pasqual's is laid back, affordable, and makes hella strong margaritas. (really, they'll knock you on your ass, so be careful)\n\nThe Monroe Street location is warm and inviting. The food is great and I appreciate the option to have smaller portion sizes. I like that I can get a filling meal for only 7 or 8 bucks. Combine that with half-price Margaritas on Tuesdays, and you have one happy (and drunk) Elise M.\n\nI don't like that Pasqual's charges for chips and salsa. It's always bugged me! I could understand charging after the first basket or something, but the fact that they make you pay when all other Mexican restaurants in town don't, is kind of lame. Also, some of the items on the menu are bad. For example, one time I had the black bean soup and it literally tasted like partially blended canned black beans. No flavor. Lacked salt. Gross. Another time, I had something with pulled pork that I didn't really like. However, most times I think the food is pretty tasty and it seems fresher than the fare most other Mexican joints in town. My go-to order at the Monroe Street branch is the chicken tamale with green chile sauce. I get the black beans and rice on the side. It's nummy!\n\nNOTE: I've been to the Hilldale location 10 plus times in the past 5 years, but I never **really** liked Pasqual's until I tried the Monroe St. location only recently. The Hilldale one is loud and echos a lot. It always feels cold, and I seriously think the food is not as good. I actually used to somewhat dislike Pasqual's until I went to the Monroe St one. So, if you've only been to Hilldale and not been impressed, then give Monroe St. a try before writing it off completely.","Fast, reasonably priced. Not particularly stand out. You should really just go to Taqueria Guadelajara, but barring that...\n\nBottles of Sprecher's available for purchase (usually get a cream soda). My friends like their margaritas, Their rice and bean sides don't really do it for me, but if friends want to go I know I'll always enjoy a half order of the nachos  (which is plenty for me) with red chili pork.","Pasqual's is an all-around average experience that will disappoint only in regards to the fact that it resoundingly fails to impress on any level. I am not a fan of their tacos or burritos, but nothing I have had here could be described as \"bad.\" The ultra-Americanized unoriginality of Pasqual's Mexican food is rivaled only by The Taco Shop.\n\nI keeep coming back to it because the nachos are really where it's at. They're incredibly crunchy and flavorful with a decent seasoning, reminding me of the now-forgotten tortilla chip kings of Taco Heaven. Heaping portions of cheese, beans/meat, and veggies make this dish into a paragon of Mexican fast food.","I'm not a lover of their food, but the neighborhood location and two-for-one margaritas make up for it. Sort of. They have two good things on their menu, IMO: the nachos and one of their beef burritos.  \n\nAll in all, I'd rather drive a little further and get some authentic Mexican from Laredo's at half the price.","Back when this place was in Minneapolis, I was a cook there.  We had fresh great recipes and it was \"new\" - quality mexican food before Qdoba's and all the big chains were around.  The food was fresh, lots of good flavor and unique beverages and treats.  Well...Pasqual's ended up in Madison and, it's just as good as I remember from when I worked there.  We go for work lunches.","Ugggh.  That should be enough for this review but I'll explain a little more.  This place just sucks.  The food is mediocre and I'd rather eat taco bell for the price.  Why does everyone go gah gah over crappy texmex?  Oh it must be the margaritas, cause alcohol makes every taste perfect.  I will never waste another night trying to stomach this crap.","\"If you were falling, then I would catch you. You need a light, I'd find a match. Cuz I love the way you say good morning. And you take me the way I am...\"\n\nThis perfect little song was playing in Pasqual's as I walked in for the first time about two months ago on a Wednesday afternoon. I had just received some really, really good news from my doctor and although everyone else was at work, I had to celebrate. Margaritas at noon? Why not? The woman at the counter was extremely helpful and friendly as I perused the menu to find the best celebratory lunch. A chronic un-decider, I finally settled on two enchiladas: one chicken, one beef, one with red chile and one with green chile. Done and done!\n\n\"If you are chilly, here take my sweater. Your head is aching, I'll make it better. Cuz I love the way you call me baby. And you take me the way I am...\"\n\nI found a great spot by the window, surrounded by healthy succulents and cacti, a howling coyote sculpture and an armadillo carving. I waited patiently with my pink plastic mum--this notifies the food runners where to deliver the orders. The margarita was completely fresh and well-balanced. Somehow, in my cozy lunch euphoria, I devoured the whole plate of enchiladas with beans and rice. I finally had my appetite back, and what a great place to replenish my food credits!\n\nThanks Pasqual's! You fed my heart AND my belly.","I've been going to Pasqual's for the past 15+ years.  First the one on Monroe, then they briefly had one on University Dr. in Middleton, and I have also eaten at the one in Verona, the old one on Atwood, and the one in Hilldale.  Growing up, we went to Pasqual's as a family every Friday for dinner.  I even worked at Pasqual's when I was 14.  Worked there a day, then they realized I was 14 and underage to work there, so I was let go.  My point is, I know Pasqual's really well.\n\nIt's delicious Tex-mex.  It's not trying to be Mexican, and it isn't.  The ingredients are fresh, it's not greasy, very quality food at very cheap prices.  Some of my favorites: chicken enchiladas with red sauce.  I have had the green sauce and the mole, and the red is still my favorite.  Get it will blue corn tortilla.  I usually order the \"single dinner\" and get it with black beans and pinto beans, no rice.  It's a big serving of food, and if I can't stop eating it and finish the whole plate, I'm in major pain.  I also enjoy the Jerk Chicken burrito (a la carte, the burritos are huge).  The taco salad is decent, not super amazing, and the nachos do not hit the spot like nachos should.  Get a basket of chips w/ salsa and guac when you first order.  Your dinner will be ready before you even finish the chips.  The salsas are so good, and you can buy them at Woodman's..  The margs are amazing: not too sweet, not too sour, and very strong.  \n\nPasqual's is very casual, kinda laid-back, very \"Madison.\"  Every time I'm in town, I always go back!","Delicious Tex-Mex on a fun street.  Right next to a lovely park along Lake wingra.","Met my bf and his parents at Pascuale's for dinner on Friday evening.  If you're not from Madison and have never been to Pascuale's before, the lack of signage indicating if you should hop a sit at an available table or wait in line-should you encounter one, was a little confusing.  Despite the 2 minute aimless walk-around while we figured it out, we took a seat and then went up to the counter to order our food.  The delivery was prompt, with each entrée enclosed and delivered with a cover to ensure the arrival of warm food.  I ordered the chicken fajita taco dinner which was good, but not worth elaborating on.  How can you mess up a chicken dish anyways????  To wash it all down, I had one of their \"known-for\" margaritas, but may I suggest to anyone or everyone else, please deviate from the orange-flavored margarita.  Orange flavor needs to stick with cough drops and screwdrivers.   \n\nWhen it's all said and done, go outside, step to the crosswalk and participate in the crosswalk flag system and cross on over the Michaels's Frozen Custard for a root beer float.","Ahhh, this brings back memories or walking down to lunch from High School.   We swung into Pasquals for lunch and while it was not as good as I remembered it was still delicious.  \n\nI got the good old Taco Dinner with shredded beef and I love shredded beef taco especially at Pasquals.  Honestly, I cannot say anything bad about our lunch at Pasquals except it was good food (still not he best but very good).   I also loved the Nachos that had mass amounts of cheese melted to perfection.  When you get Nachos and do not have naked chips left over is always a plus.","I'm a fan! I had the fish tacos. He had two enchiladas. Delicious entrees and sides. Too bad I didn't bring my id so I couldn't try the margaritas. The food was hot and delicious! We will definitely return.","This place is mediocre at best.  I've been to both locations (Monroe and Hilldale) a combined 3 times and everything I've tried is just.... blahh.\n\nTo be fair, I only order burritos.  I've tried a few now and they are just so dang bland.  Tonight's order, a chicken burrito, came with meat, a little quacamole, and some onions.  WTF?\n\nFor $7.50 or more, you should be able to get a tasty, properly seasoned burrito.  The best burritos in the world cost about $6-7 at taquerias in the mission district of SF.  I'd rather pay less for a far superior burrito from Chipotle, Qdoba, or even Taco Bell (at least save money).","The food here is decent. I think it was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Madison. If I ever stumble through Wisconsin again, I'll have to give it a try.","I was so disappointed.  I have loved the Pasqual's at Hilldale Mall for years, but this was a reheated, poor quality, experience.  Had fish tacos and the fish tasted very old.  The rice was reheated and had chunks of old rice in it (c'mon how hard is it to make fresh rice each day?).","solid tex mex faire. nothing too fancy, just decent food at a reasonable price. \n\nthough, i will give an little extra credit for a fantastic salsa. it has a mild grilled veggie flavor to it that compliments their food really well. \n\ni can't say much for the dining experience since we opted for take-out to watch a movie at home, but it seems like everyone there was pretty pleased and the staff seemed on-top of things well we waited for our order. \n\nnext time i'm passing through town, i may just stop in for the whole experience.","Loved this place! I am from out of town - here for our son's graduation from UW Madison grad school - and, as a native of New Mexico and a student of Mexican food throughout the US, I can enthusiastically recommend Pascual's. Nothing fancy, but good nonetheless. This is a fast food place - think Qdoba or the like - but service, price, and food are all well above average. Very busy tonight by the way, which seems in opposition to the so- so Yelp ratings. Try it!","Delicious, fresh, simple Tex-Mex, Mexican food.  Don't confuse this kind of Tex-Mex with Pedros -- think a fresher mom & pop Qdoba. The brunch is DELICIOUS I dream about the guacamole.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.","We have been to Pasquale's 3 times in 10 days. \nFirst time I had the fajitas burrito and it was fantastic, Second time I got the tostado.Which was ok., yesterday We went back to have lunch and I got the fajitas burrito again hoping it would be just as good. It was ok\nOverfilled, onions weren't cooked enough as were the pepper's , Needed to be recognizes more.\n\nGranted they were busy and training new people so that pay have been a problem. We will definitely  come back.\nDon't overlook the regulars","Even though this isn't the most authentic mexican food, it's still my favorite in Madison.  It's fast and cheap, and pretty flavorful.  I really like their tamales.\n\nMy only problem with it is, for some reason, it's always cold in there, and my food is always a tad on the cool side.\n\nI miss the Atwood Ave. location, and hate hate hate the new hilldale location.   The atmosphere there is hideous, and mcdonalds-y, even though it's sit-down.","Been a fan of Pasqual's for almost 20 years. I last ate here when they were still across the street from Michael's up the way. It's nice to see the food hasn't lost a step and is still a lighter and fresher take on American Mexican fare. I miss the free parking, the slightly more cozy atmosphere, the ala carte options, and the more price-friendly counter service of the old place, but I'm glad the basics are still in place at the new location. Hopefully they'll continue to keep me as a fan for the next 20 years.","Here I am, sitting at a table with my buddy at this location, writing this review because we are bored. It is 6p on Sunday, and this is the worst service that we've had in a long time! I only see two waitress in the whole place (one is the bartender), and we need refills. By the way, they don't have ground beef? \n\nIt's now been 1 hour since we ordered, and nothing. \n\nFinally got our food. Nothing special. Expected better! Took forever for our bill. We won't be coming back anytime soon.","I'm not one to write reviews, I figure if I frequent enough it should always be the same or maybe better, not in this case.  I have been to both Hilldale and Monroe many times and usually always have the Huevos Racheros, and every time I get the same response to my asking for poached eggs, \"we don't make poached eggs here.\"  \n\n I don't have a problem if it's not listed on the menu * eggs made the way you like them*  Now, it's usually a hit or miss depending on the server, but this time just rubbed me the wrong way, and the way our server said, well you may have gotten them at another location but we don't serve poached eggs, we only have a grill here.\"  What, a kitchen doesn't have pots for boiling water?  \n\nThe food was great, service was lousy, and inconsistent, and if you put a statement on your menu ALL your locations should follow suit.","The only good thing about this dining experience was the actual taco. The rest of the food was blah, including my cocktail (beans, rice, chips, dip)\nThe restaurant wasn't full, but was so loud that it was hard to have a conversation. Our waiter wasn't very friendly or forthcoming with service (we had to ask for water and then leave the money on the table because he was busy talking to coworkers)\nI picked Pasqual's because it seems to be a favorite of a lot of Madisonians but I can't figure out why. I wouldn't recommend it!","Not my cup of tea. I got the guacamole burrito, which, albeit is probably not their specialty, was a wrap with lettuce, tomatoes, and gobs of guac. I'm an avocado fiend but this was sorta the pits (see what I did there?). Not big on flavor.","While I prefer the Monroe Pasqual's to the one at Hilldale, it's still just OK. \n\nMaybe it's irrational but I just can't get over having to pay for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa comes in a tiny to-go container. I mean if I have to pay $3 for what is normally free, it should at least come in a decorative bowl, right?\n\nThe burritos were all right. I got the commuter so I could try two smaller burritos (they were still huge). I'd recommend getting the \"cowboy\" burrito so you can get some chili sauce on top. It gives the somewhat bland food a bit of a kick. \n\nI agree with some of the other reviewers that counter service would be a better value here than table service. I'm not sure we'll go back - but it was worth trying.","Tried the location at Hilldale awhile ago, way better than this place. Came in on a Sunday for brunch, started off ordering a bloody mary which had to be made with their garlic infused tequila because they were out of vodka (what?). The menu described the $8 drink as garnished with lots of toppings, when I got it, it had a lemon and lime. I took one sip and discovered tequila is not meant for bloodies, so I asked for a coke in return. We were told we wouldn't be charged for the bloody, but once the check came and the $8 for it was still included, our server told us it couldn't be removed from the bill because it had been made, but to take it off of his tip (again, what?).\n\nFood was decent, but my order was messed up and I was already feeling too needy to have it sent back. Also a bit pricey - chips and salsa aren't included with meals. I would not go back to this location.","We met some very old friends at this restaurant a few weeks ago for lunch and had such a wonderful time - staying for well over 2 hours - never feeling rushed or pressured to leave.  The food was ridiculously good and so well priced.  Our server, Mark, was all smiles, friendly, and exceptionally attentive.  The decor and atmosphere was so authentic and relaxing we did not want to leave.  After arriving home to Chicago, we realized we left a very special gift on the table.  When I contacted the Pasqual's, Benjamin Roberts was quick to assure me that they had the gift I left behind, and Mark  very carefully wrapped it up and mailed it to me. I really felt that these guys have a \"we care about our customers\" attitude.  Our son is a Freshman at UW Madison so we will certainly be back!  Can't say enough about how good the food, service and value is at this outstanding restaurant.","Love the margaritas.\n\nThe food is very inconsistent.  Several times when I ordered the chicken fajita burrito, there was barely any chicken.  Very disappointing.  The Monroe Street location used to have a huge problem with consistency of the food at the old location, but cleaned up their act at some point.  It seems that the same problem is back now.\n\nThe prices have gone up a lot in recent years. Not much of a value for the food that is served.  A dinner for two with margaritas will top out around $50.  Seems a bit high for average tex-mex.\n\nI hope Pasqual's can step it up a bit.  It's a nice tradition for the Monroe St. neighborhood.  Would hate to see it disappear!","We like Mexican food - most of it is vegan and we both like that, so we thought we'd try something new and do Pasqual's on Monroe.  Very disappointed!  First of all, the place was not even half full on a busy restaurant night, not a good sign.  The bathroom was disgusting - the toilet seat was actually sticky - yuck!  and messy - like I said in other reviews - if the bathroom isn't clean, you can bet the kitchen isn't either.  There was a loud bunch of drunk college kids at one end and loud music so the noise level was way uncomfortable.  The salsa/chips were good and food OK, but I had an upset tummy the next day.  Service was adequate.  I noticed lots of moms/dads/kids in there also.  The decor was nice.  But we'd never go back and would not recommend it. The one good thing was it was cheap","Okay, it's all good...not the best but not the worst. I've lived in California, so I'm going to take this moment to be a snobby baby about my Mexican food.\nThe tortillas are good!\nAlso, try the blue corn pancakes with pine nuts and orange syrup!! \n\nGreat ambiance, bring your kids.","Dunno what people are beefing about.Best SW Mex food in town, tasty,delicious guacamole, wonderful extra-hot salsa, and a variety of meat and veggie dishes--and a more than ample dinner for two for twenty bucks--a great food buy. Service was pleasant and efficient, nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend if you're around the Monroe St. area.","The main thing that needs to be said: this place naming itself after the famous Pasqual's cafe in Santa Fe is a hideous joke, and probably legally actionable.  The food at these two Madison stores is bland, dry and generic, and does not even vaguely resemble even the most mediocre New Mexican food available in NM and CO, not only in quality and taste, but in basic style.  \n\nIn fact, the green chile burritos wrapped in foil in the hot cases at virtually any convenience store down there are a large cut above this.  It's hard to call this food even a poor imitation of New Mexican food in general, much less the world-renowned creations of the chef at the real Pasqual's.  Boo!  \n\nIf you even remotely like this, or any other so-called Mexican food available in Madison, do yourself a favor and buy a cheap plane ticket to Albuquerque... you may not even make the return trip.","I travel frequently for office work and I like to try local restaurants as much as I can.\n\nWas driving around monroe street and got into this one for dinner. Thanks to the catchy sign board. \n\nIt has a typical but nice ambience of mexican bar. I was accompanied by my Boss who is Belgian and likes mexican cuisine. Were served by a cute and helpful girl.\n\nA bit disappointment on food taste. My plate looked really nice but did not taste very well. Drinks were really nice though. One of the best Shangria I ever had!","So sad to rate Pasqual's this low...but you get two stars for proximity to our house and 1/2 priced margaritas.\n\nWhile adding table service is quite nice and convenient with the kids, the service and quality have not improved as it should with a sit-down restaurant.  The food continues to be pretty inconsistent and is most noticed in your soups.  One day it's thick like stew and the next it's watered down.  Yes, I order it enough to notice.  Please stop serving \"old\" looking guacamole in the plastic cups!  In fact, get rid of the plastic cups for the salsa too.  Looks tacky at a sit-down place.  Also, bringing our food out on plates with hospital cafeteria covers does not whet my appetite.  I'm left wondering, how long has my food been sitting around steaming while we're chowing down on chips/salsa and ordering our second margarita.  Lastly, how can you possibly charge $1 more on kids meal for ordering fries!  You hardly give the kids any food as it is!  We never even get offered the kids drink that supposedly comes along with the meal.  Seriously, I'm starting to feel ripped off!   \n\n\nFinal test, does management from Pasqual's even read their reviews?!","Awful.   Ordered enchiladas.   Tortillas not properly prepared.   Bland, dry filling.   Sauce lacked seasoning and good flavor.  What a sad enchilada sauce.   Beans were bland and should have been refritos, but were not.   Cardboard seems more appealing.","Good food.   Good service.   chicken quesadilla  is made very well. One of the best I've had.   Chicken was moist, not dry.  Tortilla was unique, crispy and flaky.   Tasted really good.","Had lunch on 2/17/12. Was one of the best experiences in a while. The new location is very nice, plenty of seating. Service was quick and very good. We ordered a veggie taco, nachos, and a beef enchilada. Good portions, well made, and hot. The ingredients was fresh not from a bag. The black beans were cooked and not spooned out of a can, like so many restaurants. All three choices were well done. We will be back again soon!","This restaurant is a staple for the Madison west-siders.  It's nestled among all the cute-ass shops on Monroe, reasonably priced, and extremely tasty.  The annoying things about it are the stupid flags for crossing the street outside and the fact that my cell phone mysteriously doesn't get reception in the place.  However, the chili cheese dip and speedy service far make up for it.","Good \"Mexican\" food.  Fast.  Cheap.  A great place for lunch or a quick dinner.  The breakfast, though tasty, has a pretty small menu.","As far as Madison's Mexican food scene, this place is pretty good. The salsa and chips were unremarkable but the Anasazi burrito I ordered was tasty (certainly a step up from the La Bambas and Taco Bells of the world). My main complaint would be the price, which was a little excessive. They have more options than a chipotle, but the burrito was fairly similar to Chipotle quality, except that it cost basically two dollars more. I'm not sure the extra money is worth it if you're just going to order a dry burrito.","I've been a fan of Pasqual's burritos for years, and I always hit this place up when I'm back in town.  The chicken half commuter (half a burrito=perfect lunch size!) is my staple, and they're always very good about not putting the beans in it like I ask for.  They recently moved to a new location on Monroe which is smaller than the original, but the space is very well-decorated.  Don't waste your time with the yuppified Hilldale version--the Monroe St location is where it's at!"],"business_id":"XsDFvUcFxnOEOw9zKvO-iA","name":"Pasqual's","categories":["Mexican","Tex-Mex","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Husband and I moved to Wisconsin from Southern California, land of hand-made tortillas and bombity-bomb mexican, and have been looking for non-gringo mexican for the last month.  It's been a hard, painful, sour cream-filled road.  Up to Habanero's, the closest we'd found to the real thing was el Mariachi in Lake Mills (really good, and more capable of making the spice sweat-worthy, but unless you specify they will default to the bland side).\n\nFinally, a restaurant where the place was packed but we were the only gringos.  Fast service, killer portions (beat out our old standby in LA with the taco meat portions), and the flavor that we've been craving.  Get one each of barbacoa, steak and pastor, your taste buds will thank me.\n\nNot sure about the 3am rumor though, we wanted a second round after getting out of the Barrymore at 1am, and they were closed.  Still, if you're craving the food and wanting seconds the same day, that's a definite good sign.","I know there's no rule book somewhere that says Mexican food ought to be cheap and fast, but I feel like it's a given considering the ingredients... right? Add to my wild assumption living in the southwest for 6 and half years and I grew to learn that if I was going out for Mexican, it wasn't going to be a long dinner experience and I wouldn't have to shell out a lot of bucks. Haberno's holds true on both accounts. They're quick (as you essentially watch them assemble food before your eyes) they're cheap, a five spot will buy you lunch, but in my opinion they lack flavor. I'm all for loading up some tacos with salsa, but I also think meat should be seasoned so you don't need to dredge everything in pureed tomato. I'm up for giving them another shot, but others in town bring the flavor these guys lack.","The burritos are as big as your head, weigh as much as your head and are only about $5-$6.  Fresh, quality and really good.","I am a HUGE fan of this place! So, let's just say this place is not fancy.  It is tacos and burritos and the prices are great.  Honestly, it is hard to find a simple, traditional taco in Madison. This place satisfies all those needs. \n\nThe location is strange. It is in a strip mall on Stoughton. Kind of annoying to get to, BUT they are open SEVEN days a week. They are pretty quick and like I said the food is delicious and affordable.","Best tacos in Madison. Hands down.  It's a shame it's not that close to downtown (or the westside), or this place would rake it in.\n\nService is Qdoba/Chipotle style.  Other than the meat you ordered, there's no limit to what these guys will throw on the burrito/taco/etc.  Ask for a little, you get more than normal (no joke - be wary).  While 2 bucks per taco (6 for a burrito) might seem over the top at first, you'll find yourself full after just a few.\n\nThe food itself is delicious, spice is good, and it's a mess. Everything you'll grow to love.  Try the barbacoa, it's been simmering for 24+ hours by the time you get it.  The stuff melts.\n\nThe flatscreens with the spanish music videos seal the deal. You'll never go anywhere else again.","I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. \n\nBy far the best authentic Mexican Grill in Madison that I have tasted. Plus you get a stamp card. Once your buy your 10th entree, your 11th is FREE! \n\nJust amazing simple food. Tacos, burritos, fajitas, etc. Nothing too fansy but that is what makes it great. They are just doing the basics but it's done so well. \n\nI go there at least once a month. \n\nTry them out. SOOO worth it and the $$ are EXCELLENT!","Awesome!   Great fresh food, cheap, friendly staff.  The pickled onions with habanero's will make your eyes water in the best possible way.","So where can I find a taco in Madison that I can be proud to say is amazing....Habanero's!\nSo to get started---a little hard to find. I have been driving past the location every day to and from work never noticing it next to the Pool/Spa store on Stoughton Rd. Silly me. \nI finally took the chance after seeing the great neon lights in the window and stopped in. \nYou first order at the counter, and they have their operation set up like a \"build as you go\". \nThe choices are limited, but all the essentials (Taco, burrito, torta, or quesadilla). I suggest either the steak or chicken but you can also get barbacoa or carnitas. The tacos (if orders in corn) come in 2 shells each taco ordered. \nAfter ordering then you and sent around the corner and you get to pick what you want on them. \nPico, corn, sour cream, great Mexican cheese, lettuce, guacamole, and a fine selection of salsas. \nIt's quick & convenient with ample seating. \nAlso, a fine selection of drinks and beers. What is not to love! \nI recently went against my current taco order and had a burrito....huge! It was also a great choice. \nIf you order the extra meat for $2, you will be very happy. They pile it on, no matter what meat you decide to select.  Heck yes!\nGreat pricing too. \n3 tacos-$5.99\n1 Burrito-$5.99 (cheaper and better than the other chain \"build as you order\" burrito joints)","Best tacos in town!\n\nAs was mentioned, it's setup Qdoba/Chipotle style. Quasi-cafeteria, semi fast-food. Service is quick.\n\nThat's no knock however, because the food is amazing. I've only had tacos, but I have tried all the different meats available. All are well seasoned and spiced, and you get huge portions of meat.\n\nMy advice? Get your tacos w/ only onions, cilantro, and the habanero sauce. Your tastebuds will thank me. \n\nI am of the opinion that too many toppings detract from the quality of the meat, and you lose some of the flavors. Get it authentic style, and enjoy!","Best quesadilla I have ever had.  I go with steak extra meat with hot sauce and sour.   Real coke.  Sure the place isn't fancy.  But I'm reviewing food darn it!  And its great!","We've gone back multiple times, and this is our go-to place for no-nonsense killer tacos and burritos.  Every meat we've had to date is killer;  the el pastor and barbacoa are incredible!  Great beer selection as well, and impossible to beat $2 tacos for the portions they give you.","This place is great! Super value, amazing tastes, and lovely staff. It's all the best things of a fast Mexican grill, with none of the bad things.","I cannot believe we just found this place!  My only complaint is that we live right up the street and haven't been there before this.  Absolutely wonderful Mexican food and a superb staff with great prices.  Go there today!!!","Very tasty tacos, especially the tacos al pastor.  The only recommendation I have as a serious pepper lover is to have more peppers.","You'd never guess how great this place is if you're one to judge a book by its cover. The location is less than desirable, but the food is AMAZING.  Probably the best chicken burrito bowl I've had.  You know it's good when the signs, the staff and the TV show in the background: all in Spanish.  Will I come back to this place: absolutely.  In the next week:  there is high probability.","Habeneros is just like Chipotle and Qdoba. Seems that this concept is new to Madison based on the other reviews implying that this dining experience is a new one for them.  Coming from Denver where excellent Mexican food is common, this meal was good but not a stand-out.  Tasty overall.  Generous with the portion of meat and able to add unlimited toppings without any extra cost.  A good place for a quick lunch.","One of my favorite lunch places. I've tried just about every type of tacos and all are great. The pork varieties + chicken are my favorite. LOVE the cilantro and limes. Ask for the salsa on the side if you do not want watery tacos.","Underwhelmed after the hyped expectations from the other reviewers. Easy to miss, small store front in strip shopping area. It is relatively quiet except for the game shows on the TVs. Blackboard menu is a little confusing at first. My \"server\" (counter service only) was very difficult to understand; nice enough. I had some difficulty understanding his questions about how I wanted my food. Forget about drink refills, they serve sodas via bottle or can only. It is inexpensive and the meal was filling. I did not find the offerings particularly interesting or diverse.","Great customizable tacos, fresh toppings. Their chips and salsa are delish, better then most \"Mexican\" restaurants in town. Cheap food and beer, but still not on par with any taco place in Southern California or Texas.","I originally ignored this place when I saw a Chipotle reference (note: it's just counter style). Not that I don't love my occasional Chipotle fix, but that's not what I was looking for. I just wanted REALLY good food. After rereading reviews, it sounded tempting and I put it on my radar. Shortly after, we ended up in the area and were hungry, so we gave it a try. I am so glad we did!\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly. The prices were very reasonable ($2 for a super stuffed taco?!). The meat (between us, we tried the pastor and beef) was incredible. So were the sauces/salsa. I kept my toppings fairly minimalistic, but it's nice to know you can add what you want. The flavor of the food was fantastic. We all left so satisfied.\n\nI will definitely be back, even though it's in an odd location out of the way (for us). Oh, and they serve beer.","Disgusting! Ordered Guacamole & chips, though the guacamole was green that was the only resemblance, flavor was horrible. Pork for the taco was similar to the consistency of baby food but flavor was so bad my boyfriend actually gagged when he tasted it. Food was cold, not even room temperature. Will not go back! No stars are warranted for this place.","Great food, plenty of it, and an unbeatable price. Much better than Chipotle or Qdoba.  Location is in an inconvenient spot, but for food this good, totally worth it.","Old management seems to be back when I want about 3 weeks ago. Food still isn't what it use to be from a year ago however. Sadly, I don't think it will ever return to that point in time.","It's like Chipotle, the local version. The spicy pork is great. Food is all a little salty and there isn't a water service that I can see (bottles of water and pop in a case, lemonade and horchata machines). But the food is really cheap (and if you only want one or two tacos, you don't have to get three). They really need to put out some bottles of Chula. No real hot sauce here. Also, they serve beer.","Delicious burritos, that's all I've had because that's the first thing I ordered and haven't regretted it once yet.  Hot/spicy onions are addicting","Fresh, fresh, fresh! These people care about their food. And they don't roll their eyes when you speak Spanish--they encourage you. Fantastic for my little girl and this Spanish minor. I always get vegetarian fare because it's so good. And cheap. And fresh. Did I mention fresh?","Delicious tacos,  I had one each of barbacoa, pastor, and chicken, all softshell.  The meat was well seasoned with the barbacoa being the best of the three in my opinion.  The habanero hot sauce was great tasting but my mouth was on fire after all three tacos.  I will be returning to try the other taco varieties and the breakfast food as well.  Oh and did I mention they are open til 3am on the weekends.  I will probably never go to taco bell at bartime again.  The guy working behind the counter was very friendly as well.","AHHHHH BURRITOS!!!!  This place is terrific.  I can't say enough good things about them.  The food is fantastic, the staff is friendly, the service is lightening fast.  Don't have much time for lunch?  Here's your place.  I can't wait to get into town to try their breakfast burritos someday soon!","This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Fast, friendly service, GREAT meat, always a tasty treat.","Just had lunch there for the first time. Loved it. I had a steak burrito, my husband had a chicken burrito. The meat was really good quality, tasted marinated and grilled, the veggies, salsas, pico, all great. You order at the counter, they make it right in front of you. Friendly staff, clean place, lots of different beverages, all priced fairly. We will be back!","Sunday night I was craving spicy, and was rather cranky about it. \nHubby went here, and brought me home some kind of burrito bowl thingy with spicy habanero onions, pork, corn, rice, sour cream, etc. It was fantastic!  Emergency situation (removal of hubby's face) averted! \nThank you Habaneros!!","Don't judge a book by its cover. Inside is clean and roomy and the food is great. Very fresh and delicious. The people there are friendly too. So glad I checked yelp for a place to eat here in Madison, WI. \nMy steak tacos were terrific. Muy Bueno!","Well, it's no Pedro\"s, thankfully.   Went here to check out what the yelpers are talking about.  Got a burrito and a quesadilla.  Right off the bat you can tell that their meat is good just by looking at it.  I started with chicken just to be safe and now I wish I had tried the beef because it looked so darn good.\nThe quesadilla was good but pretty simple.  The burrito was very good with great portions.  Everything was fresh.\nThe outside looks like it's a pretty small place but inside it is pretty big and plenty of space for people to sit down and eat in.  Crummy location though.\nWill be back for some tacos and the tortas look fantastic.  \nOpen kitchen so you can watch them cook your meal.  I like that.","Recently, Habanero's has opened up a new location on the north side of Madison. I have not seen the original owners/workers in there in a good 7 months. Since then, food quality hasn't suffered. Not the same place. They are now more stingy with portion sizes. I use to be able to get a burrito that would burst. I would be luck to get anything other than beans. Want Guac? Cost $75 more and they give you a half of spoonful. \n\nI believe extra meat use to cost $1. Now it's $2.\n\nDisappointed in what they have become.","Combo burrito is extremely good. Spicy pork and beef happiness. People are extremely nice and no skimping here. No fake stuff here.","Hands down the best burritos and tacos in Madison!","Actually I'm giving them a 3.75 for a rating. I've only ate here once while in Madison. I had a steak burrito. It was good tasting, some what large, and at a reasonable price. They have a big selection of ingredients that you can put in your burrito or taco. It's not a San Diego area burrito, but not bad.","Awesome food!  Friendly staff!  All around great place to eat. Highly recommend the burritos.","This place is absolutely amazing!  Great service, and better prices.  I can't believe it has taken me two years to get to this place.  I will definitely be recommending to all my Madison friends and I WILL BE BACK!  $5 for a burrito with everything on it!!  Plus they serve a wide selection of Mexican beers and everything is just so fresh.  I will not be going back to Chipolte or Qdoba anytime soon.  Keep up the great work Habeneros!!","Awesome, affordable food. Found this place just after moving to Madison & have gone back time & again. The staff is friendly; the place is clean; the food is great; & prices are reasonable.\n\nMy favorite are steak tacos on corn tortillas. DO NOT SKIP THE ONIONS! They make all the food on site & the pickled onions (slightly hot) at the end of the condiment bar are so flavorful that you'll want a heaping helping.","Went in for lunch the other day.  I wasn't expecting much, but when my coworker and I got there, the parking lot was packed.  It must be a decent place.\n\nThere was a line to the door, but it moved pretty quickly. I got a chicken burrito. My coworker got the carnitas.  We both enjoyed the burritos.  \n\nI was a little worried at first because the chicken was Cheeto orange. I don't know what sort of spice mixture they soak it in to make it that color, but it tasted just fine. \n\nThe drink menu was just cans of soda in a cooler. I'm not a fan of places that do that. I like a fountain drink. I like free refills. Around lunch, I need all the caffeine I can get to make it through the remainder of the afternoon.\n\nI don't have anything bad to say about this place. Like Chipotle, Qdoba, Burrachos, and Pancheros, it does what you'd expect.  It's not really better or worse than the others, but I would go back.","Habenero's serves excellent build-to-order burritos and tacos. (Order at the counter, choose your shell, meat, toppings, etc.) The portions were generous, prices reasonable, and the service very good all three times I visited.","Anything everything on their menu is great. The owners are so nice. I especially like the tacos. Try the pickled onions - they are deliciously soaked in habanero peppers.","This place is seriously good.  It's kind of like a really good chipotle grill...but actually authentic!  The food is very fresh and flavorful.  The service (been there twice) was really nice.  The prices and portion size are GREAT.  \n\nThe only downside, if it is a downside is that the clientele are VERY blue collar.\n\nIt is out of my way, but I will go here again and again and again!\n\nBest Mexican in Madison!","Massive, fresh, tacos. Massive, fresh, burritos. Awesome pastor and carne asada. Tasty horchata. Good prices AND they don't charge extra for sour cream, guacamole, and extra salsa! This is my go-to joint for quick tacos and burritos.\n\nUpdate: So apparently they changed things a bit since I was there last. They now charge 75 cents for guacamole, which is a bummer. Other than that it is still the same old deliciousness.","One of the selling points for Mexican food is that it is cheap and flavorful. Habanero's was only one of these. From a place named after one of the spicier peppers, one would expect more heat and flavor, but both were lacking. \n\nI ordered a burrito and filled it with chile pork (I think that's what they said it was. I just pointed.), rice, black beans, bell peppers and onions, cilantro, onion, corn salsa, pico, cheese, and those spicy onions (note: the onions were mildly spicy at best). I also got some of their horchata, which was a little on the watery side for me. Things to note: the rice is just plain white rice, no spanish or cilantro rice here. Also, if you are looking for spice you probably want to try the hot or extra hot salsa. The one marked as \"medium\" did not have a bite at all. \n\nAs others have said, the ordering process is Chipotle style: you choose what style of plate you want - burrito, tacos, tortas, quesadilla, etc. Then you pick your meat and toppings. The guys behind the counter were really friendly and nice, and I would give the service 5 stars. But the food is a 3.5: just A-OK. I would be open to going back and trying something else.\n\nHabanero's is located on the end of a row of stores that sell things like flooring. Pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it.","I have been working near, and eating at Haba's for fir years now. In my office we tend to eat here at least one a week. Not only does it always impress, but it never gets old. \n\nAsk the food is prepared fresh using traditional methods and spices. Everything they serve its hot, fresh, and large in proportions. They don't have fountain drinks, which is fine since my food it's often to go, and the choices are plentiful. \n\nThey just opened a second location near my house, it's dangerous for my wallet :(\n\nSince I've found this place I've not been back to Chipotle out Qdoba."],"business_id":"Xys8CR7m-Lf8j3SUSAN9Ug","name":"Habanero's Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Me and my husband were in the area and decided to try this place out. I'm glad we did!! Food was delicious!! I love the chimichangas and the chips, salsa, and bean dip are great! We don't mind traveling from Tolleson to eat here.","My go to place for Mexican food. Chimichangas, enchiladas and menudo are my favorites . Big portions , decent price.","This place is a hidden gem. I used to work near the other location (near Metro Center) and ate there all the time. I was delighted to find another location closer to where I'm working now. Great place for lunch or take-away after work. The chips and salsa are possibly the best anywhere. The salsa is clearly fresh-made and it ROCKS. \n\nI swear they don't make anything until you order it. My favorite is the fajita burrito with chicken. The veggies are fresh-grilled and always have just the right texture, and the chicken is perfectly prepared as well. I have NEVER seen them put a styrofoam container in the microwave (as one poster stated) and can't imagine why they would (or would need to). \n\nThis is not a fancy place. The atmosphere is just adequate. Go to Chili's for that. If it's really good food you're after, you won't be disappointed!","Best salsa in town and I've lived here for 37 years and been to the Salsa Challenge every year, but nobody beats Mi Pueblo. I like to mix the mild and hot 50/50. All their food is delicious and very consistent. Not as greasy as *bertos. So glad I live right down the street. Oh yeah, their party platters are awesome too.","Service is very nice. Chimi was a little too deep fried. Burrito was ok. Every bite seemed uneven....Taste was average but still good. Price was good. I'd consider going here again for some easy Mexican food.","I ordered a shrimp burro - they grilled the shrimp, filled it with lots of stuff, and smothered it with a delicious sour-cream type of sauce.\nThe all-you-can-eat chips and salsa are good.  No problem with doing your own refilling, that way you don't waste.  We loved mixing their hot and mild salsa together, and just having a container of each.\n(we ate in, but I see that they do a pretty good \"take-out\" business as well)  They're close to a water store, so if you need to refill your 5-gallon bottles...","They used to have some awesome Tortas on the menu but they sometimes have the bread if you ask they can make them.  I really like the fish tacos omnomnom","This is a little North Phoenix strip mall restaurant with consistently tasty breakfast burritos and great service. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get my food after placing an order; super efficient when picking up food to go.\nTry some chips and delicious homemade salsa while you wait, they do not disappoint.","We stopped in 10 minutes before closing to grab a quick dinner.  They close at 8 so we had to be sure not to be late.\n\nMy hubby is adventurous and asked the nice cashier what the \"best thing\" is on the menu.  He said the steak burrito.  My hubs went with that.  I tried the b2 pork burrito.  As we waited for our to go order I could help but noticed they warmed something in the microwave... Maybe just melted the cheese?  It didn't give my that home-cooked feel I was hoping for.\n\nWhen we got home with our precious cargo, we were glad to see they had marked the top if the container with our order.  There was a bag of chips (nothing special) and 2 little salsa cups.  Next time I will ask for more salsa because it was pretty good though quite a bit if cilantro, which I'm fine with.\n\nThe pork burrito had a yummy tortilla and is served enchilada style.  The pork was slightly different than I expected.  I thought it would be like a slow cooked tender chunk kinda pork but it was more of a diced pork chop sautéed in a pan.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor is good- nice and smoky.  The texture of the pork was just on the edge of being rubbery.  The hubs really liked his steak burrito.\n\nI would go back again since it is nearby... But it's nothing too impressive.  No really spice is used here so I just give it a middle of the road rating.","We were introduced to Mi Pueblo by a friend and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food. The décor is nothing special, but the food is good. My husband always gets a chimichanga and I love the veggie burrito. They do a nice job with pick up orders-- our food is always prepared and ready when we call ahead.","I walked into this hole in the wall in a shopping center hoping to find some authentic Mexican food. As I walked in, there was a woman washing tables. I placed my order with a man on the phone clearly having a personal conversation but he paused long enough to take my order. After I ordered, the woman who was washing tables strolled into the back where you can see them prepare the food. She wiped her hands on her dirty apron and reached for a tortilla with BARE unwashed hands I almost walked out right there but was so shocked I just watched in disbelief!! She proceded to slap some ingredients on it from containers rolled it up sprinkled some cheese; still no gloves. The best part; she put it in a styrofoam container and then PUT it in the microwave!! Mouth dropped to the floor after just paying $8.14. I walked out and threw in the trash, so disgusted!","Such good Mexican food... the open faced chicken chimi is delicioso!","Delicious south American cuisine","We live just down the street from this little strip mall restaurant.  Why oh why didn't I find it sooner!  I am a very picky eater and sort of a bland eater. They were willing to keep things out or add things to match my odd tastes.  Husband is an eclectic eater and will try anything so we make a good pair.  He was impressed with the enchiladas and the homemade salsa.  I ate a chimi and it was fried to perfection.  Very authentic tastes and great prices.  Houston, we are going to have a diet problem here.","YUM!  Came here with the hubs.  I was able to get my authentic Mexican food fix and my horchata fix.  Scrum-diddily-uptious :)  Only thing- the hubs ordered me chicken enchiladas instead of cheese.  -1 point for the husband.","This is one of my familys favorite hole in the wall establishments in Phoenix. Almost as good as Valle Luna or the original Garcias on 35th and ossborn, but for a fraction of the price. Great tacos, rellenos, encheladas. The homemade salsa is excellent. They have coupons on yelp, groupon, and entertainment book, don't pass them up.","Great food.","I went here for the first time because of a group 5 for 10 deal.  I have to say the staff was really friendly.  Prices reasonable.  The quesadilla I had was awesome.  I also ordered some nachos but ended up having sour cream and guacamole on them which I couldn't eat.  I definitely will be going back.  This takes the lead for my cheap taco spot in town.","My friend and I went to see about the groupon I asked the cashier if I could buy 2, he asked to see my phone i handed it over thinking he was just reading the fine print and he hit buy and confirm. I later called to speak to a manager about this unauthorized charge and was told to call some other time the Metro Center location was not  anymore help. I'am astounded the clerk had the audacity to spend my money without my consent.","Despite the promises of tasty Mexican food, this place seemed sooooo mediocre to me! The people are friendly, and the food is cheap, but I'd be willing to pay a bit more for one thing that really lacked in my experience - FLAVOR!\n\nI had the #8 - Taco, chili relleno, rice and beans. It all came out quickly since I had the entire place to myself. However, nothing had a lot of flavor. Every piece of my meal seemed fairly bland. Towards the end it picked up a bit, warranting a bump up to 3 stars, but I just can't go above that.","I think I want to eat here every day this week. I came in on a slow Sunday night, and wanted to go back on Monday (but I finished my leftovers instead), then Tuesday, and I actually think I might go back tonight to try the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada. I got the Chicken Fajitas plate, and my husband got the tamale and taco combo.  Everything was fresh, not too greasy, and extremely delicious. This is my new quick and easy Mexican food restaurant. Yay!","We went to this place this evening to redeem a yelp \"$10 for $5\" deal. I'm not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating. It was good food, but the price was high and the portions were tiny. The quesadilla we ordered was the worst offender, as it was made from a taco-sized tortilla. I have never seen such a tiny quesadilla in my life. If it was a kid's meal I may have understood, but it was $4.99! The chimichanga was pathetic, too. I think the guy working there must have given us a kid's chimi on accident, because i can't imagine anyone spending money at this place on a regular basis for a chimi so small. It was literally 2\" wide by 6\" long by 1\" tall. That's for a $6.99 chimi. Macayo's charges a few bucks more for a chimi that's more than twice the size. I guess the only decent thing was the free chips and salsa, although the chips had enough salt on them to decrease my cardiac health by about 50%. I'm not sure why anybody salts anything anymore, with all the negative medical news on excessive salt consumption, but that's another problem altogether. As for this place: I tried it...probably won't be back. Caramba is a much better restaurant for a much better price.","Was in the area and made a spur of the moment stop as we were hungry. I ordered the chili rellenos and taco plate, and my husband a chimichanga plate. Both were very good! The chips were also great, very light and crispy. Much better than any of the chain Mexican places. The place was small but clean and friendly. Was so glad we stopped!!","Oh so good!  I get take out from these guys every week or so and have never been disappointed.  I'm a creature of habit and am addicted to their chicken burrito.  My husband loves their twin chimis.  It's a little hole in the wall restaurant with hardly any seating, but they consistently deliver great food which is not something every restaurant can claim.","First time here. Also one of my first reviews. This place was actually really good. Great salsa bar with hit chips. I had the #13 steak fajitas, $8.99. Girlfriend had the #12 sour cream chicken enchiladas. Horchata was pretty decent. We both really enjoyed our meals. Pros- tasty, cheap, quick, salsa bar. Cons- kinda dingy. Overall- give this place a try! Its worth it","Excellent food. Good Steak Quesadilla and the churros are hella good at 2 for a dollar. I'd go back again.","Now that's a good tamale! \n\nIt was only one of the three items in my combo - the others were a beef taco and a cheese enchilada. All were tasty, but the tamale (beef-machaca?) took the prize on that plate. Beans and rice were both decent and then I sprinkled on some of the magic dust that was in a shaker on the table. BAM! Awesome spice that seemed to be a mixture of red pepper flakes, chili powder and perhaps a touch of cayenne. Nice. Another sprinkle jar on the table was some nice, fresh Mexican Oregano. All of that was washed down with a full half liter of Mexican Coke. I'm not sure why so many places are now importing Mexi-coke, but I like it. This si the only place I know of that is using the 1/2 liter botles that are returnable. \n\nOnce again, this place features Mexi-coke, but offers Pepsi on the fountain for Coca-cola haters. As much as I like Pepsi, I still gotta have the glass-bottled Cokes. I wish more places would also import the Mexi-Pepsi!\n\nAthena had the Chile Relleno, which she said was very good but perhaps could have used a bit more flavoring in the batter.\n\nThe salsas were fresh, but as with almost every salsa these days, it has been gringo-ized and could definitely use more kick. The hot isn't that hot, and it's of the chipotle variety. Is it too hard to make some pico de gallo and toss in a bunch of serranos? Heck - just mince up some serranos and offer them on the salsa bar.\n\nOne more note: if you are dining in, there are fresh, tasty tortilla chips available under the heat lamp at the salsa bar.","Went there this morning and had the bacon burrito...YUM! Talk about filling...I have a big appetite and this place fills me up~\n\nCheck it out if you are in the area it is so worth it!","Talk about a hole in the wall place!!! Awesome food at a great price and the staff was friendly and pleasant. \n\nWe did breakfast burro's Egg & bacon and my wife Steak fajita burro (all was very tasty)\n\nIf you are looking for a quick place to get some good Mexican food this is the place!","Okay so it is a little hole in the wall and the greasy smell when I first walked in almost made me walk back out BUT I stayed and ordered and I must say that I'm glad that I did!\n\nI ordered the Tres Enchiladas plate which they changed up for me (normally you get one chicken, one beef and one cheese) to just three sour cream chicken.  I also ordered my husband the two chimi (one beef and one chicken) combo plate.  The dinners came with rice and beans and they included chips and salsa in the to go order without having to ask for it...nice touch!\n\nI get home and open my container still a little apprehensive after the smell of the restaurant.   The first thing I notice is the size of the enchiladas.  Wow!  These were the most chicken stuffed offerings I've had from any Phoenix restaurant!  Then I tasted them......oh, they know how to do an excellent enchilada!  They were so flavorful and the sauce was light and creamy.  Totally rocked it!\n\nThe beans were also very good.  Full of flavor, nice and sticky firm and not soupy like some places.  Total win.  Only thing that was disappointing was the rice.  It was just there.  Not much taste, bland, boring.  yawn.\n\nOverall it was amazingly cheap and very, very good!  The fact that it's just down the street?  Bonus!","Not too shabby... Of course the interior isn't much to be desired, but I have always learned that some of the best Mexican places are tiny little run down shacks. \n\nWe hit this place up on a Groupon purchase and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious plates that arrived. The fresh chips and salsa were great, service was pleasant and quick, as our overall experience was above average. I had the tamale/enchilada plate and my husband had the two chicken tacos plate. Both were pretty good and the price was cheap (even if we weren't using our $1 for $10 Groupon).\n\nThanks for the experience Mi Pueblo Mexican! We enjoyed!","Un assuming store, kinda dingy, and small. BUT!!! The food is amazing! As authentic as it gets. I had the taco with enchilda and a quesadilla. WOW!! I could have eaten somethign else too, and I wish I had. Definitly try this palce!!","Best little Mexican restaurant in the area. Carne Asada is tender and not fatty!! Eat here a couple times a week","Potato & Eggs plate was alright, searing hot tortillas in that foil, and the hotter salsa was tasty.  Seemed like a buck or two high for what it was, a little breakfast plate & soda running about $8.  Nice ambience and friendly staff.  Food alright.","Authentic mouth watering food.\nGot the steak fajitas dinner....extremely satisfied.","Best hole in the wall Mexican food in the valley! And they have a cute little salsa bar too. Love it!","THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN! \n\nMi Pueblo has been my favorite Mexican food for years! Forget the chains and the greasy taco places. Mi Pueblo is authentic and fresh tasting. They don't use lard yet their food still tastes so traditional.\n\nIt is NOT fancy inside. You order at the counter and help yourself to their delicious hot chips and their zippy fresh salsa. The family that owns the place is so nice. They never mess up an order even complicated ones. \n\nThe food is incredible. My husbands favorites include the fish tacos, twin chimis, and the green chili pork. I love the chili relleno, the enchiladas, and the bean tostada. Try them for breakfast too! Huge plates of egg dishes, potatoes, beans and tortillas. Perfect hangover remedy! And I think they serve menudo too!\n\nEverything is reasonably priced. You spend half as much as if you would going to Valle Luna or Macayos and the food is 10x better. We have ordered their party trays before for football parties and for our wedding rehearsal dinner. For under 40 bucks you can get a gigantic tray full of mini tacos, chimis, and quesadillas. They are supposed to feed 8-10 but they are big enough to feed more than that!\nMmmmm...","Mi Pueblo is a small place tucked into a strip mall off of 7th St and Union Hills. It has been there for at least 6 years that I know of. \n\nI wanted something Mexican ish for lunch today and needed to try a new place. \n\nI was greeted by a nice girl and looked around a bit. They have 30 combo lunches/dinners pictured on the wall. I did not see any other type of menu. I asked about the Green Chili and she said it was good. \n\nThey offer a chip bar with 2 types of salsa and the carrots in hot stuff. LOL The salsa was a fresh tasting red salsa and a roasted chili green type both were good and complimented the chips perfectly. \n\nThe burrito was a generous size and was covered in green sauce and cheese with sour cream on the side. The in-nerds were flavorful and plentiful, the pork was tender and nice sized chunks. (I did have one fat hunk) The beans were good and the rice was OK. It tasted like a nutty taste some how. ?? \n\nright around $7 and I could not eat it all.","I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the \"hole-in-the-wall\" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling.","Chile Relleno plate was pretty good here the beans were good the rice was meh. The chips and 2 diff salsa's were good tasted fresh. It didnt take long and Horchata was good! All in all I will stop here again and try some other dishes since its really close to my new pad!"],"business_id":"Yb2pNCxYR32XKmpirqJqeQ","name":"Mi Pueblo Mexican Food","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Delicious tacos! The Mexican pizza needed sour cream and hot sauce- which was a little extra- but good! My husband loved their habanero salsa, but for sure pass on the fried ice cream! It's just frozen ice cream rolled in corn flakes...ew","I remember when this place was old Super Mex, so I was expecting pretty much the same. It was just a weird experience.\n\nFrom the beginning, the design outside in the front is weird. I guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave, but it just looks really bad. Also, the front says 24 Hour Video Poker, which I just found strange. Yes to promoting 24 hours, NO to video poker. Just makes it seem like it's going to be really crappy bar food or something. \n\nThe host who sat us seemed like he had no idea how to host. He just seemed lost, but it wasn't a big deal. We got seated very quickly. We were greeted by our server, Jose, who was great. He convinced us to get Margaritas in spirit of Fat Tuesday. He wasn't pushy at all, very friendly and nice. He took our order, and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he won't be our server tonight. Poor Jose was being sent home because it was slow. It was strange as it wasn't super slow in there. It was even stranger that Jose seemed to linger on about this, almost to the point of talking down about the establishment. It was sad, I liked Jose and wanted to give him a tip but I didn't have change and he had to leave. \n\nWe were told of the special, which sounded like Chic Parm, except substitute chicken with steak. It sounded awful so we went with Carne Asada and my friend got Shrimp tacos. My carne asada, for the price they charged, was pretty wack. You expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender. It lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada. The rice and the refried beans were good though. Shrimp tacos were all right as well.\n\nThen it just took forever to A) get the bill and B) get the server to get the money back to pay the bill. In the meantime I had a random woman (guessing it's the owner) asking me if everything was all right. It was, it was just strange. Who are you? Are you the owner? Random patron? What is going on in this place?!\n\nFinally got someone to pick up my check. The total was $19 and some change. I put in a twenty. I get it back and I get no change. I mean we're talking about like 50 cents or so, but really? I didn't get any change back? All right? \n\nI'm not mad about the experience, it was just really underwhelming. I love Mexican food. I think this place has just a major image issue. What is it? Is it an authentic Mexican restaurant with Jalisco specific recipes? Or is it like the Mexican version of PTs? Or is it Mexican version of Applebees? Is Jalisco spanish for Applebees?","Jalisco, I'm sorry, but we need to break up. It isn't me. It's you. 100% you.\n\nLast night, the wife and I went to Jalisco for dinner. We were seated quickly enough. The chips and salsa were brought right out. We even had our drink order taken quickly. Our server, Esmerelda, appeared shortly thereafter and took our order. \n\nMy order: 3 Combination plate - Cheese enchilada, Shredded Chicken Enchilada, Shredded Chicken Crunchy Taco and all rice, no beans.\n\n30 minutes later, Esmerelda stops by the table and asks us if we would like dessert. Ummm, I would prefer dinner first. She had a look of confusion flash across her face, glanced at the kitchen, the fear of realizing she had left our food in the window for who knows how long flashed next, before she said our food would be right out.\n\nImagine that, 30 seconds later, our plates were brought out. My \"crunchy\" taco was soggy, fell apart the moment I lifted it up. The kicker? Shredded beef, not chicken. Ok, I'll eat the rest, while we wait for her to check on us. First enchilada I dove into, also shredded beef. Seriously guys? 30 minutes and you send out poorly made, wrong food?\n\nFinally, Esmerelda stops back by, we show her how everything was wrong with my food. She says they'll get me the right food out right away.\n\nWhile waiting for that food to arrive, I give the cheese enchilada a try. What could they do wrong with that, you ask? Somehow, the cheese was chewy. Not standard cheesy deliciousness chewy, but did they put some gum, or old tire in the cheese chewy. \n\nAfter a much shorter than 30 minute wait, a plate with a chicken enchilada, actual crunchy taco, rice and beans was delivered to the table. By then, I was a little over the entire experience and tired of chewing, after consuming the cheese enchilada.\n\nThe last two items were decent, not good, but decent. \n\nNeedless to say, Jalisco is not on my list of places to eat again. Ever. \n\nThis happened on a Thursday evening, they had maybe 3 other tables when we got there, no big rush leaving or entering at any time when we were there, so it wasn't like we got lost in the shuffle. \n\nAlso, having a Yelp logo asking for reviews on the menu is bad form. May want to double check the Terms of Service on Yelp before you do your next run of menus. I didn't notice it until the server was picking up our menus, else I'd have photo'd it.","I gave this place 5 stars 2 years ago when it was Super Mex ( always thought that was a dumb name) . I'm pleased to say now that it is Jalisco Cantina (better name) the food is just as good if not better. Fantastic salsa, delicious yellow rice and wonderful flavors throughout the menu. Also love the new festive paint colors they chose for the interior, one of our favorite places for Mexican food!","The best Mexican restaurant in Vegas/Henderson!! They have tons of coupons in the Entertainment book and they do Groupons so it makes it even better!! Love the creamy chipotle sauce on EVERYTHING!!! Yummmy!!!","So SuperMex changed into Jaliscos. Some things are the same, some are totally different. \n\nSame: décor, atmosphere, 24 hours, bar, etc. \n\nDifferent: menu, you can now order multiple styles of Mexican pizza, the ceviche has lobster, there is a HUGE bowl of very good albondigas, the salsa is spicier, overall, BETTER.\n\nStill just average cuisine, and everyone stomach hurt a bit after. The cheese enchiladas were average. We did not care for the shredded beef. The ceviche was also just ok, it needed more cucumber. The soup and the nachos were the best, which is not saying much for a Mexican place. \n\nI wish Henderson would step their game up for authentic Mexican food. I know this is a short review but really, there isn't much to say about this place. It is decent, but that's all. Nothing stands out from food to service. I wouldn't doubt another name change is soon to come.","We were worried when the change happened, but honestly I like the food better.  The only thing we do miss is the green rice from Super Mex was much better and we like green chili verde, not red.  Besides that, we love the place, the food, the margaritas and their service is always great.","Mediocre Mexican at best. Food is as uninspired as its strip mall surroundings. And with lunch costing $15 for a drink and two a la cart items, way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go to Roberto's instead. Same quality food for half the price.","Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \"yeah I know it's bad.\" \nWon't be going back.","I am really hoping I just had a rare bad experience at this place but that never happened when this was Super Mex.\n\nMy first review was glowing. They seemed to have not missed a beat since becoming JC from Super Mex. All was on point then minus the chips and salsa. This last visit I had was just disappointing.\n\nThey still have the grilled veggie burrito on the menu that Super Mex had, and I decided to order it again now that they're JC. Man, what a mistake! It was absolutely flavorless and overdone on the black pepper. I mean OVERDONE! All I could taste in each bite was black pepper! Brought my Mom for the ride and she said she could smell the black pepper clear across the booth! Absolutely awful! The waitress asked me if everything were good and I lied and said yes only because I was in a hurry, and didn't have time for them to do it over.\n\nMy Mom was a fan of their chimichangas when they were Super Mex and she said her order this go round as JC was extremely flavorless as well. And my favorite waitress wasn't there anymore. :(\n\nAt the end of the day, goodbye Super Mex. You will be missed. Also, goodbye Jalisco Cantina, but you will not be missed.","The service was par had to ask for  refills and place was not busy!The food was very good, the service was the worst ever!  I ordered Ceviche and I never got it, my wife order two chicken taquitos dry nothing on them and Chicken taco no lettuce - cheese only and they messed it up and then the food runner acted like she should take the messed up order.   When we got the bill the food server told us she took care of the bill that is correct.  When I look through the bill, the server double charged us for the combination plate chicken taco and two taquitos.   Very disappointed there is 67 Mexican restrains in a 13 mile ratios.  We have a lot of other options next time.  They have lots of food servers and food runners, just not a lot of service going on, never got a refill on the salsa and had to ask for water and ice tea refills .  We live in green valley, if they are still open in a couple months, might give it a try AGIAN!","AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! Came here while I waited for my car to be serviced and I was there for 1 hr. I came in just in time for Happy Hour and I got chips and salsa at the bar. I ordered 2 Bud Lights, and the Carne Asada Tacos Tijuana. My check was $7 something. The tacos were delicious and full of meat. They are not cheap when it comes to serving you meat. The tacos came with a side of rice and beans which were also delicious. Their salsa for the chips was superb as well. No complaints on my end at all! The bartender Allen was great and I will definitely be back for more!","I've lived near Jalisco for 2 years and LOVE Mexican food yet have never had the desire to try the restaurant because the sign is ugly and uninviting!! My husband however knowing my love for Mexican food decide to take me there for a date! I've now been to Jalisco twice and have been sooo impressed with the environment, service and food!! I have greatly enjoyed my experiences!!!","This was the first time here since it changed over from Super Mex. We went for lunch. We were seated immediately and were given chips, salsa and bean dip. I like the chips much better than before. These are triangles as opposed to crispy whole tortillas. I ordered cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole. My daughter ordered the carne asada street tacos. Everything was very fresh and tasted very good. The guacamole was freshly made but was a little bland for me. I added a little bit of salt at the table and it was better.  We will be coming back again to try other items on the menu for sure!","I've stopped in here a couple of times, late at night. Great late night happy hour from 11pm - 2am. The Tijuana street tacos...so much food for $5 happy hour price. And they are really good. Order the habanero salsa, I dare you! This has become my favorite late night, close to home hang. Awesome bartenders with great personalities.","Stopped in around 2am on a Friday because we wanted beer and some Mexican food after getting off work. Well, we got the beer, but waited almost an hour for our food... I have to mention that we were the ONLY 2 people ordering food. The bartender kept coming over and apologizing that it was taking so long... but I'm still confused WHY it took as long as it did. They only offer half the menu that late at night, and it's not like we were ordering extravagant meals.\nWhen our food finally came out it was absolutely inedible. The shrimp in my burrito was burnt, as was my boyfriends fish, chicken, and shrimp tacos... We had to flag down the bartender to tell her we just couldn't eat the food. So we ended up leaving, still hungry, an hour and $20 later...","I think the daily special - carne asada like- dinner was ok nothing special about it.  The price is right for the food however the drinks were kinda pricey.  A regular margarita tasted nothing like at Lindo M...that was waste of $ however the tall margarita was much better :) A bottle of beer is almost $5 kinda high for this place. The server was friendly and very helpful overall I enjoyed the meal I chose but not the margarita or the price of our bill","Went here for lunch yesterday. The service was good, friendly and fast. The chips and salsa was the best part of the meal. I ordered crispy tacos, they were soggy and the shredded beef had no flavor. While the service was good and the complimentary salsa and bean dip was tasty, I wouldn't go back here. I can go to Roberto's and get a much better taco for far less.","Great place for lunch - good value and Kelly the bartender does a nice job too!! They have delicious carnitas, and taqueria too!  Today I'm have the Casera chicken taco salad!","We went back to Jalisco Cantina and I am so glad we did.  Very busy night.  I had the fish tacos as I usually like to try at any Mexican place.  I am please to report that they are the best fish tacos I've had.  The breading was light, a perfect texture.  The Jicama slaw was what put these over the edge, good.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer, which was a bit chunky for my preference but the taste made up for any issue with texture on my part.  Fresh fresh fresh.  Such good flavor.  Service was stellar!  We will be back.  Regularly.","HUGE fan of this Mexican restaurant as Super Mex. Was sad when I arrived and saw that it was now Jalisco Cantina. The menu is a tad different but the atmosphere was still the same, and my favorite employees were still there. \n\nNext thing I noticed different outside of the name were the chips and salsa. Super Mex had the super-sized round chips and JC has regular chips. They were still tasty, however. \n\nI typically order the Super Mex burrito and my mom the taco salad, but we both stepped out of the box as I ordered the vegetarian nachos and she the chimichanga. They were both AWESOME!\n\nAt the end of the day, I will miss Super Mex. They were here a long time and loved their food. But Jalisco Cantina is great in their own right, and are worthy of carrying the torch. They are their own entity, so comparing them to Super Mex would be unfair. But, they are worth the visit and try, and I will be back often as the food is absolutely delicious!","A recent transplant to Las Vegas -  I have found my \"Mexican food home\" with Jalisco. The Street Tacos are some of the best I have ever had and the Carne Asada is always consistent. My wife loves the chees enchiladas. Another real nice touch is the refried beans served alongside chips and salsa. Try not to fill up on them as I always do, and always find myself taking leftovers home, which are almost as good as the original a day later. Highly recommended!","Came back due to an invitation from management. Decided to order the exact same thing as last time. It was significantly better this go around. Mom said her chimichanga was better as well. They've reeled me back in and I will be back more often. This is great news because I love the atmosphere and intimate setting. \n\nI have to say that I still miss Super Mex (Sorry management. This is not your fault.). But I am getting over the fact that they're gone and Jalisco is now here instead. But, I can say that I took my Mom to Lindo Michoacan today for Father's Day and we both agreed that the food there still wasn't as good as it is here as Jalisco Cantina. Oh and the manager here insisted that the grilled veggie burrito wasn't on the Super Mex menu, but I beg to differ. It was, I ordered it often and it was amazing every time that I did.","This place sucks as did Super Mex come to find out it's the same owner. They think that adding spice or making the plate hot in taste makes it a good Mexican restaurant. The chicken was hard and dry and serving queso fundido with \"tostito\" chips is a No No tortillas is the way to go. The bottom line is this is a gringo restaurant.  I will not be back and I will not recommend this place.","The food was very good, the service was the worst ever!  I ordered Ceviche and I never got it, my wife order two chicken taquitos dry nothing on them and Chicken taco no lettuce - cheese only and they messed it up and then the food runner acted like she should take the messed up order.   When we got the bill the food server told us she took care of the bill that is correct.  When I look through the bill, the server double charged us for the combination plate chicken taco and two taquitos.   Very disappointed there is 67 Mexican restrains in a 13 mile ratios.  We have a lot of other options next time.  They have lots of food servers and food runners, just not a lot of service going on, never got a refill on the salsa and had to ask for water and ice tea refills .  We live in green valley, if they are still open in a couple months, might give it a try AGIAN!","We stopped eating at Super Mex because it was way too expensive for bad/mediocre food. Saw the sign changed and figured we would give it another try.\n\nThe menu was upgraded a bit over the Super Mex menu. Gave a combination a try, so I could try a couple different enchiladas and their crunchy taco.\n\nThe chips were better as chips, than the big discs. Their salsa has improved, too. We emptied that salsa bowl!\n\nFood came out, maybe a little slow, piping hot! Seriously, the wife opened the foil wrapped around her tortillas and they were steaming for a couple minutes. So, the food is very fresh!\n\nMy crunchy taco was delicious. Their shredded chicken is moist and flavorful. The taco shell was not super hard and it seemed to be freshly created, rather than a packaged shell. Their enchiladas were equally as delicious, I cleared the plate completely, and went back for more chips. \n\nStuffed is an understatement!\n\nFor the negative, $3.50 for a single taco seems high. $4.50 for a single enchilada also seems a bit high. The combination seemed to be relatively fairly priced.\n\nOverall, we won't avoid this place like we did Super Mex, we just need to be in the mood for a little more expensive of a meal.","I've really enjoyed this place, even when it used to be the ol' Super-Mex. You will not find traditional Mexican cuisine here. But it is not a Qdoba or Baja Fresh either. It's somewhere in the middle, very similar to a Lindo. Plus, I've never had a bad meal here.\n\nI wanted to check out Jalisco's ever since they bought out the Super Mex. When the Groupon came out, it provided me with just that opportunity. I can assure everyone that the food is pretty much the same quality, which is a good thing.\n\nLet's start out with the complimentary tortilla chips. They are a wonderful balance of crispness and greasiness. The salsa is on point, with a slight kick, and fresh flavors.\n\nI thought that the shredded meats, beef and chicken, were a little bit on the tougher side, but not by much, I still enjoyed them in their taquito, enchilada, or taco form. The sauces had well balanced flavors, and everything was well seasoned! Everything tasted very fresh as well! The guy did mess up my order a lil bit by forgetting my tortillas that were supposed to come with my queso fondito... I was about to go into Hulk smash mode, but realized that sometimes things happen, maybe not the way I expect, but in a way that makes me want to eat my hot cheese with a fork.\n\nJuan's flaming will be my go-to spot for tex-mex cuisine. But, Jalisco's isn't too far behind, and I like the fact that this place is centrally located. A packed dining room on a Wednesday night can't be wrong as well!! They also have some killer happy hour and graveyard specials.","I am definitely a fan!!! After an awful day including my car breaking down, being towed, and $$$ later....I was at Pep Boys (thats another story) and found out that my car wouldn't be done until the next day. My friend and I wandered a few stores down and saw Jalisco Cantina where we decided to grab a drink as we waited for a cab. I am SO happy we did! \n\nWe sat in the bar area which had an awesome screen showing the Thursday night football game. The bartender was AWESOME, I think his name was Alan, and he was helpful and attentive. He suggested and explained multiple items on the menu, brought some chips and salsa, and had a great knowledge of the tequila as well. Since we didn't know when the cab would arrived, he suggested we get something to-go and we could snack on it there if they hadn't came yet which worked out perfectly!\n\nAlso, the chips and salsa were amazing. I am a huge critic of Mexican food in Las Vegas, to be honest I think most of it is horrible. Every restaurant I've been to has pretty mediocre if not bad salsa, adding things that shouldn't be in salsa. However the salsa at Jalisco was delicious! They even have a habanero salsa that is crazy hot-I may have overestimated my heat tolerance by bragging too much then eyes watering as I took a huge bite. :) hahah oops! It was still really tasty though, just super spicy which I love! The tacos we took to go were really good as well, I will definitely be back for a full dinner!","Had a lunch special that was one of THE best tasting, unique dishes I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  Don't be afraid to go \"off menu\" here!  \n\nRestaurant recently changed name & decor but not ownership (I asked).  Great value menu available 24/7.  Highly recommend.","Really good food .  Fresh ingredients and prepared very well.  loved the Omelete.  Great Chorizo","I am not a local, but during the week of Inside Bitcoin: Las Vegas - there was a group of 40-50 people that went here because Jalisco Cantina accepted Bitcoin! Everyone was extremely happy about it. \n\nThe food was AMAZING, the Vegetable Fajitas were delicious. Service was phenomenal. Absolutely no complaints. \n\nIf you like Mexican food, this place is a MUST.\n\nHappy feasting. Cheers!\n\n===\nPS - Let them know you want to pay with Bitcoin :)","I'm giving it a full 5 stars for serving up one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. Mexican or otherwise. Bacon wrapped shrimp and Carne Asada steak with fresh sides. Good service and cool open kitchen. I will be back. Often.","All the familiar deliciousness of Super Mex...with a new name. Still my favorite Mexican food in Vegas! Also, the change in the tortilla chips is a welcome one!","Yo quiero Jalisco! Service was quick and efficient. I had the chimichanga and my wife had the street tacos, both of which were excellent. The food did tend to be on the spicier side for this suburban Jewish kid. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.","Very disappointing...\n\nIve been going to this place for a pretty long time. However, it was when it used to be SuperMex. tonight was my second time visiting there after they changed.  I gota say that I am not happy with the joint. Super mex used to be a great place to get a cheap and delicious bite to eat. But now its gone :( I used to go in there all the time to enjoy some delicious chicken tortilla soup for around 5 bucks.. which was a great deal. the same soup now comes in a smaller bowl and is nearly double to price. I would have to say that 9 dollars for a bowl of soup is kinda ridiculous for a place like that\n\nThe first thing I experienced upon walking in the door was the hostess who gave me a menu COVERED in salsa and food. I opened it to find red sauce just running down the page as well as beans all over it. I told her that it was gross and to give me another one.. She then rolled her eyes and walked away with it.. Never to return with a new one. Finally our server comes out (who was the only reason this place didnt get a 1 star rating) and gave me a new one. Our servers name was Lisa and she was awesome. Very nice and very efficient. She even brought out new chips and salsa without having to be asked.. which is a huge bonus for me, as I love chips and salsa.\n\nWe then order our food. I had the Mole. The Mole was very generic.. Good.. but generic. The chicken however, was terrible.. It was very tough and chewy, and had alot of fat on it. I bit into a huge chunk of fat and instantly felt sick,  You could tell the chicken was not cooked in the sauce. I would assume it was thawed out, already cooked and was just warmed up, and covered with the sauce. My gf had the enchiladas, which werent bad, but also very generic in my opinion. \n\nI gota say the only good reason to go there was the chips and the service.. But not for food. Which is sad because its mostly a restaurant.  It is also more expensive by far after the name change. Save your money and go elsewhere.","I don't want to give t hem 2 stars, but it is accurate.  I thought it was just ok.  We loved Supermex.  It was our favorite Mexican place.  So when they changed...I was skeptical but hopeful.  The menu did change so my daughter was bummed her favorite burrito was no longer there.  I didn't have just one favorite so that didn't bother me.  I ordered pork carnitas.  I hate to say it but they were just not good.  Half of the meat was so crispy I couldn't eat it.  There were some crunchy things in it I didn't care for as well.  Everyone else in my party said their food was just ok.  A taco salad and a combo plate with tacos.  Not sure I'll be back. Service was not great either.  Salsa and bean dip (the two best things we had!) were gone and never replaced and refills were empty well before the end of the meal and not refilled.  Disappointed.","We decided to try this place after reading all the Yelp reviews and we loved everything we ordered. Chips and salsa are delicious. My raspberry margarita was yummy! We will definitely be back.","Different name but still a great place to eat!  Same owners and staff. New menu that is delicious!  You have to try the Mar y Tierra.  So good!  We were skeptical to go because we thought that it was going to be a different experience. Very relieved to see that LISA was still there. We had her as our waitress many times before.  She is Great and is very friendly!  We definitely will go back how that we know.","Two tacos with rice and beans is VERY filling! I was pretty hungry and I could only eat one taco. I got the asada and al pastor - both packed full of meat and very flavorful, especially the al pastor. Taco shells themselves are a bit too small tho; you kinda have to use a fork to eat. Comes with pico and guac. Mexican cheese was plentiful and delish on the plate! \nFree chips and salsa comes with a chipotle brown and a bean dip - both yum even tho I prefer red salsas. \nI ordered a Dos Equis on tap, too, and got a HUGE one in a beverage glass. A beer glass would have been classier, but hey. :) \nThis place is open 24 hours which is amazing. For the quality and price, I'll definitely be back. :)","Happy Hour in the bar has crazy good appetizers in huge portions at $3,$5 & $6.00!  Great tasting house margaritas for $2.50 but the best part is this restaurant offers green cilantro rice besides the standard red and you can request your pinto beans whole instead of refried.  Their house salsa has a great roasted tomato flavor too...so much more interesting than the usual around town.  We loved this place as Super-Mex before the name change and were delighted to see they kept the mainstays of the place the same.  It's all good!","Came here for lunch the food was good specially the salsa, I had the tostada special and my husband the two taco lunch everything was delicious. The waitress was nice and friendly. $20 it's a good price for this meal.","Well I tried Jalisco again because I had the Groupon. Not happy that they charged me an extra $2.75 to add a bit of rice to my Chicken Taco Salad AND this is after messing up my order when I said I didn't want it in a tortilla shell. Really?!?  The food has gotten a little better but I still miss my old Super Mex.. :(","had a shredded beef burrito that was on the lunch special menu and for the price theyre wasnt much special bout it but it was a decent feeling meal","Happy hour was amazing!! The street tacos were great with so much meat!!! Wish we lived here we would go all the time!!","Me and my girlfriend had a group on for this restaurant so we decided to give it a try.  It was about 10 at night and I ordered the Mexican pizza.  I can honestly say that I had a good experience and the waitress was awesome.  Her name was Imelda.  My drink never got below the halfway mark and she was there on point.  The music was a little loud but it was tolerable.  I would definitely eat here again.","The food is great! Really tasty and well priced! I was a little upset because the server seemed overwhelmed, stressed, and in a hurry. The server stuck out his tongue and said gross after I made my order. I think that is just plain rude. I hope that they can hire more people to help out because the service was pretty poor. I think this place has potential, but need some more training for the crew. \n\nNot sure this is a place I would recommend to my friends and family."],"business_id":"YkgYT5kfaDSq9IgsGvmS3g","name":"Jalisco Cantina","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Decently good Mexicanesque food. I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've gotten here, except for the fish tacos. Right now, the carne picado is my favorite dish -- full of jalapeños and juicy marinated meat. In addition, their salsa is tasty and the chips are nice and light.\n\nIt's near my house and always good. The dining room is cozy and well taken care of. When I'd rather just pick up dinner for the family, they have a handy pick up window out back. I really can't complain.","Good chips and salsa!","There was a time in my life when I was coming here every week with my mom.  I probably still would be if we lived here, but we moved from Peoria in 2005.  (Yeah, I've been going for years and it's always been consistently good.)\n\nBut even though it's been a several years since we were regulars, our server Andrew still remembers us and can bring us our drinks before we even order.\n\nThey've got the salsa down.  I could eat a bucket of the stuff.  I don't know what makes it so special, but it's my favorite salsa ever.  Perfectly thin, crispy chips that aren't greasy.  And they aren't stingy with refills.\n\nMy favorite item (my favorite food, PERIOD) is the Pollo Especial.  Shredded chicken and green chiles fried in a tortilla, then smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar.  Sounds simple, but anytime I've gotten a similar item elsewhere, it doesn't hit the mark.  If you get this at dinner it's a lot of food.  The lunch sized version suits me just fine.\n\nCan't say how their dessert is.  I've always been too full to try.","The best salsa I've ever had - and the only one I can actually eat by the chipful. The chips are always fresh and never stale. Service has always been fast and friendly. Prices are cheap, especially for lunch. \n\nI usually get the enchilada (ordered with no onions, green sauce) with rice and beans, all around $7. \n\nI could eat here everyday and never want for anything else.","This place seriously is the best Mexican food in Arizona (of all the places I have tried)  I have been hearing about this place from my Father in Law, ranting and raving about it.  He was not wrong.  Huge portions and amazing fresh flavor.  I could have drank the salsa it was so good.  It was such good salsa I had them box up the left over salsa so I could take home and finish!!  hahah\n\nI can't wait to go back and try more.  I had the taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans.  AMAZING.  Seriously can't wait to go back and try more.  Also was glad to hear they have a place in Mesa too (that's just a wee bit closer)\n\nCheck out the picture of my plate.  If that doesn't make your mouth water - you need to get checked out!  Go try this place - even if its a little bit of a drive.","This was my second visit here-- my first visit was a few years ago, the last time I was in the Phoenix metro area. There are so many good Mexican places here that knowing which one(s) to visit can be a bit overwhelming, so I rely on the locals to give me tips.\n\nMy sisters have lived in AZ since 1995 and this is one of their fave Mexican places in the West Valley. One thing I must comment on is their salsa. I LOVE THE SALSA AT MANUEL'S. I'm a fiend for good salsas and Manuel's has some of the best around, in my opinion. The food is fresh, decent Mexican, though pretty Americanized by my standards. It's served by friendly people. Gets busy here on weekend nights but definitely worth a visit.","I can't help but give this place 5 stars. The food is always great. I love their chips and salsa, some of the best I've ever had. I love their shredded beef tacos, their green chili con carne burrito, and their taco salads. It's affordable, casual mexican food. Very easy to make this place a regular restaurant to eat at.","I decided to try this place with my family and the service was GREAT! Sergio and J.P. were our servers and made sure that we had a good supply of drinks, chips and salsa.  When our food came is when it went all down hill... the food was TERRIBLE, my 3 year old wouldn't even eat it, he eats everything. I had soup and the meat was HARD.... and well the broth was greasy. My g/f had the fiesta plate (she was sharing with our son) and there wasn't anything special about it at all, some of it tasted like plastic!\nThe only reason I gave one star at all was the service, chips and salsa. We didn't end up  paying and went and ate somewhere else. Such a disappointment this place was, and over priced too.","It was pretty decent. Our service was great.  The food was good.  No complaints, but I also wasn't blown away.  They did give me really fresh corn tortillas that were really good.  I'll probably try the tacos next time.","Good place for some decent Mexican food.  It may be better, but I Mexican food seems to have a glass ceiling on how good it can be.  I ordered the Taco Salad (aka: the not healthy salad), and it was very good.  I also tried the fried ice cream, it was good, but somewhat disappointing.  I will say the service was excellent.","What else can I say?? We LOVE this restaurant!!! The chips are great as well as the salsa. I can't get enough of the Seafood enchilada. I haven't had anything bad in the 10 years I have been going to this restaurant. The service is good and everyone is friendly. What more can I ask for???","I enjoy going to Manuels. I had never been to this location until last night. \n\nIt is clean, the food is delicious, the service is friendly. The prices are on par with other comparable mexican food places.\n\nMy GF smashed her food quickly and was thoroughly satisfied. She told me to give them 5 stars. I told her to get her own Yelp account LOL.\n\nI give them 4 stars. They lost the fifth star because I felt like the menu was pretty limited. What they did have on the menu sounded really good, but I felt like I was lacking options.\n\nI tried the chicken fajitas. They were indeed good, but I was expecting more trim to come with my sizzling skillet. The skillet itself was delicious; chicken, onions, bell peppers, half tomato, and cilantro (on the stems?)...But on the side, just two tortillas, green sauce, guac, and sour cream. I am used to other places also giving me some shredded cheese, lettuce, and maybe pico de gayo. It was good, and that is their design. I guess I just care for a more vibrant fajita. \n\nOh yeah and this is the kind of place that gives you rice \"OR\" beans, but not both (most meals)...I think there's something screwed up with that. Anybody want a Jelly sandwich? Peanutbutter is available if you order it seperate.\n\nNone the less, I was full, and my lady was pleased. I will certainly go back anytime. \n\nPopos is still king.","One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.  Service is consistently good, food is consistently good.  I often order the 3 Amigos.  The carne asada is excellent.  Can't go wrong with this place.  Been here at least 30 times.","I have found that the quality of the food at many of the Mexican restaurants tends to vary depending on who is cooking that day and on what time of the day you come in for your meal.  Some time the longer the sauce has simmered the better it is.\n\nI have never been disappointed with the food at this Manuel's.  Salsa is always great and the meal is always tasty.  I also consider their prices to be reasonable.  I used to love Macayo's when I first got to the valley, but they have gone downhill.  They seem to be too cost conscious.  Someone also mentioned Top Shelf as being better.  I found that to be totally bland.  \n\nI pretty much like all the Manuel's, with the exception of the one over around Bell and 12th Ave.  But, maybe I just had a few bad days there.","Don't come here much. Food came out quick and pieces are great. \n\nIf you want decent Mexican food and your in the area stop by.","Great authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. Free chips and salsa too. Oh and they have delicious margaritas. Very friendly.","We ate at Manuel's once about 15 years ago and have been addicted ever since.  I was raised here in the Phx area and was used to 'real' mexican food and Manuel's is it!  Great Chips and Salsa and Dinners.  Service is great and friendly and have had no problems ever with the service or food.","Patio seating is great. Waiters are awesome. Food is middle of the road. It's a good place to go with it being close to my family's home.  Fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share.  Specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren't picky.  It's the go-to place for sit down mexican when we are in town.","Hands down best mexican food in the valley great for the family get togethers bdays the whole thing is a great expierence!","I was in the area for a meeting and had time for a quick lunch. Found it on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I was greeted and seated quickly. Chips and salsa were pretty good - had a chicken chimichanga, which was good. Prices were reasonable. The service was mediocre - the server was working really hard, but it seemed like he may have been responsible for a few too many tables. It took a bit of time to get refills and the check, but it wasn't a huge deal. I am from New Mexico, so Mexican food in Arizona is always a bit different, but this is definitely a solid choice for some decent food. I would return if in the area again.","Great homestyle Mexican food. Excellent salsa. My favorite is Tuesday $6.99 special. Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada and rice and beans. For an extra buck I get a chicken enchilada instead. Have been coming her for over 20 years and it's just as good!!!","I have always had good food and service here. I have been coming to this Manuel's for as long as I can remember. I love it!","I came here with my wife and daughter for some dinner. My wife and i have been here before so we figured it would be decent.\n\nThe service was lackluster. The waiter took my wife's order and mine, but ignored the fact that I had my daughter with me. I had to chase him down to give him her order. Drinks ran low a few times and we had to ask for refills. Empty plates sat on the table until another waiter decided to clear them for us. \n\nThe food was.... well, the chips and salsa were the stars of our meal. The chili relleno wrapped in an omelet was.... different. I can't recommend it though. My taco and tostada were overwhelmed by scallions. The sauce for my enchilada tasted exactly as if it had come from a Banquet microwave meal. My daughter barely ate any of her two mini tacos. My wife grabbed her leftovers since she wasn't interested in finishing her chili relleno and said \"no wonder she didn't eat her tacos! These are terrible!\" \n\nWe were very disappointed with our meal. I could have gotten better food from a Rolando's at a better price.","Great family owned restaurant with outstanding service by friendly people. My beef taco was filled with flavorful, tender meat and no gristle or fat. Enchilada sauce is creamy and delicious. All the right proportions of meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Great Gringo salsa, great flavor and not spicy. We'll be back!","I will have to say that out of the \"Hispanic Restaurants\" this one is better. Better than macayos and better than don Rubens in my opinion. It's on and off for us as it was so good it almost put my wife into labor when she was pregnant lol. She had the fried ice cream after the chimi and we were both in sugar heaven. It just isn't consistent for us. Give it a go. Get the enchiladas or my favorite is the green tamale(it's sweet)","Come here everyone and then, my bf  loves the enchiladas, they are good but not my favorite. The servers are always nice and the food is fast!","Great family owned business where food always tastes good and you are always greeted with a smile","Seems like everyone else liked this place, but the service was terrible, the salsa was bland and watery, and the tamale was not that great. They got the refried beans and rice right, but how do you screw that up? Avoid this place for the weekend lunch - the service was literally nonexistent.","Amazing Mexican food done right for years. One of my favorite places. Green corn tamale, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco!","The two stars as defined by Yelp as \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is a great definer.  In fact, I would amend it to say \"I've experienced A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT better.\"\n\nTo establish my credibility, I must first say that I had been in the food service industry for almost 10 years (highschool and college) and so I've worked low end and high end and I think after experiencing different levels of the food industry, I know what I'm talking about.  Additionally, as a food service worker, I would have appreciated a guest like me letting the restaurant know if there was something amiss.  However, there was so much wrong with last nights dinner that I could have had an hour long talk with the manager about the millions of things that needed to be done to fix the quality of the restaurant and in particular, Manuel's service.\n\nSo, I'm sure you're wanting to hear about the restaurant.  I came in with a larger group around 8:15.  I called ahead to let them know we were coming.  We had a range of people that I thought were coming - between 10 and 13.  They were busy and part of their restaurant (the bar portion) was closed due to renovations, so this already busy restaurant had limited capacity.  No problem.  My group was relaxed and flexible.  We had nowhere to be and the bartender made us a couple of drinks while we waited.  (He was probably the best part of the night.)\n\nAs we waited in the front room, a hostess in a very rude voice asked if we had any idea of the real total of our party yet.  She claimed that it would change our waiting time (which was of little importance to us) and said, \"you only have 7 people here right now, how many more are going to show up?\"  I calmly told her at least 10 and we'll squeeze together if we need to add more, no problem.  I don't know if she was having a rough night, but it was just her attitude, tone, and the fact that she did not approach us to have the conversation but rather stood by and hung on the seating podium that really irritated me.\n\nOnce we were seated (around 8:45 or so), we grubbed on some chips and salsa.  I must give a kudos to Manuels for this, the chips and salsa are tasty.  Its a shame that the same quality did not extend to the rest of our meal.\n\nAround 9:20 or so, we hear this terrible clanging of silverware behind us.  All of the servers had decided to roll their silver right behind us.  So, for a half an hour, we got to listen to people rustling, quite loudly, silverware as they did their side work.  Ugh, annoying.\n\nWhen our food came out, our orders were wrong.  If it had been one or two, then we would have changed it .... but... if we had all complained, pretty much every dish would have been taken back to the kitchen. At least on my side of the table, my tacos came out on the wrong tortillas, they were greasy, and the quality of the beef is very very fatty, oily, and tough to chew through.  My friend also ordered two fish tacos, also presented on the wrong tortillas, and the fish were in large fillets that did not span the length of the tortilla, so you were eating at some portions just pico and tortilla... kinda weird.  The server also got my husbands order wrong (he ordered the chicken fajitas) and she brought out a second shrimp fajitas.  Trying to be accommodating, he took the shrimp instead of asking for his original order.  She knew that she had made a mistake in this but still charged him for the more expensive shrimp fajitas.   Additionally, the chefs do not know how to portion equally as my husband had 5 shrimp in his fajitas and my friend that had ordered them on the other side of the table had close to 10.  Thats a lot of extra shrimp.  And the server did not even check in to make sure everything was ok.\n\nFinally, when were only half way through our meal, around 9:45, they started rolling down the metal window coverings.  If we were there after closing time, which is I believe 11, I could understand, but there was still an hour and 15 minutes still left to service.  We just felt so unwelcome and with every passing moment, we were becoming more and more irritated with the restaurant.\n\nI'm a Tucson native where Mexican food is not only delicious but there are plentiful options.  I just moved to phoenix about 6 months ago and I have been not only disappointed with Manuel's but with every Mexican restaurant that I have found in Phoenix.  Is there not even one that has decent food?  \n\nMy take on Manuel's is that if you're wanting expensive prices (12.95 for two tacos and a side of beans with a sour cream, kind of what might be considered a guac, and a tomatillo sauce condiments) with mediocre quality of food and irritating service, then this is the place for you.  If  not, well... you get the picture.\n\nHappy eating!","Some of the best Mexican food in the valley.  Everything is good, the food, the service and the atmosphere.  The food is delivered quickly and I often leave there amazed at how little time I've actually spent there yet have never felt rushed by anyone.\n\nLove, the salsa, some of my other favorites are  the pollo especial,  steak picado and the rolled quesadilla.","Went there on a coupon from dealchicken.com and enjoyed it very much.  We were there at lunch and  were seated in the bar area quickly which was fine with us as it was a booth.  The waiter was attentive and competent.  I think some may not be too interested in being attentive since we were there on a coupon but that was not the case here.  I had the machaca beef which was well seasoned and a huge portion that I was not able to finish (and I really skimped on the beans and rice because I could see how much beef there was!!).  The salsa and chips were very good that was a chunky type which is my favorite but they also brought a hotter version which was a thinner concoction that we added to the large bowl of salsa.  My wife had a lunch special combination which she also liked.  The finale was when the waiter asked if we wanted anything else to finish off the $30 coupon and we were at $28 and I opted for the sopapilla;s which is a favorite and I expected 4 or 5 with some honey but it was a huge bowl with 20+ in it!!!  We took almost all of them home and ate them for the next couple of days.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was just that I like to see things like barbacoa, adobada, etc on the menu also.","Not sure why I have not reviewed Manuel's. We have been eating with them for the past  maybe10 or more years. We eat there at least once or twice a month. Why do we keep returning?\n1. They are always very nice and make you feel they are glad you are there.\n2. The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting.( We always take food home with us. \n3. The food is priced reasonably. \n4. They are a neighbor hood family owned business and I always try to support this type of business. \n5. There is something on the menu for all tastes. (Some people that go with us like hamburgers.)\nWhen we go there is usually at least 6 people in our group. No one has ever complained about the quality of food. It has always been good. \nThey have always treat us as a valued customer. I often recommend Manuel's to other people.","What can I say.... This is hands down one of the best places to eat!  Visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter.  Service is great, food is excellent, prices are perfect!","No complaints","This is chain restaurant quality. Not very good Mexican food at all. And is very expensive for what you get.","By far not my favorite place, but others seem to love it.  Stopped here for dinner last night.  Chips and salsa are average, prices are high.  Best thing to me on the menu is the carne asada, but it costs about $17 for the meal so I don't get it often.  Had the combo #2 and have to say I liked it.  The beef taco was good, and the ground beef enchilada wasn't too bad either.  Think the plate was about $10, and came with a side of rice, but no beans.   They have made some changes to the decor since I was last there, but still think that the food is average at best.  I will say that even as busy as they were, food came out pretty fast which is great when you have hungry kids.  FYI - parking sucks.","Great service and amazing food. Best chips and salsa! Fast place to eat lunch if you only have a short lunch break. Amazing desserts; flan, fried ice-cream, sopapillas and hot apple pie Ala mode. The hot apple pie Ala mode is probably the best dessert they serve; it comes with this sizzling sweet butter rum sauce and a huge scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Absolutely to die for!!","Best Mexican food hands down.  Can't beat the machaca plate, extra crispy.","My trophy wife and I and a few of the offspring decided that we wanted to try out this Manuels. We picked Friday night at 6:30 and the place was packed with a 30 minute wait, but the staff moved the customers in and out very quickly and we were soon munching chips and salsa. The wife is very picky about salsa, not really liking any restaurant's offering that we have experienced in the last few years so imagine my surprise when I looked at the bowl of chips and there were only little pieces left. We had very prompt and attentive service, me and the wife splitting the order of pollo especial because one of my fellow yelpers recommended it and they were certainly correct. Everyone was delighted with their food,and we all scarfed the sopapillas afterwards.This is a great place to take your family to have someone else do the cooking  and enjoy some wonderful Az style mexican food.","Went for breakfast a week or so ago. The staff was all polite and the place was clean and packed so we had high hopes. We had a cheese crisp, machacha and eggs and a chicken chimichanga with fundido sauce. All were ok but really greasy and bland for Mexican food. Next time we will go to one of the other local places, Valle Luna, Macayos, Top Shelf even Garcia's.","I was pleased with my first visit to Manuel's Mexican Restaurant!\n\nThe chips and salsa were addictive and the waiters did an excellent job of giving us more when we ran out.\n\nThe food came out really fast after we ordered it which surprised us. The cheese crisp was quite good! I liked our tacos and our chimichangas as well. The service was good for the most part.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that it does seem a bit more expensive than it should be, but they served a good meal nonetheless.","Far and away better than....Garcia's, Top Shelf, Valle Luna Etc... The salsa is a little sweet with just the right amount of spicy \"bite\" to it. The best part is the \"pollo especial\" a chicken chimi covered in a spicy cream cheese sauce! My only gripe is that there isnt a location closer to me in the far west valley!"],"business_id":"ZPz_yTApvQcNyINEFsCpOw","name":"Manuel's Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I love Qdoba I just wish there were more of them.","I don't understand all the hate for this place. Like the guy before me said \"clearly the refried beans have gone to your head.\" There are so many more choices here and the food is flavorful. Plus, how can you not love queso sauce? ARE YOU NOT HUMAN???\n\nI'm a little 110 pound girl but I love big portions so the amount of meat and everything else they heap on there is amazing. Plus they seem to always have quality meat. More than once I have stopped by a Chipotle, the barbacoa tasted and had the texture of meat that had been chewed and then someone decided they didn't want to swallow it and put it back in the meat bucket. \n\nWell I'm not here to rag on Chipotle, but I am here to tell you what a yummy place you're missing out on. I understand everyone has a bad day and maybe one time they had crappy rice or something, but who are you to judge something after one experience? My favorite sushi place has had one bad day, I never judged them on it and you shouldn't either.\n\nI'd recommend this place as a great lunch spot, it's quick and delicious. Don't forget the queso :D","The staff is always helpful and pleasant and the food is always super fresh. It is always  clean and I never leave sad. Even after we dropped our entire order on the floor by accident they gave us the same thing without charging us and had great attitudes even when cleaning it up. Delicious food and great service!","I love Qdoba I go here every weekend have a Member card etc. Many people think of this as the same thing as Chipotle they are very similar except I here they have a bit more choices I believe. I used to go to Chipotle a lot but once I found this place this is all I ever go to. Best thing about this place is the Queso Burrito. Best thing on the menu.\n\n Also when I ask for a side of rice they give me a nice cup of rice on the side for like .80 cents unlike Chipotle when I asked for a side of rice they give me this little \"shot glass\" sized plastic cup of rice and expect me to pay 1.35 or something like that. \n\nNow I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food. I'm sure you can find some authentic mexican place if you want that but this place has its own menu and its own flavor. Definately a place you should try out and see for yourself.\n\nI am a regular at the Rural Rd location and love the people there. They are nice and friendly and since I always have a hard time deciding they give me some pushes in the right direction to get me to decide. ;P The place is always clean and have never had a problem here.","Always has been good!","I only stick to the tacos because I'm not into the monster burrito stuff. They do have some of the best shredded beef and it's great in their tacos and taco salad.   The one thing that sets this place apart from the rest(besides the great meat) - the salsa.  Their Habanero salsa is outstanding - tasty and spicy.","Although Qdoba is just one of the many \"Mexican Subways,\" it is in a class of its own. The freshness of the ingredients and the explosive flavors set it far apart from the rest. This particular location is clean and has professional employees.\n\nHaving tried just about everything on the menu, I have a few recommendations. Invariably, if you stand in a line at Qdoba, every customer in front of you will order a chicken burrito. Don't do that. Although the burritos are excellent, I would probably rank them last on my favorites list at Qdoba. Instead, try something different.\n\nFor meat, I highly recommend the barbecoa (shredded barbecued beef). It sits around simmering in its own juices and spices all day, which cause it to have explosive flavor in every bite.\n\nFor dishes, the little known secret and best item on the menu is the tortilla soup. If you're more hungry than soup, get the Mexican gumbo, which has all of the contents of a burrito topped off with the tortilla soup. It doesn't get any better than that. My backup favorite is the quesadilla. They are always crispy and good for dipping in Qdoba's several tasty flavors of salsa (\"hot\" is the best, but they are all great).\n\nThe portions can be quite large at Qdoba and it can be hard to decide on which meal to have on a particular visit. Therefore, a nice option is the craft two menu. This allows you to pick two Qdoba dishes, each at a smaller portion than when ordered alone. Hence, you can try two smaller dishes and not get totally stuffed when you eat everything.\n\nMake sure to pick up a Qdoba rewards card at the register. They are free, work at all locations, come with a free chips and salsa at activation, and earn you one free meal for every 10 that you purchase.","Okay, so being a huge fan of Chipotle and noticing a trend that Chipotle-style restaurants that offer the line style of food usually are way below par I was not sure about trying this place. They were offering buy 1 get 1 coupons and we couldn't afford not to try it in case it was a good find. The food here is okay. The flavor falls very short of Chipotle and the flavors run more on the bland side. The first time I ate here I felt like I could barely taste my food. For two people to get full for less than $8 bucks though....sometimes you just suck it up and make the exception. We both usually get the Queso style burritos, mine vegetarian, my boyfriend gets chicken or steak. Now that I have eaten here a few times, when the coupon gets me, I'm a bit more acquainted with the flavors and find the food to be tasty. Not great, but not bad. Let's put it this way, I would not pay full price to eat here...but if a coupon presents itself and I don't feel like cooking, why not?","Man I love Chipot--I mean Qdoba. Last time I was here I was stopping with co-workers and wasn't starving, so all I got was the chips and queso. Delicious, expect the mountains of salt on the chips. Moderation, people, moderation.","This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. \nThe chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!\nThis place has the worst \"Mexican\" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food.","I love Qdoba.  I don't eat here enough.  None close to my house.  I used to work next to this location and the staff is better than most restaurants like this.  My favorite thing at Qdoba?  Nachos.  Pork Nachos, Steak Nachos, any nachos as long as they're smothered in Queso sauce!  MMMMM!","Qdoba is pretty simple, form a line, tell the dude what you want, he makes it and you eat it. Its like Subway for burritos. Awesome!\n\nI usually like to go to Chipotle, but this Qdoba pulls me away. \n1. They move through he line with a quickness I have never seen before.\n2. The staff is really friendly and they always at least act semi happy to are in their store. \n3. It's clean and has a nice patio i can chilax on while on a break from work.\n4. They meat quality if better then other burrito places\n5. They have more options. \n    two different kinds of veggies\n    cheese sauce, high five!\n    gumbo\n    and a combo option so if you cant make up your mind between a quesadilla or \n          tacos, you can have both, or gumbo and a salad\n\nQdoba = winning!","Good burritos. The queso sauce is pretty good with chips.","I love the food at Chipotle so much more, I'm not sure I would ever go to Qdoba again because Chipotle has set my expectations too high.","Flour taco w/ Chips and Queso are the way to. Hands down better value over Chipotle.","The food is absolutely terrible at this Qdoba, or maybe it is all Qdoba's I don't know.  Either way, Qdoba does not stack up to Chipotle.  Better than Someburros?  Nope.  Better than Filliberto's?  Not quite.  Better than Taco Bell?  Doubtful.  Better than a Hot Pocket?  Yes, but what isn't?","I stopped in to pick up dinner one night after the line for Chipotle was nearly out the door. I'm doing a low carb thing so I opted to try their naked salad bowl - lettuce, chicken, black beans, cheese, guacamole, and hot salsa. It was good - a different variety than the Chipotle salads. I would come back, though probably not for their burritos. I would like to try the other items on their menu","My co-worker and I stopped in for lunch today. I had been here once before maybe six years ago. I ordered the pulled pork quesadilla. The girl behind the counter prepped it and put on the grill and when the time was up to pull it off, the tortilla got stuck, I could already see it was partially well done and falling apart, she really had to scrape to get it off the grill. My advise: PAM cooking spray. \nI thought she was going to suggest to remake or offer a discount. I paid for my meal and sat down to eat. It was so soggy I could not pick it up, I had to use a fork. I can understand that maybe the pork was so juicy thus creating the well done soggy tortilla. The pork was good, but the tortilla part was so mushy and then the cheese just globbed. I pretty much just picked the pork. The guacamole was good. \nI would suggest maybe for the pulled pork entrees, drain the juice, otherwise you just end up with a soggy mess. \n\nNot the worst I have had and not the best. This would not keep me from coming back, next time I will just ask for the tortilla on the side or maybe some chips.","Let me start this off by saying that I love q'doba, the food is delicious. Reason for 2 stars you ask? Well I'm currently standing in line, I'm the only one here. I was greeted with \"I'll be right with you\" and then I waited while the two ladies here finished their conversation! So while the food is great, this experience was not!","It's no Chipotle but a good alternative when in a hurry between Lowe's & home. Family was going to kill each other unless we ate so we stopped at the first (non-fast food) place we found.","If you want to try some of their menu items made with their melted queso, this might be a good place to visit. I didn't try any of those bc I try to avoid dairy.\n\nBut if you are just going to try something on their menu that is similar to the Chipotle menu (like me) then just go to Chipotle! it's literally one block away and much better.\n\nI tried the steak burrito bowl here.  I ordered it exactly like I order my Chipotle burrito bowls (white rice, black beans, corn salsa, pico, red salsa) and it was alright, but not as good as Chipotle. for one, the black beans weren't cooked the entire way through and were kind of hard and raw at parts. the red salsa was also weird in that it tasted sort of like spaghetti sauce? literally the moment I had my first bite, I thought to myself - this reminds me of spaghetti. everything else from the corn salsa to the rice just wasn't as good as I could have had at Chipotle. for $1-2 more, Chipotle is worth it.","I went here once and then went back to try it again. After entering and observing, I realized that this was going to be the same exact underwhelming experience as the first time. As a matter of fact, they are pretty much a factory of that exact experience. Kind of annoying. \n\nThe food was salty. Really salty. I've had so much better Mexican...I don't understand this place being successful here. I can only imagine that it is because we have so many transplants here in AZ and they have trouble trying places they don't recognize the name of. \n\nIts OK people. There are real Mexican's here who have been making food for years! Go to one of your local places, check it out. It will destroy this corporate blandness that has salt as its only spice.\n\nYou are on Yelp, you could look for a place near you! A Mexican place that only exists here in your town! Has no other locations 2500 miles away from Mexico. Its OK to adventure out of what you know! Its actually why some of us are Yelping, so you can go to the places that are good, not the ones that suck.","I've been having a run of really bad lunch destinations in the past week. \n\nI was craving Mexican food earlier this week and a coworker had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree at Qdoba. Now I'm not really sure what an entree consists of at a place where everything is ordered a la carte, but figured that a burrito was as good a guess as any, so I opted for the pork.\n\nNow, according to their menu this pork had been simmered in a blend of tangy tomatillos, jalapenos, garlic and lime juice...and their marketing division deserves props for that appetizing description, because it's all a smoke and mirror act. It tasted like pork. Plain old pork. Very tender pork, but straight up pork all the same.\n\nAdd cilantro lime rice (uh, plain ole white rice with specks of green?); black beans (at least they didn't try anything pretentious there); pico de gallo (some of the blandest tomatoes and onions to ever grace a burrito); roasted chile corn salsa (for real, now? because I couldn't taste a hint of pobalano chile or jalapeno); and salsa roja (writing it in Spanish makes it more authentic. duh.), and wrap it up in a tortilla with a diameter the width of your torso. What do you get? A bland 3,000 calorie monstrosity of a burrito that needs to be dressed up with guacamole, cheese and lots of salsa to make it edible, if not very palatable.\n\nWe got the food to go and the bag for our two burritos felt like the bottom was going to fall out. Out of curiosity, I weighed the burrito when we got back to the lab. It was over 610.00 grams because my electronic scale recorded the weight as \"Err,\" and that's its max limit. That's over 1 pound and 5.43 ounces for you non-metric folk out there. Or if you prefer to express its weight more figuratively, it was the size and weight of a bunny, but didn't taste nearly as good. (Conejos son muy sabrosos!)\n\nI've also tried two tacos (pork and beef, see above for insight into the caliber of ingredients) and the three chile queso dip with chips. It was, to put it mildly, a disappointment. \n\nBut if you're looking for a sterile, fast food environment (seriously, if Chipotle is owned by McDonald's...who owns this joint?) where you can take bland, picky eaters to enjoy burritos that constitute more than your entire recommended daily allowance of calories in one fell swoop, hit up Qdoba. With that info in mind, you won't be disappointed!","So, I decided to check out Qdoba because I got a buy one get one free coupon in the mail - I ate one for dinner last night and saved the other for lunch today. I love Chipotle, so I had high hopes, but man, the food was terrible. i got 2 Naked Burritos - the equivalent of a Chipotle Burrito Bol - one with steak and one with shredded beef. The rice was undercooked - practically crunchy, the shredded beef had a weird aftertaste like it had been stored in plastic, and the rest of it (mild salsa, \"sauteed vegetables,\" cheese, sour cream) was just so, so bland. I ate them both because I'd paid for them, but the whole time I wished I'd just gone to Chipotle. Sigh.","So I can only review one item at Qdoba, because there's only one item I've eaten there since my freshman year of college in Madison... vegetarian nachos.\nI love them.\n\nWhich is why I was so glad to find out a Qdoba was opening up in Tempe. I'd tried the one in Central Phoenix once in a while, but it was really too far for me to drive to get nachos.\n\nI'm not really a fan of other fast food Mexican food unless I'm really drunk. But Qdoba is different. Because of those fabulous nachos. Black beans, wonderfully flavorful cheese sauce, cheese, corn salsa and a side of guacamole... mmmm..... love it, love it, love it. \n\nOn lunch trips with coworkers, my friends don't seem to be as impressed as I have been. But I don't care. I'll go alone.","A total chipotle rip-off. They have the same setup, with the white rice (with green seaweed things in it) and choice of meat beans etc. The prices are higher than Chipotle, a buritto was more than $6. The people weren't especially friendly or anything, but not a big deal. The food is nothing special, unoriginal, and expensive. If you'd like food that is exactally like Chipotle, then you may as well actually go to Chipotle and pay less for a meal.","This is a similar restaurant to Moe's and Chipotle.  I would say they are all interchangeable. Although I like the salsa bar that Moe's has and the others don't.  They have Shredded Pork (Carnitas)  which is always a plus for me.  The first time I had the pork it was great, the second time it was mushy, but very edible either way.  I would stay away from the steak, I found it rubbery.\nThey have excellent Guacamole and Queso dip and chips.\n\nEDIT: 10/17/2008\n\nI went back the other day and had the Mexican Gumbo.  This dish alone moved them up to a 4 star from a 3 for me.  It's pretty fantastic and a very different menu item from the other quick burrito places.  If you want something like chili but a little lighter I highly recommend it.","I actually dont mind Qdoba. This Tempe location was nice. Like the other reviewers have said, It's basically Chipotle. And to me there is basically no difference. The only thing that Qdoba has on Chipotle is that I like the tortillas at Qdoba better, they seem to hold together better.","You know what differentiates a lot of tomato based Mexican food from fucking Italian? Oregano and basil, both of which were in your \"hot\" salsa today. I put quotation marks around that because I guess it was supposed to be spicy but it tasted more like sloppy joe mix than chiles. I didn't ask for a freakin' Mexitalian burrito.\n\nConsistently the worst pseudo-Mexican food in the business. \n\nThe best thing that can be said for it is it'll form a turd. Pure fuel, not food.","I tasted my first Qdoba burrito last night. I went with the Queso Steak burrito. The burrito was hearty with lots of meat, rice and beans topped off with pico and some cheese and sour cream. My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients.\n\nI've had many burritos from taquerias to the burrito chains. Qdoba falls somewhere in the middle. I would gladly take a Qdoba burrito over a Chipotle or Una Mas burrito any day based on my initial experience.\n\nThe staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within 3-5 minutes.","My first Q'doba experience also happened to take place in Madison, WI where I would visit a good friend of mine while living in the Chicago area. This was back around '99-'00 or so, I believe, and I'd never experienced a Chipotle to compare it to. I really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when I moved to Michigan I would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. I was pretty psyched when the one on Rural opened up out here because Chipotle never sits right in my stomach (not that it necessarily stops me...but I always dread the impending doom that eating there brings). Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the Q'doba I remembered, and it's just sorta average. I like the chicken, but the steak is blah. Queso is ok, but I've had much better. This is the one place where I actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and I like the hot as well. No salsa complaints here. I usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at Chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (queso at the Q).","I eat lunch at Qdoba at least once a week and here's a list of the reasons why: \n1. They have THE FRIENDLIEST staff of anywhere I have ever been. They remember what I like to order and they are always happy to see me! \n2. The 3 Cheese Nachos with steak are to die for. I think I've become an addict. The food is always fresh, I always see them grilling chicken, peeling avocados, etc. in the kitchen. \n3. It is always very clean inside and the service is fast, but not impersonal. \n4. They have an amazing FREE rewards card! Double points on Tuesdays! I am sure that I have gotten at least 3 free lunches since I signed up for one! \n5. You can have a beer with your lunch if you want!  They have a liquor license, so it adds a little something extra!","Imagine Chipotle with more flavor.  It's almost a complete ripoff of Chipotle's concept, but with the welcome twist of more interesting meat, sauce, and cheese options.  \n\nI'm not big on 2lb. burritos, so I wouldn't frequent Qdoba, but it's certainly worth a visit every once in a while.","I don't understand the lack of love here for Qdoba. Maybe everyone has been sucked into the Chipotle burrito-sphere and the refried beans are affecting their brains. There are enough tortillas in the world to support more than one fast food burrito joint, people!\n\nDon't get me wrong. I like Chipotle too. I will enjoy a burrito bowl there from time to time. But Qdoba has one thing Chipotle doesn't offer - their queso dip. A squirt of cheesy heaven, Qdoba's queso makes everything taste better. \n\nMy favorite thing to get is their nachos. They load 'em with beans, your choice of meat, salsa, cheese, sour cream and 3-cheese queso. YUM! You get a heaping serving of salty yumminess for like $6.00. If I'm starving I can finish a whole plateful but there is certainly enough to share.\n\nSo do yourself a favor and indulge in a little queso therapy next time you're craving some fast mexican food. You may never visit Chipotle again.","I have to say I like Qdoba over chipotle about 75% of the time but the reason really isn't taste as i think they are about equal as run of the mill fast-ish mexican food. I like the mexican gumbo here, the taco salad has a tortilla shell, they always have discount coupons, the loyalty program is great and they don't want $1.50 for guacamole on a burrito like the other guys. The location is also good but with the new chipotle across the street (literally) it's Qdoba that wins out.\n\nAll that said i tend towards the gumbo,which is really just the burrito guts with tortilla soup on top, with varying meats each time but the new shredder pork is good in it. It's very filling and hits the spot for me. The burritos when i get them are packed full and the chips and queso or guac are always good.\n\nIf your looking for a wowing taste of mexican this isn't it but if you need a quick lunch or dinner and want a burrito or some gumbo it's not a bad place. Look in the ASU coupon books for great deals and if you get 10 meals the 11th is on them plus the occasional extra with the loyalty card.","The first time I went here, I got the shredded beef burrito ($6.29) and thought it was just ok (it was HUGE).  However, I LOVED their warm chips ($.99) and guacamole ($2.69)!  \n\nAlthough I've revisited this location, I haven't tried anything else off their menu...I just run in for an order of chips and guacamole.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the lightly salted chips and tangy guac.\n\nBTW, although I prefer Qdoba's chips, for burritos, I prefer Baja Fresh.  As others have mentioned, Qdoba is just like Chipotle.  It's even located across the street from Chipotle...go figure.","This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.\n\nIf you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the \"other\" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.\n\nIf you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.","I like to eat at Qdoba about once a year.  \n\nEvery once in a long while, I figure it'd be a good idea to consume 1200 calories in 10 minutes and I file in to Qdoba for a burrito. Yes, they do basically serve Chipotle's menu, but I like Qdoba's better.  Why? Because they offer a bit more variety--the ancho chile bbq burrito is tasty.\n\nStill, you're paying $7 something for a burrito that's bigger than your face.  Take that as either good or bad, depending on whether your concern is gastronomy or cardiology.","Great burritos.  I like Qdoba better than chipolte, the meat seems to have a better flavor.   The service is always great and fast.  So good....num num num","I hope this is the right location (directly across from Chipotle).\n\nOkay, this review is way, long overdue (like since December 2013), however, I must say while in town helping brother & family move- hubby and I worked up an appetite, as well as the rest of the crew.  So we were craving some good south-of-the-border place and figured we'd go to the local Chipotle Grill- but it was so busy and we were so hungry, someone suggested the Qdoba Mexican Grill right across the street from Chipotle.\n\nNever heard of this place, as I don't think we have any here in So. Cali, but once we got in and met the friendliest counter girl, Anna, my nephew recognized her from an earlier Christmas party and her smile grew even bigger.\n\nI didn't believe their food could be better than Chipotle, but after we satisfactorily satiated our appetites, I vowed to go back each and every time we make our way out to Arizona.\n\nYumm and delish is all I can say for Qdoba.  \n\nThe queso sauce was lip-smacking good as each of my tortilla chips took multiple dives in that well seasoned, warm, saucy deliciousness.   The Mexican Gumbo (sounds funny) but it was so good as I got to add whatever ingredient I wanted inside of that bowl of yummyness.\n\n5 solid stars for Qdoba and the same for the waitress/food handler Anna!!!\n\nIf only we had a Qdoba in So. California, tsk, tsk.","This location is pretty consistent. I have always taken my food to-go, so I can't vouch for the cleanliness of the seating area.\n\nVeggie nachos are my jam. Queso!"],"business_id":"ZZevr02C4b_g9RwnezdvWw","name":"Qdoba Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Yummy!!!!!!!\n\nI love this place, the food is awesome (especially at happy hour) the service is friendly and inviting and the atmosphere in the bar is excellent.\n\nJust for the record I always went on happy hour, a few beers washing down the free tortilla chips and dips followed by one of their delicious appitizers.\n\nI WILL BE BACK!!","We ate here last evening and there were four of us.  We all had one thing different and we can honestly say it was \" the best\" Mexican food we have ever had.   The service was excellent, too!","Went with the family and had a good meal.  My sister wanted bowls of sour cream for the chips, and they promptly brought them for her.  The service in general was excellent.\n\nHad the cheese enchiladas platter and it was very good.  The bean dip, salsa, and chips went great with the Corona beer.","Garcia's earns 1 star  because there was one person at the table who enjoyed the meal. Garcia's is definitely not gluten free friendly inspite of the so-called gluten free menu which I can almost recall by heart it is so short. Chicken Gasedo  (shredded chicken in soup bowl one of my tablemates called chicken slop) Beef Machaco, see chicken description, Veggies, Salsa, Black beans or charro beans, house salad with vinegar and oil. So for $9.99 I got a bowl of chicken slop and a cup of black beans. I thought when I got the bill I would be charged ala carte for both items but I wasn't. So don't know if the waiter didn't charge me or what. Word to the wise at Garcia's, add some corn tortillas, maybe keep a bag of tostitos in the kitchen.","I'm a man who loves Mexican food, but I was not a fan of Garcia's. The restaurant and staff were fine but the food was not. When the food came out almost everything was burnt. It probably would have tasted fine otherwise but my meal was not.","So last night we ventured out to Garcia's for my favorite dish.. pollo Monterrey..  I love that dish,  well, I did.. they changed the recipe, some red pesto and too many tomatoes, very watery.   Didn't taste good and presentation was awful, just thrown on the plate. bartender informed me they changed food vendors so the food changed.. obviously not home made.   Very,  very disappointed.","Every time I ate at Garcia's, I got sick.  The last time I ate there, my appendix burst. No joke. A few years after my near-fatal experience, a friend of mine ate there and the next day her appendix burst!\n\n Avoid this restaurant like the plague.   Unless you enjoy going septic, that is.","You can't beat the Kids Eat Free on Sundays.  I can bring my three kids and they have lunch (more than they can eat) and a drink. My husband and I order off the lunch menu- a combo with rice and beans and with tax the bill comes to $18.\n\nThe problem is the yucky water- so any drink I try... water obviously or iced tea or soda tastes moldy/bad.\n\nThe free chips with salsa and bean dip is my favorite part. \n\nSpinach Enchilada- good\nChile Relleno- okay\nCharro Beans- okay\nSpanish Rice- yucky (though really it has to be awesome for me to like it at all)\n\nIf I didn't have 3 kids eating free I wouldn't eat here.","Canned food & terrible drinks.","I've had margaritas at hundreds of restaurants, and the house margarita at Garcia's was by far the WORST one I've ever had.  So bad, in fact, that I didn't even finish it.....and that's never happened before.  It tasted more like a lime popsicle....that supposedly had tequila in it.\n\nThe spinach queso was good, as well as the chips.  Salsa was mild.....bland.  It took our waiter well over 5 minutes to take our drink order, but service improved after that.\n\nAll in all, probably won't be going back.","Garcia's is alright. Nothing special, just kind of blah food. Not bad though if you are happen to be close by. This would not be on the top of my recommendation list.","Good food. Was here for lunch. It was slow but the service was ok and she was nice. There are lunch specials here to until 3pm. Cheese enchiladas were good. Fabulous been and salsa dip!","My husband and I go to this Garcia's about once a week. The previous reviewer mentioned the food is spicy. I don't know what the food in VA is like, but Garcia's is extremely mild in my opinion. I grew up in Cali and have lived in AZ for the past 8 years so I grew up on Mexican food and love spicy foods. The salsa is extremely mild, much more sweet than spicy. And the bean dip? Very tasty but certainly not spicy. As far as Mexican food goes, Garcia's is right there alongside most Mexican restaurant chains. The reason I love them so much is their fajitas!! The marinade they use for the chicken is the best I have ever tasted. It is really the only thing I ever order there anymore. Another great thing about Garcia's is they have 2 \"healthy\" dishes available for people who are watching their waistlines. I have had both (Grilled Chicken Flautas and a Chicken and Spinach Quesadilla) and both are pretty good for lower calorie fair.\n\nI would certainly recommend this Garcia's. Service is almost always good, it's never too crowded and the food is not bad and very affordable.","The beans aren't that great.  The only thing I get here which I think is great is the pollo fundido.  I have also had the tortilla soup which was quite tasty as well, and on a surprising note, their fries are awesome, but the burgers only so so.....pollo fundido with fries....hmmmm.  I go here about once a  year.","We went to Garcia's for a dinner.  Our party was large---6 adults, 2 toddlers and a newborn.  The restaurant gladly accomodated us.  They had high chairs for the toddlers but no sling for the baby carrier.  However, that was resolved by putting the baby carrier on a chair.\n\nThe restaurant is typical of Mexican restaurants in that they bring out the tortilla chips and salsa.  What was different, however, is that in addition to the salsa, a bean dip is also brought out.  Both were quite spicy---not spicy enough to burn your mouth but still noticeable.\n\nThe portions for the main courses were huge.  I ordered a make your own combo platter with a chile relleno and a shredded beef taco.  The taco was good.  The chile relleno was unusual in that it was the spiciest one I've ever had!   Chile rellenos are--as a rule-- a mild dish.  I asked others in our party what they thought about their meals and they, too, found theirs to be spicier than usual.  \n\nService was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and patient.  We would go again next time we're in town but now know to expect food that's uniformly spicier than usual.","One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants around. Awesome chips ad salsa, great environment and great nice and friendly service. Food comes out fast and fresh, no complaints at all. Favorite meal is the burrito meal that is covered with cheese and sour cream and awesome tender juicy chicken inside burrito. Highly recommended Garcia's!! Can't go wrong","Gross, microwaved food, slow service, cheap salsa, beans are watery mess. Bean dip is awfull.  Much better places then this place, go somewhere else for mexican, taco bell would be better.","I used to love Garcia's. Then after 2 really bad experiences (we are talking raw chicken bad), I didn't go for close to 3 years. Decided to go back about 4 months ago because I had a coupon and was hoping they had fixed the problems. Now after 3 visits, I can say they are back!!! I always get the Pollo Fundido. Chicken wrappted in jalapeno cream cheese and deep fried. YUM! I love their chips and salsa and bean dip that they serve. The service has been great each time since we started going back. There are usually $5 off coupons out there which is a great added bonus. They have great fajitas as well but I have a hard time straying from my pollo fundido! I am so happy they are back to really good food and service. Reasonable prices as well!","We called ahead for a reservation for 7 and when we arrived we were able to get seated right away which was great. The staff was friendly our only complaint would be that the food took FOREVER to come out so we went through a few bowls of chips while waiting.","If you're looking for good Mexican food, keep looking.  This place served me some of the worst Chile Colorado that I've ever had, despite the server telling me it was \"really good\".  The chips are bad (light, cheap, flavorless), the salsa is over salted and generally no better than your average grocery brand.  The Chile. . .  I don't even have the words - too salty to eat - but even barring that it was beef chunks in a brown gravy (!) with a nice film forming on it.  The flavor was shallow, dull, thick and generally poor.  I took literally one bite, asked for the check, paid and left.\n\nThe rest of the experience was fine.  Cleanliness, service, etc are certainly within acceptable margins for a chain restaurant.  Some people are passionate about food.  These people are not.  If you are, you'd be much better served at a place like Casa Ramos which is about a block away.","My husband and I came in here late one night, close to closing time, and we still had amazing service. We were treated like we were valuable customers, even though it was late & the staff probably wanted to go home. I got the mini chimis & my hubby got the chili relleno. I'm a Mexican food junkie & this is pretty dang good!","Came here with the In-law family for a group dinner on a wedding weekend. Food was quite tasty and servings were just plain obnoxiously large. When I come back through, I'll make sure we make this a stop.","Came here for dinner and everything was good. The pollo fundido came out hot and fresh, the tortilla soup was better than expected, and the chips and salsa did not disappoint. The only problem was that the chiles rellenos came out soggy and actually overstuffed with cheese(I know, usually a good problem). Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and our waitress was attentive and friendly, so I'll definitely be back.","1. Good Customer Service\n2. Clean Atmosphere\n3. Good Margaritas\n4. YUMMIE Carna Asada Burrito","Found this gem when the other mexican restaurant down the street was closed. We got soft drinks and chips with salsa & AMAZING bean dip to start out with. As an app we ordered the Cheese Crisp and got the beef Chimichanga! Our server was hysterical and checked on us frequently. This was a great place and I would love to go back!","We were dissapointed.  We wanted to eat outside and were told to seat ourselves.  We did and found that there was food encrusted on the table tops and several tables had not been cleared.  \nWe went back inside and though the service was adequate, the food was bland and uninteresting.","We stopped going to Garcia's for a long time after a few bad experiences. We had raw chicken once, wrong orders once, etc. So after close to a year, my daughter talked me into giving them a try again since they were once a favorite. Well....They are BACK! It was really good again. I love that they bring out bean dip and salsa. I don't like beans but it is a nice touch. The pollo fundido was amazing like it used to be. Great rice, great salsa, great service. They have coupons regularly in the paper as well. The manager was going around asking everyone how their service and food was which I always appreciate. We will be back and soon! Glad they have hopefully fixed the problems they were having!","Eric !!!!!! is amazing! My husband and I asked our server for the name of the guy that was buzzing all over the place, working like a slave - nonstop - constantly smiling, happy, asking if anyone needed anything, bringing refills, greeting people, clearing tables ..... he was absolutely the most wonderful, friendly,  helpful personality in the place!!  BEST service of any eating establishment we've been to in this area. Five star !!!!!!!!!!","Disgruntled and uninterested is the best description I can give to the services provided by the bartender/waitress at this location of Garcia's.  I was sadly disappointed.   Maybe you'll be more fortunate if you come at a different time.  I showed up for happy hour on a Tuesday at 3pm.  The food was decent but not good enough to overshadow the unhappy, unfriendly server.","The service was great! Walked in, saw empty space at the far end of the bar, went over to find that the space was empty because there were no chairs there but within seconds one of the guys/manager(?) was carrying over 2 chairs for us to use!  Then within seconds of sitting down we had someone delivering chips, salsa and bean/dip.  Then came the friendly bartender service (Adam), who informed us of their happy hour and 1/2 price happy hour app specials, etc.   We ordered the chicken/steak combo fajitas and added a cup of the tortilla soup to it. The soup came out first and was hot and had lots of chunks of chicken in it! We were not disappointed.  You can't beat that for an extra $2.50! The fajitas came out sizzling (just the way we like them) and were cooked perfectly. There was a lot of meat - more than you usually get on combo fajitas.  We really liked the atmosphere and with service and food backing it up - we'll go back and tell our friends!","The worst \"mexican\" food i have ever had. The portions were enormous but so bad. The steak in my quesadilla was tough and didn't taste good at all. I will never go back.","This is another location I have visited many times and every time I received great service and ate great food without fail. The food is cheap and the atmosphere is descent. Bonus points go to the excellent Fried Ice Cream!","Ate at Garcias a few times over the years.  Up until tonight, it has always been a dependable place to get some good food with some good service.  We arrived later in the night and the place was maybe 40% full, but still had to stand up front waiting for anybody to greet us or seat us for a few minutes.  \n\nI ordered an iced tea that ended up tasting odd to me, but the server was nice about getting me something different.  However, the half drank tea cup remained on the table, stacked on two small dirty plates and were still on the table when we left.  \n\nThe salsa and beans (which every table gets) were eaten quickly, but we were never asked if we would like more. Several tables around me were asked several times if they would like more.  The food was tasty and the restaurant was clean.","I had some friends here visiting Saturday and BRAGGED about this place. I was very disappointed. The waitress greeted us almost immediately and yet it took 20 minutes to get a glass of water, followed by cold bean dip. An hour before our drinks finally came. When the food finally came out EVERYTHING was cold, all 4 of our platters. None of ate we all asked for boxes and then gave our boxed food to a peddling Bum outside the front door asking for money.\n\nI doubt I will ever go back again, what a shame... I was a waitress once, I would have asked if something was wrong if I had a 4 top and nobody touched it !!","I had the sampler plate sunday Fathers Day\nit was so good\nlittle chimis beans polla fundidos...so delicious.\nThe help is awesome awesome-we love Bryan and Kylie.\nUsually sit on the patio but it was hot and windy last sunday.\nTry it-you will like it.","Our waiter was very nice and very attentive and there was also a very nice woman who made sure we never ran out of chips, salsa, or bean dip. The food was good, not great but good. My husband had the El Magnifico Sampler, I had the Olivia's Sampler, and our son had the Mini Tacos and Chimis off the Kid's Menu. It was all good and we all had leftovers for the next two days. We also had a couple of margaritas which were very big and good as well. We did have water and luckily I asked for lemon in mine. My husband took one sip and said, \"Ugh that is Mesa tap water for sure.\" I really think they should invest in a water filtration system and their rating would go up by at least one star.","Ive been here on multiple occasions and I have never been fully satisfied. The wait staff is poor. On one visit, two other couples had been seated and received their drinks before we even saw our waitress. Another time, we were the only ones in the restaurant and still waited 10 minutes before we saw our waitress to ask for the check. \n\nThe food: It comes out fast which is kind of scary. It makes me think that they are just popping in the microwave. I watch a lot of kitchen nightmares :-p\n\nThe chips and dip served when you arrive is more filling than the food to be honest. \n\nI liked the margaritas...Good pricing!\n\nFinally the best part: The chocolate mini chimis.","Wow. I am extremely surprised how many bad reviews this place has, considering we've been here a handful of times and we have never gotten food poisoning or bad service... hmmmmmm..\n\nFirst time we came here, it was a hit for me.\nI got the chimichanga with refried beans and rice. And a house salad with ranch. Kris likes their enchiladas and burritos, everything was super good and delicious.\n\nThe service is usually on top of things, except that the 2nd time we went, the waiter completely forgot my salad and margarita, but brought it after I mentioned it- which came after the dinner. Bleh. Plus they got me shredded beef instead of grounded beef in my burrito like I have asked. They offered to redo it, but I was too hungry and said that was not necessary.. I just didn't want to be eating someone else's burrito. And the Pineapple margarita that I ordered looked nothing like the menu picture, was not even pineapple-flavored either.\n\nThe manager comped the burrito off the bill, but kinda wished he would have comped the drink and salad. Oh well. \n\nI guess it's a hit or miss for some people, I'll give Garcia's the benefit of the doubt for that bad night and give'em a 4 star for now.","I've been here twice and have had a decent experience both times. The menu is large with a lot of different choices and reasonably priced. Kids eat for .99 on Sundays which is always a good thing.\n\nWe went this past Sunday and were seated promptly. There were a lot of people dining but a good amount of open tables left. Our server came over quickly (do not recall his name) and took our drink order. When he came back to take our food order he came across like he was paying attention but got a few things wrong. Not usually a big deal if it's something that can be corrected, but he had to be reminded. When the manager came by to ask how everything was (toward the end of the meal) we let him know that the kid's meals were incorrect but they had eaten more than half. He offered free dessert but we were stuffed.\n\nI ordered the pollo fundidto and it was alright. The cream cheese didn't have much spice like I expected it to. My husband was happy with his fish tacos and his mom loved the carnitas tacos. The chips, salsa, and bean dip prior to the meal was good and of course I made the mistake of eating too much. \n\nI love that Garcia's is just down the street so we will definitely be back...but probably just on Sundays.","I don't get to visit the Mesa location often but it has been worth it each time I go. The food is still just as good along with the service. We came in for lunch on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy at all. The server was very helpful and attentive. Love Garcias one of the best Mexican food places for Fajitas, hands down!"],"business_id":"_mt0EQgGCG-qrLy51RnQag","name":"Garcia's Mexican Restaurant","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["The food here was great! I had received a recommendation for Macayo's from my hotel....everything was exactly as he raved about. The place is spacious and bright....the chips and salsa were plentiful and extremely addicting....the service was exceptional. I chose their recommendation (Macayo Chimichanga) which was excellent and I would definitely go back! If you love mexican food, this is a great pick!","Macayo's is a not-very-authentic Mexican restaurant that is great for my family who likes not-very-authentic Mexican food.  I like going here when I visit Phoenix because they have a beef taco with shredded beef instead of ground beef which is found too frequently at other restaurants.  Also one time they accidentally deep fried my whole bean burro which turned out awesome and now I order it that way every time.\n\nI was surprised how bad their house margarita was...I always see people returning with their Macayo's margarita mugs to party the night away.  I had a stomache after finishing that off.\n\nMany years ago we'd visit for Sunday brunch which had a breakfast buffet with a huge selection of breakfast Mexican food.","Great food.","Finally...a Mexican chain restaurant that I really like! I was weary about trying macayos at first (I can't stand arribas or on the border and thought this would be the same), but I'm so glad I gave it a shot. The food is really good and the drinks are strong, so you feel like you are getting your moneys worth. However it is 2$ for a small side of sour cream and I find that a little insane. The waiters were all really nice and we all enjoyed our food, this is now one of our regular dining places.","The service was excellent.  The food was good.","Delicous Mexican food at a great price! Love the green chili tamales and chicken chimichangas! Endless chips and salsa are delicious as well.","Wasn't busy but had to wait a little. Food was a little cold on my fiance and son's plate but was discounted. My food came out awesome.","If you like AUTHENTIC Mexican food, don't bother.  If you don't know the difference you'll probably be ok.  My feeling is that it is totally \"sanitized\" with little to no soul.  It's overpriced as well.","Stay far far away from here unless you like food that comes out of a can into the microwave and onto your plate. I couldn't eat my meal at all, I had a chicken chimichanga that came out soggy there was so much water left in the chicken. I tried to eat the chicken but it was nasty and fatty. The rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle. Even the booth we where set at was dirty and had holes in the vinyl.  I will never go back.","Update: Management called to appologize for all th RATS running around and said he'd send me a coupon for our next visit. It never came. Surprised? Not really.\n    \nRATS!!! The wife and I stopped for quatro de Mayo and were halfway through our Quesadilla when I looked to my left and a BIG rat was sitting under the table next to us. As soon as i made a gesture towards him he ran back into the outdoor stainless bar/storage or whatever it is. OK, she was freaked out but I said, \"hey, we're on the patio so &%#$ happens and told the waitress when she came back who was also a bit freaked out especially when I told her how big it was. This was no freakin' mouse. A few minutes later our food came out and as we were engaged in the act of eating... here came another big freaking rat who ran right under our table and out hole in the wall. I once again told the server who was a bit freaked out and started looking around as she went back to wherever she came from. Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road. I've been frequenting Macayo's for years but this and the fact that the food quality isn't consistent has ensured we won't frequent this establishment any time soon. We also planm to let everyone we know about this. I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few people","Macayo's offers a broad selection of Mexican favorites like enchiladas, burritos, chimis, etc.  I had a chicken chimi and it was very flavorful.  The salsa is delicious with just enough heat. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is enormous, but the interior decor is interesting to say the least.  It is overly bright inside, like a Mexican Denny's.  There are fake animals everywhere and enough fake plants to make Rainforest Cafe jealous. Overall this is just an average Mexican restaurant in a town full of great Mexican restaurants.","I will just hit the highlights: \n\nOrdered the carne asada chimichanga with rice & beans. All of my food was room temperature when it came out. As a side note, I've never seen carne asada meat cut so big. They were each sized like pieces you'd cut off a steak. \n\nAfter forcing down half of the chimi I sent the entire plate back to the kitchen. Ultimately it was removed from our bill. \n\nThe waitress brought one of their regular heavy-bottomed glasses to the table for my 6-year old. She also filled my drink so full that it dribbled all over the table as she was handing it across to me instead of walking to my side and setting it down. \n\nThe sopapillas were flat, thick, and very bubbly like fry bread, not light and thin with one big pocket on the inside.","RATS!!! See the manager's 'appology' , Hell,he didn't even visit our table on our less than acceptable experience and he never followed up on his promise via e-mail to take care of us with a discount next time we come in. We still haven't received anything even though I gave him our address. Apparently they could care less although they feel a need to do the requisite \"lip service\" giving the illusion they are concerned. I've been coming here since they opened the Ahwatukee location and it was a favorite haunt for drinks after hitting 18 at Ahwatukee CC. No more for me, my family and anyone else I remember to tell about our experience","I have been going to Macayo's for years and they have some delicious mexican food. My personal favorite is the chimichanga, which is amazing. I have a hard time ordering anything else because it is perfect. My wife tried the chili relleno last time and that was delicious as well. I've had many different things here and have never been disappointed. Their free chips and salsa are delicious too. I can't find a single complaint.","This Macayo's is just like every other Macayo's except they have the slowest service in the world.\n\nStandard chain Mexican food. I normally get the California burrito and an Iced tea. Nothing overly spectacular. Actually, the chips and salsa are really good.\n\nDo not come here if you are in a rush because you will be anxiously shifting in your seat waiting for your check at the end of your meal.","I like the location and the bar area and the little patio, it's relaxing.  Service was very good.\n\nNow for the food yikes:\n\nChips and salsa, chips are good and light and thin.  Salsa is watery and has no flavor, the hotter salsa was a bit thicker and tasted better.\n\nOrdered like someone else mentioned, the carna asada chimi.  It was huge but I also got the thick chunks of meat inside, I've never seen carne asada look like that.  The worst part is the chimi was very salty.  The rice had no flavor either, so overall it was horrible, and it was expensive.\n\nI'm hard pressed to order any food again, possibly just drinks and hang out.","I went to the mesa location a few months ago but don't remember ever coming to this location. We had an in-service day at work so we had an extra long lunch. So me and some coworkers decided to head over here. Great choice. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but their chimis are great. I got the shredded beef one this time. So good. I love them. There is a reason it is their specialty. If you go to a steak house you don't order the chicken or go to a sushi place and order a hamburger. So if it the specialty why get anything else.\nMy girlfriend loves Macayo's too so we will definitely be back. So will my coworkers if we have another long lunch.","Tried it yesterday, because Los Dos Molinos was closed and I wanted to try a new Mexican place.  The service was good.  The margarita was decent.  I tried the carnitas.  Bland.  The beans were terrible.  The food was subpar.","Finally got back around to this lovely Macayo's, joined today by Mike C. & Jackie C.  I went with a \"Mex & Match\" Lunch Special, which gives lots of choices.  Mine came with Tortilla Soup, followed by a big (Pablano) Chile Relleno, steamed veggies and a shredded beef taco, plus a little bit of salad, unlimited tasty chips, their excellent chunky red salsa.\n\nThis was a really good lunch with great table service by Kyle and priced right at $9.99.     :-))","Ate here on Saturday.  The good news was that the service by Jon was off the chart good. The chips and salsa were great and my wife's carne asada tacos looked and tasted good.  The beans and rice were fine.  I got a carne asada chimichanga smothered in a cheese and spinach sauce.  The bad moment for me was when I was down to my last bite and I suddenly realized there had been way too much fat in my chimi.  So I tried to pull out the fat from my last bite by removing a suspect piece of meat, and when I took the last bite it was all fat and that grossed me out.  Technically my wife and I had the same ingredients, but in retrospect I realized that since you can't see what's in a chimi when it is smothered, they dumped in fat scraps, and that makes me mad.  It wasn't just a little fat, it was like every 2nd or 3rd bite was dominated by it.  Lame.  If do go back, I'll be sure to get meat that I can see.  Maybe that is why people always order fajitas at Mexican places.","OK but would not choose it over other great restaurants in the area. Portions are good, but the food did not taste fresh the taquitos, were dripping from lard just not appealing.","Love to eat cheese enchiladas and have a margarita here. I used to live in Tucson, so when I visit family in Phoenix I try to get a visit here. One time my enchiladas were cold and I ate the beans and rice which were piping hot. I brought it to the wait staff attention and they brought me a whole new plate!!!","The service was great, but the food is way average. If you're looking for good Mexican food this is not the place. This is a large chain that bastardizes Mexican food.","I've been a longtime fan of Macayo's so I decided to finally write a review for them. I came here last Friday (7/29/11) for a Birthday dinner and as usual the service and food were stellar. It was really packed on Friday night yet the team still manage to efficiently serve my party of 8 as well as bring out our orders in a timely fashion. My favorites here are the Taquitos enchilada style and if you don't mind calories the Baja Chimi is delicious (one of my favorite guilty pleasures!).  Everything comes with free chips and salsa (there are two or three different salsas, make sure to ask for the spicy one if you're into heat!). Really good Happy Hour too! I haven't been to any other Macayo's location so I am only speaking on behalf of this Ahwatukee location.","Came here for date night last night and it was amazing. We got sat right away and our server brought us our chips and salsa and our drink orders almost right away. We ordered and our food was hot and amazing! The only thing I would complain about would be our server being too attentive. I mean it isn't bad it showed he cared but we saw him at our table every 7-10 minutes. \nOther than that. Everything about this place is great! Fast and great food","My family and I love Macayos, we eat at the Tempe location all to time. We came her for a quick lunch and ended up staying much longer than anticipated. The food was delicious like usual, the fried ice cream is great! But the service was terrible. We waited forever to get our food, even though there were only a few people there. We will not be eating at this location again.","Very rarely do I find a restaurant that does not change it's taste and menu over the years. Macayo's must know a good thing when they have it, I have never had a meal that has been removed from the menu and if you need something changed about it they are more then willing to fix it to your liking. The endless chips and salsa are always great but their sauces make their entrees better then ever! Yay for baja sauce! I will continue to go back for years to come!","Stopped in for dinner tonight and was greeted promptly And seated very quickly. My waiter was awesome, took our order, got the drinks out and brought us the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh but what in the hell happened to the salsa?!?  \n\nThe salsa looked and tasted like it was 90% tomato paste, 5% chopped veggies, 5% liquid.  The salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless. I inquired about the flavor and texture and he mentioned they recently changed the recipe. He asked if we'd like to try the spicier salsa, said it might be better. \n\nThe spicier salsa was brought out and it wasn't much better. Instead of tomato paste it tasted like a chipotle BBQ sauce. \n\nThe food was super quick coming out which was awesome, however the awesome ended there.  The chicken tortilla soup was more like a salty stew, the trio enchilada plate looked good but the rice was mushy and flavorless, the cheese in top if the Baja sauce was dried out and the pork was chewy and included pieces of fat and tendon. About the best thing in that plate was the black beans \n\nThe carnitas chimmy was so so, the meat was flavorless like it was boiled. \n\nThe chicken in the chicken cilantro lime Caesar salad tasted like it was boiled then lightly grilled.  The lettuce and dressing were pretty good though. \n\nThe tamale bites tasted like deep fried Mac and cheese bite with green chili in them. \n\nWe have our waiter out feedback and again he mentioned the kitchen changed the menu and recipes. We asked for the manager and Maria came out and we gave her the same feedback. She too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes. She apologized for the quality and taste if the food and comp'd half if the meals. \n\nI understand adding new things to the menu to stay current but why change recipes?  \n\nThe 1 star given was only because of the great service and attitude of our waiter and manager.  Can't say I'll be back again, at least not until they fix the recipes and go back to using quality ingredients and improve in their food qualities.","I have been to Macayo's restaurant before but this time, I feel that I must comment.  The food was excellent at the Ahwatukee setting but it was provided by an even greater asset, the server Rafael.   He was courteous, attentive and respectful.  It was a great pleasure to have him at our table.","So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision. \n\nPerhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful. \n\nBetween my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either). \n\nOur server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.\n\nIf you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.\n\nI will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe.","Best salsa in AZ!  And the chicken baja burrito is indescribable!  I'm a native and Macayo's is top 5 in the state.","I have been to this Macayo's quite a bit. The enchilada sampler is probably my favorite item on the menu, but don't expect too much. For being an Americanized version of an already inaccurate cuisine, this place is pretty good.\n\nI do, however, very much enjoy the refillable Senor Bob margarita mug.","Delicious, one of the best mexican food places around.\nGreat chips and salsa for free and the shredded beef chimichanga is incredible!!","I am sure just about everyone has been to a Macayos.. it is your typical Mexican fare.  I come here for lunch a lot and I like it because it is fast for a sit down lunch... you are out of there in under a hour.  I always get their original Mexican pizza (not the baja one)... it is good and something like $6.00.  So while I am not going to rave about Macayos to my friends and tell them they need to try this place it is a good lunch destination.","HMMMM......still no option for zero stars??? well I wish i could give a better review, but it's hard to when you NEVER get greeted!!! LOL So i'll try.....this was the first time i've ever gotten up and walked out of a restaurant. My wife wanted to stay and complain, but we were both pretty hungry already and didnt really want to wait around to talk to some 'Joe Shmoe' Manager, who obviously doesn't give a crap about service and hospitality.\n\nWe walked in at about 8:15-8:20pm lastnight, no hostess, nobody there to greet us. Stood there for about 4-5min, finally a girl walks by and asks, \"oh do you need a table?\"\n\nSo at this point, a little annoyed, but oh well they must have cut the hostess early that night? Start looking at the menu, a couple minutes go by, still no server. We see a couple different servers walk by our table and glance at us but just ignored us. So i guess those servers were all cut? or it wasnt their turn? \n\nWe both knew that they didnt have the full staff of servers on still, but you'd think somebody would eventually greet us.\n\nSo we finish looking at the menu, sat there for another couple minutes. Saw another 2 different servers walk by us and talk to the two booths on both sides of us to ask how things were, and both walked away without talking to us.\n\nI could understand maybe miscommunication, or if we had beverage napkins down already, or if we had walked over from the bar and already had drinks, maybe everyone who walked by us just assumed we had already been helped....\nbut NO!! nothing! we had nothing infront of us, other than 2 folded up menus that we both had read over almost 4 times!! LOL\n\nThen there was one busser that walked by and kind of glanced at us after we had been there for 5 mintues and he could tell something was up. But still nothing.\n\nThen i turned to my wife and said, \"ok lets just go, this is garbage.\" we were both kind of hesitant about walking about, because we had never done it, but this was a joke! she asked are you sure? should we say something? i said, \"to who? nobody is stopping at our table to greet us, just get up, follow me, lets go.\"\n\nSo as we were sliding out of the booth, we left the menus on the table, nobody tried to stop us or ask us what was wrong, obviously nobody cared. Headed to the exit, right past the host stand. Noticed there were 3 girl servers just hanging out kind of off to the side of the host stand, but still in front for everyone to see. Just chatting with themselves, all of them messing with their phones, one girl had her purse on so she must have been leaving soon. All 3 girls were oblivious and watched us walk out.\n\nNow i've been going to Macayo's since i was 12, back when there was only one location over in mesa, then the one in downtown tempe, and been coming to this location since it opened back when i was in high school. Now the tempe location is great, still go there, the patio is cool, never had a problem there. \n\nBut here, this garbage ahwatukee location, yea its gotten to that point now, garbage. It started off good when it first opened about 10 years ago. But over the years this location has reeeeaaallly dropped off. Not so much the food, dont get me wrong the food has still been consistantly good, but the service over the years! BLEH!!! just like the 17 different times they've re-painted the outside of the restaurant!!!  LOL\n I know management and staffs change over the years, but you can really tell that they dont care anymore.\n\nSo anyone in the ahwatukee area if you're in the mood for mexican food dont even consider Macayo's on 48th & Warner. You'd be better off going to the Taco Bell right there for better service. Or just down 48th street to chandler for Arriba's(which is where we ended uo going).","I've had an excellent experience at one Macayo's (Central Av, Phx) & an awful one at another (Ash Av, Tempe), so I didn't really know what to expect here, today.  Here's how it went:\n\nStarting off, they brought me plenty of chips.  They were warm & tasty, & the salsa mild but good.  (When the salsa ran low, my server offered me some more.)\n\nThe \"Mex & Match\" area of the weekday menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices, all the same price each, & one or two of a good number of side dish selections, all the same price each.  It's easy to get a meal of exactly what you want from this menu!\n\nI ordered a Chile Relleno & a Shredded Beef Taco for my main items, & Steamed Vegetables & Albondigas Soup for my sides this time.  For the vegetables, they serve you a bunch of different, buttery bite-sized veggie pieces, cooked just right.  The soup was delicious, too.  The Pablano Chile Relleno was a little mild for my taste, but it was BIG, & very well prepared, with plenty of Oaxaca cheese inside.  The shredded beef taco was large too, with plenty of meat, & delicious.  Another thing was that the attractive presentation on the platter & the hot platter itself were both really nice, like something out of an ad where they took all day to prep & photo it!\n\nThis location looks new, & it's VERY nice inside!  It was cold outside, & I landed a comfortable booth near the fire in the fireplace!  My service, from Alex, was friendly & attentive, too.\n\nThis \"Mex & Match\" Lunch Special is available Monday through Friday 11-4.  I went with the most expensive combination, 2 main items & 2 sides, & it was $8.49.\n\nA LOT of attention to detail has gone into the layout & decor of this restaurant, as well as to the menu, the  preparation of the food, & the presentation of it.  I think there's enough \"specialness\" here for this Macayo's to deserve 5 Stars!     :-))","I don't know what has happened to this formerly tasty and satisfying restaurant, but things definitely seem to have fallen way below par in terms of taste, quality, and price. I ordered the cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and beans combination plate and was very disappointed to see that the beans were microwaved while the rest of the food lacked flavor. The staff is usually always nice at this location, but the food just isn't worth it anymore. Maybe it's different at different locations, but the only tasty food still left here are the chips and salsa.","Ugh, what a waste.  I know that this place is beloved by many, but really and truly this is straight up, flavorless Mexican chain food with some hatch chilies arbitrarily thrown in at times.  It's a total study in mediocrity, from the bland salsa to the weak margaritas.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos all left me snoozing.  They get a star for their commemorative mugs (hilarious!) and another for their exceptionally wonderful servers (very sweet and attentive) but that's where it ends.  I can't believe this was the place that the President ate at when he came to visit - I'm joining the throngs of people in the valley that swear against this place.  Like Tim Meadows in Dewey Cox \"You don't want no part of this!\"","I come here maybe once a month or so, I find that the wait staff is for the most part friendly, but two that stand out as what true customer service is about. They are Mike ( he's a new dad) and a young lady Ashley. Both work hard to cater to our needs without being bothersome. A rare combo in the food service world. Great food and if I were you ask for mike or Ashley's station.","My first time at this location, and if the food weren't actually pretty good, I would have rated it a one.\n\nWe visited during a lunch hour on Saturday, and I wouldn't have thought the amount of business justified a waiter taking literally a few minutes to get our drink order. In fact, I think ours was the only table in the section with customers seated. I was tolerant of this initial slowness thinking it would get better from there, but it never did. Every step required an extended wait right up to getting my check. The waiter didn't even check in on us while we were eating. When I got up to go to the bathroom after the check had been presented suddenly the waiter was there to get his money. And this is the ONLY time I've been asked for my ID with my credit card at a restaurant. \n\nSome might defend that as a necessary and even nice security step given the world we live in today, etc. But if left a bad taste in my mouth. A restaurant shouldn't be doing this. I had just spent over $100 for a dinner and drinks in a far nicer place in Denver, and wasn't asked for an ID.\n\nSo overall, a decent place with good food who needs to manage their help a lot better, and stop asking for ID from customers paying with credit cards.","It is truly sick that my boyfriend knows where all the Macayo's are located in the valley and has visited all but one. \n\nBefore I started dating him, I had visited the Depot Cantina in 1997 (yes I remember the year, it was a traumatic event) and HATED the food. I ordered tacos (how can you go wrong, oh you can) and they tasted horrible. I vowed to never visit Macayo's again. I had stayed true to my promise for a good 10 years before my boyfriend informed me that this was one of his favorite restaurants (I think he was testing our relationship) and invited me to dinner here. Well I came back and it wasn't as bad as I remembered it. I pretty much always order the shredded beef Baja Chimi, the sauce give it just a small kick. I can't take much. Sometimes I'll get the mini chimi appetizer plate and that's good too. I can't remember if it comes with 6 or 8 chimis. With their Chimi Fiesta going on I get the mini chimi sampler which comes with 6 chimis . There are 2 of three different kinds: chicken, beef, and pork each with it's own sauce on top. And it's only $6! The margaritas here are also pretty good. My favorite it the frozen strawberry. It hits the spot on a warm (ok scorching hot) AZ day. \n\nI've never sat in the restaurant area in this location. The bar has plenty of booths and the servers know us now and are always on top of our order. \n\nI do like patio at the Dobson and Baseline location better because it's \"lakeview\" dining. :p But the service at the Ahwatukee location can't be beat.","Perfect Combination!\n\nMargaritas, salty chips, and fresh salsa . . . what could be better than that?  Add in 1/2 price appetizers for happy hour and you might have an answer.  The Beef Taquitos were the perfect combination of crispy and soft and the baja pizza was pretty good too!","NEVER AGAIN!! Our group of thirteen; two five, one seven, one 11, well behaved! Two star food, 2  1/2  star service. Food $160.71 tax $13.33 = $174.04 AND $29.00 (18%) tip, yikes! = $203.00. If the food and service is 4, 5, star, 18% is cheap. The worst thing, this dump was my idea, every one else wanted to go to Olive Garden. Never got a bad meal there.

{"reviews":["grilled fish tacos with shredded cabbage were quite good, for food in an airport..","Passing through Phoenix airport and ordered a vegetarian bowl.  It cost more than $8 and I left a tip.  Opened the bowl to find about 1/3 cup of rice and 1/3 cup of black beans, plus a sprinkle of fajitas and a tablespoon of sour cream and tablespoon of guacamole.  In other words, it was very, very little food for the price I paid.  Also it was quite greasy and over-salted.  \n\nAirport food, sigh.","I waited for about 5 min at the bar which didn't even have a bartender behind it. When the bartender arrived, she pleasantly took my drink order, but then helped two ppl after me (poured a soda for a kid at the bar and then closed out a check). It's not like airport bars are amazing, but this level of service was pretty poor. Oh well, beer in hand now : )","5 stars for a few reasons. Awesome beer selection and I have 3 hours to kill. The food is well above average airport fare. If you have some time and need a good beer come here. Gate C12. It's worth it.","Zero service. Food is given in take out containers. Nachos are served with fake cheese and they do not have jalapeños.","Better than average airport food. I had breakfast tacos. I wish they had cooked the bacon more but I enjoyed the mix of flavors. \n\nThey serve a good beer selection in red solo cups. Also have PHX local beer Kilt Lifter","Chicken burrito.  Chicken boiled more than grilled.  Strange mini rice, but had black beans.  Corona light on tap!","This place is great. Beer is served only in red Solo cups just like a proper dive bar. Build your own burritos, fish tacos. All good. Hey you're in an airport, set expectations accordingly! Love this place","We stopped in for a quick beer before our flight. The bar features a large beer selection at pretty reasonable prices. They were served in red solo cups, which was a little odd, but kind of fun at the same time. We ordered from the counter as the bar was full. The beers came quick and the staff was friendly. We didn't try the food, but it looked good and was reasonably priced. We will definitely be back.","Dropped into Sir Veza's Taco Garage on Thanksgiving morning with my family on the way out to California. Did not eat anything; this was about some liquid holiday cheer! \n\nEverything is served in Red Solo cups to keep track on who has a beverage, if ya catch my drift. \n\nAside from the Tang, our bartender made a pretty good mimosa. Negra Modelo on tap. \n\nAlso, the guy thought I had a Minnesota accent. Too funny. At the very least, thanks for giving this Northern California lady a good laugh! \n\nPrices seemed typical for airport drinks; however, when your awesome Pops is footing the bill . . . Who cares?!","Waiting for my Southwest flight. Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced (especially for airport food). Good service and a fun atmosphere. Nothing like a Corona and a veggie bowl to relax before getting on the plane.","Huge portions and tasty stuff. Trust the bartender, she knows what to recommend.","Can only recommend this place for a great ice cold beer but nothing more. Had the Nitro Nachos...eek, me thinks not! Poor quality ingredients. If they mess up nachos with simple ingredients what other harm can they do w/ the rest of their menu. Restaurant its self needs a little sanitizing & sweeping. I would feel bad about the glass my beer came in but they serve in red solo cups. First time I'm happy to see them.","This was closest to my gate..and i was feeling hungry..so why not..\n\nI got the overpriced 2 carnitas tacos... Not legit at all..\n\nIt was just eh.....","The girl working the register was too busy talking to her coworkers to get my order right or to remember to give me the soft drink I ordered, but the  Birria burrito I got instead of the breakfast burrito I ordered was awesome. Great food, poor service.","Nice addition to the airport.  Carnitas tacos are the way to go.  Plus a nice pull up bar while waiting on a flight.  Don't forget the black beans & rice in the to go cup:)","Could have added more bacon n egg to my egg bowl. Still, loaded with flavor.","Pricey but good. The sonoran hot dog was delicious. Taco salad also a good choice.","Fish tacos were pretty tasty but came with no sauce.  Asked for green salsa and got red.  Also, it was $24 for 4 tacos","Not bad in fact good. Great service at the bar. Good food, excellent beer selection. I enjoyed the time there with a beer and quesadillas - enjoyable. Keep it up a welcome addition to sky harbor","Actually didn't try the food. Stopped into to grab something to eat after a long day of travel. Bartender closing down his register,  kitchen was getting cleaned up, waitresses were closing out and and doing side work.  When I  asked if the restaurant is still open the rude bartender pointed at the gate across from me and said when that plane leaves they close.  \n\nI walked out of there, who wants to eat at a place that is 99 percent closed down and on top of that they weren't even inviting and said hey we're closing down but don't worry about it,  come on in and grab something we will take care of you.\n\nStay open till you close.","Had the chicken tacos. They were not your ordinary tacos which was a good thing. Very good taste and only about 9 bucks. Service was quick to. Recommended","Want to know how to gross a vegetarian out? Stick a big chunk of chicken in their vegan burrito bowl. Never again!","So first off I feel it's important to say that this place is in the airport, which I feel colors the review. All in all the place is good for its location. That and the ability to leave an airport eatery with fairly interesting food and a good beer for $15 is pretty good. \n\nThe style of the place is a hipster chipotle. Flavor is pretty good and not that inventive. Options are tacos, burritos and bowls w/ the same meat options as chipotle. So why not go to chipotle?  2 reasons, 1. There isn't one and 2. The beer. Again the beer.\n\nSo they have 20 different beers on tap, locales and national micro brews. They allow taste before you buy and are pretty good. \n\n3 on its merits, 4 because of an airport.","Good food especially for an airport. Really pleased with Sky Harbor additions of Chelsea's Kitchen and Sauce. But for food next to the gate this is a viable option. Good bacon and egg breakfast tacos as well as chicken tacos for lunch. Give it a try. Cartel coffee next door also.","Ordered the fish tacos - should call it fish nugget.  For $9 - I got two bites of fish across two tacos.   Ridiculous.","They did it up on decorations, and the bartender, Natalie, was great.  Terrific for an airport bar.","I got the bowl [which comes with guacamole, blak beans, rice, salsa, cilantro, chipotle crema] and for the meats I chose Barbacoa and carnitas. I wasn't expecting much for the quantity, the quality is average. Didn't have much meat in my bowl. If you're looking for airport food that'll satisfy your hunger for an hour or two, get what I got! Good for those who don't want to be on the plane with a full stomach. =]","Here today and was treated so rude by a 40 something male bartender. \n\nWhat an idiot. Why are people mean?  There was not reason to be rude you could tell that he was often rude to people as other employee had their heads down. He was some type of manager probably sad about how his life turned out so he treats people rude because there is nowhere else to go in the airport. \n\nIf you can avoid it do not go here","I needed lunch during a layover. Unfortunately, PHX doesn't have many options. So I settled on this place. The decor was fun and the menu LOOKED good. But it is best not to judge a book by its cover. \n\nFirst, we ordered the sliders. I was starving but my wife just wanted a snack. Figuring the sliders might be enough to satisfy us both, we ordered them. You get TWO sliders for $8. They were flavorless, but not terrible.\n\nBecause that didn't satisfy my hunger, I went back and ordered the nachos. Nachos, how hard could that be? Ok, these were TERRIBLE! The cheese, wasn't cheese. And it didn't even come close to tasting like cheese. The meat certainly didn't look like meat. And the chips weren't very good either. I've never done this before, but I actually returned them. I wasn't about to pay $12 for the 2 terrible bites my wife and I took. \n\nFind another place, you won't be happy eating here.","I'm sitting a couple of feet away from Sir Veza's as I wait for my flight to board. I had some time to kill and was very interested in a drink and at this gate Sir Veza's satisfied both of those requirements. Their menu is simple, I ordered a burrito with grilled chicken and a \"sky harborita\". Their layout is kind of weird because anywhere you stand to wait for your food and drink will be blocking either people getting drinks at the bar or people behind you waiting to order. \n\nAnywho, I got my burrito and drink and after a few minutes snagged a seat at a table. The harborita did it's job for $5 and the burrito was actually pretty good. Black beans, cheese, rice, meat, and a side of chile verde which was flavorful and I'm glad I dipped my burrito in it. If the burrito ($7.95) were a dollar cheaper or a little bigger, I probably would have no complaints. This is a pretty good joint and would eat here again","I had a flight to SF that was departing from a gate near this place and wanted to grab a bite before I boarded.  It looked like a cool place and offered some menu items that looked good.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:\n\nNitro Nachos, $8.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=b0HbdLhmPl7Lmj8L7E8yJA#b0HbdLhmPl7Lmj8L7E8yJA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=Snw9oAxwcW-qlb-bUIeASQ#Snw9oAxwcW-qlb-bUIeASQ\n\nQuesadilla, $6.95 + Peppers, $2\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=Lualv9KuNGft6MChnGZwpg#Lualv9KuNGft6MChnGZwpg\n\n1L Water, $3\n\nThe Nachos were pretty good, but messy.  I had to eat 1/2 of the dish with a fork because the bottom half was soaked in Queso Cheese.  I don't recommend ordering this to take on a plane....it's not plane friendly as you will get messy.\n\nThe Quesadilla was very interesting.  I ordered it with the Peppers, which was an additional $2....it actually came with Peppers & Onions.  It tasted like an Italian Pepper & Onions Sandwich.....which was good, but unexpected.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was pretty good for airport food.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%","Took 15 minutes to get a chicken burrito, and there was no line. There were more people behind the counter than waiting for food. Seriously, this is way too slow for airport food. Food is only so-so - Chipotle is better (and way faster).","It's not the worst option for fast food style airport food. They have veggie tacos that provide reasonable portions and nice scoops of guacamole. The rice is awful and the salsa is more like pizza sauce. Although it's affordable and quick.","I ordered the breakfast bowl with Applewood bacon and queso. I asked for no salsa, which they accommodated me on that. However, their chilaquilas (an ingredient in my bowl) is really enchilada sauce. In what world are those two the same thing? Chilaquilas is eggs, nacho chip strips, ranchero sauce and cheese. Since they soaked all of the chips in this enchilada sauce, the whole thin tasted horrible. The bacon was in whole slices rather than broken up - doesn't make sense for eating a bowl. They used green olives which I've NEVER had on Mexican food. I hate green olives and would have asked which kind they were had I thought they might something other than the traditional black olives. My husband did not like his breakfast tacos either. The only reason they are getting two stars is we've had good quesadillas here before.","I had about an hour to spare between early morning flights at Skyharbor and so decided to try out a new place.\n\nI ordered the turkey sausage sliders as I hadn't seen those on a menu before.\n\nI think everything is cooked fresh and so it took a few minutes to prepare (which was fine for me, but if you have to catch a flight that might not be great).\n\nThe bread buns were nice a light/fluffy - perhaps like brioche - the turkey sausage was kind of flavourless, the egg \"pancake\" was terrible, like microwaved frozen eggs terrible I honestly thought it was a pancake at first until I looked at the menu again.  There was some cheese present, but it had no taste.\n\nI added both the salsa they give you and some sriracha I asked for, but nothing could save the sliders.\n\nThere was a side of fried potatoes/papas but they were very small pieces and had been overcooked.\n\nBased on this meal I would not eat here again.","It's hard to fail at nachos, and I had the blandest nachos I've ever had, despite the beans, cheese, jalapeños, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo piled on top. I'm not even sure which topping it was that tasted like cardboard because it ALL kinda tasted like variations of paper. \n\nThe space is small, and you order and then stand around blocking everybody else while you wait for your number to be called so then you can nudge your way back to the front. \n\nI'm only adding a star because they seemed to have a decent beer variety on tap, although I didn't get any because there was no place to eat inside the premises.","I actually think the food is four stars based on the airport scale of jeebusi'vebeenpoisonedtellmyfamilyilovethem to prettygoodactuallyididntjustgoovermycaloriesfortheweekinoneday.   Just clean your tables and give us more seats. It's crowded like a frat party on a Friday night. Forfuxsake.","Got the bacon breakfast taco on a layover. Pretty odd and greasy-the tortilla was fried on the griddle, I believe. Definitely not a traditional breakfast taco, the salsa was closer to ketchup.

{"reviews":["The offerings are authentic, tasty and shall return soon! Satisfied with the service and atmosphere was inviting, clean and pleasing. Thanks!","I had a fabulous time at Jalisco Cantina and was very impressed. It is conveniently located right off the 215 at Sunset, and there was ample close parking. The atmosphere is pleasant and homey. The video poker bar is completely separate from the restaurant area, and the décor is very tasteful. The service staff is absolutely great. Everybody was extremely friendly and accommodating, not to mention super fast. And the food was fabulous. As authentic as I have found in Las Vegas. I have lived in Las Vegas for 21 years and try as many of the Mexican restaurants in town as I can. They make their guacamole in 3 styles from fresh, whole avocados. I sampled the clasico and the camaron tropical with shrimp and mango. Both were excellent! They also make all of their tortillas fresh in-house, as well as their chips -  which were as good as they get. They have over 90 items on the menu, so selection isn't a problem! I also had 2 different margaritas, the top shelf and the spicy. Both were excellent! I tackled their \"muy caliente\" salsa and about caught on fire! And I can usually handle hot! Not for the faint LOL - won't be doing that again! The mild was excellent, had ample spice and flavor, and was more my speed I guess! I will be back!","Was in the mood for some good Mexican Food, and thought SuperMex would fit the script. Arrived to learn that it is now Jalisco Cantina. Menu seemed similar, so I thought what's the harm? I noticed many spots on the wall needed a paint touch up, but the new art being displayed was nice. Was promptly served tortilla chips with beans and salsa. The salsa had a good kick, but the beans were pretty bland. Ordered the chile rellano, and chicken enchiladas with rice. Our waiter gave us a plate with shredded beef enchiladas instead. Initially we were not too thrilled, but thankfully it was tasty. The rice, however, was lacking big time. The chile rellano was eh, and we never got any more chips. Makes me sad.","Stopped by for dinner and pleased. The chips and salsa and bean dip were great. I mentioned to our server that I like spicy stuff she went to the kitchen and came back out with some of their spicy salsa. It was very spicy and fresh. It was cool of her to do that and said it can be requested on future visits. \n\nI ordered the carne asada casero burrito but asked them to leave off the bbq sauce and add tomatillo instead. I also asked to have just meat, cheese and sour cream inside my burrito and no rice on my plate. When my burrito came it looked so good but when I cut it open there was rice and beans along with the meat, cheese and sour cream. I was disappointed because I said that I did not want any rice and was specific about what I wanted in my burrito. I could have said something but didn't want to wait for it to be remade and just ate around the rice. The tomatillo sauce was very good and so was the burrito aside from the goof. When our server came to check on us she noticed the pile of rice on my plate and was upset my burrito did not come out right. She offered twice to have it remade but I explained that it was fine, and that she even noticed meant something. My wife loved her meal and had no complaints. Service was great and we were checked on often. This is a legit place to eat and I will back.","No complaints but no accolades.  Their food is just OK.  The beans are bland but they give them to you complimentary.  The spicier salsa was ok.  We had the chicken bowl, salad and a beef enchilada.  Nothing spectacular.  Good deal if you buy the Groupon.  Otherwise, stick to the lunch specials.  Not terribly authentic.","The grilled shrimp tacos were very good....guacamole was fresh and the portion was huge...my husband loved the carne asada tacos.  All in all, a great value for the price. We will be back...","There is no more Chicken Taco Salad lunch special.  I used to order that 2-3 times per week. I'm upset that my favorite lunch restaurant has changed :(.  I was informed it was the same owners but the food and service are not where near as good as they used to be.","Okay for a quick meal, had the same server twice and both times we were disappointed.  Margaritas are good.","My new favorite place for Mexican food! When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good. \n\nI ordered \"Tacos Del Campo\" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the \"Casero Burrito\" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly. \n\nJalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.\n\nCurrently they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.","We were trying to go somewhere quite close to home. Honestly can't get closer than this. We were greeted right away by our server Martin. My husband had many questions about the special. It was shrimp tacos with jicama slaw. He did not know what jicama was. Martin took his time in explaining what it is. \nWe started with the chips, salsa and beans. Very good way to begin. We ordered the fresh guacamole. Also quite delicious. My DH had the special, I went for the albondigas soup and a salad. The soup came in a huge bowl. Honestly enough for two people. The flavor was subtle and perfect. The meatballs plenty  and delicious. The salad was fresh with cucumbers ,romaine, tomatoes and queso fresco cheese. I took half of both home. \nMy DH ate every bit of the special. Loved the jicama slaw. \nThe portions are generous, the service outstanding. Priced right for the amount of food. We will be returning.","Wasent sure what I was getting into trying this new place but I must say I'm glad I stopped by and tried the taste of greatness there good was great and the horchata delicious and my carne asada burrito I had was just what my hunger was looking for I recommend stopping by! Tip try the horchata  and carne asada your won't be disappointed.","Went once. Margarita was terrible. Green chile pork was better than I thought it would be.","Phenomenal! I'm a picky foodie so when I say something is good it's great! The steak fajitas, ceviche and top shelf margaritas (only $8 and they're huge) are excellent quality! Free Blues Band LIVE on Tuesday and Saturday.","Food does not have any flavors.... The guacamole needs some spices and more avocado.\nI would not recommend this place, unless you are really hungry and don't really care","Brutal service!!!  The ladies here do not want to be here.  Food was decent.  The only positive was a huge cold beer that they brought to the table.  This experience is not worthy of a review.","I was craving some good late night Mexican food with my fellow Yelpers and we decided to check out one of the best happy hours at Supermex. To our surprise, Supermex was re-branded into Jalisco Cantina. Undeterred, we came in to familiar surroundings and sat down near the bar.\n\nThough the restaurant looks the same as before, the menu has undergone some changes and unfortunately not all are for the better. There was no happy hour menu available and after finally getting the attention of our server/bartender, he quickly mouthed off a couple dishes on HH and left us. Unlike before, only select appetizers were half off and the portions/recipes have definitely changed. I wanted to order the chicken street tacos but our server quickly corrected us that they are now called the Tacos Tijuana and for whatever reason only the carne asada ones were covered under HH, no chicken. We also ordered guacamole as an appetizer and Mexican Pizza (new item!). Note: chips and salsa were included as well!\n\nWhen we got the guacamole I was left wondering if the cook forgot to mash up the avocado. Now I don't mind big chucks, but this guacamole was really just diced avocados in pico de gallo. \n\nUnfortunately, the new Tacos Tijuana are nothing like what they used to be. Instead of the three generous street tacos before, I got two reduced size carne asada tacos with some rice and beans. The tacos fell victim to 'soggy tortilla syndrome' where the contents escaped to all over my plate. I really wish they didn't change it up as the street tacos were delicious and a great meal in themselves.\n\nNow the Mexican Pizza was a pleasant surprise. Like the tacos, for whatever reason the happy hour special only covered the chicken toppings. The pizza was a good portion, with plenty of chicken, mushrooms, and cheese on a thin but crispy toastada like base. Definitely a great new edition to the menu.\n\nOur server was terrible to put it nicely. He took about ten minutes to come up to us, and seemed annoyed when we asked him to repeat the list of ~8 happy hour options (they really should just print out a list). He never brought us out our utensils and we had to flag him down over and over for refills. Maybe he was just having a bad day but he just seemed hurried and uninterested, and there weren't even that many people in the bar area. \n\nI give kudos to the management for changing up the menu and trying new things but I really wish they didn't downsize some of their better dishes. I used to come here twice a month when it was Supermex but now I'm wondering if I'll ever be back.","Since they changed the name (formerly Super Mex), things have gotten better at this location. I'm a big fan of their nachos. Before the remodel, they were good. Now...they're pretty awesome! The grilled chicken nachos are my favorite, but they also have steak, shrimp and a few other options. The servers are friendly and usually pretty good about refills on drinks and chips and salsa. The Ceviche I'd a great way to start your meal. It's big enough for 2 or 3 people to share. Prices are a little more than before but still reasonable. I definitely like the new spin on the place.","I think this place is pretty awesome.  I first came here along with coworkers because it was close to our work location.  Seems to be the go to for when the office is craving Mexican.  This place is clean and actually is pretty busy during lunch time.  \n\nThey first serve you with their chips, salsa, and bean dip...all very simply, amazing!  I think I get carried away with it when I go there because I get full before my meal even arrives.  \n\nI usually like to order any of their burritos.  Its massive.  I first ordered the shrimp burrito because I thought it would be skimpy, boy was I wrong.  Shrimp in every single bite.  I was waay full by the time I got halfway. \n\nYou can sometimes find Groupon deals for this place, so shop smart so you can save yourself some money to attempt to try the whole menu :)","Once again groupon helped out in trying a new spot. The bar and restaurant area are very cool. You can tell they really tried to get that authentic look. The drink prices are pretty steep. Especially for the margarita which consisted of sour and tequila with some line juice squeezed in. The bartender Imelda was very nice. Now the reason for the four stars was the food. I am kicking myself in the butt for not ordering the street tacos which I believe is what they are known for. I opted for the Jalisco carnitas plate which wasn't so good. I was hungry so I took it down. I'll try it again soon and get the street tacos next time.","Ok because I had a groupon. Otherwise the chips were stale and the food just wasn't that good. My food and my husbands were both wrong when they came out.","Came here for a quick cheap lunch with el novio. Purchased the Groupon and in we went. There was no one to greet us and there was no one in the dining room so we went into the bar and were told by the bartenders to sit wherever we wanted.. Decided on a comfy booth in the bar area and then shortly after a server brought over some menus. \n\nAfter ordering our food we decided on some happy hour dranks. The server told us the Groupon can not be used on Happy Hour.. which is the same as everywhere else but most places will just open a separate check for you.. Not here. That was fine though because I just made by man go to the bar and get our drinks there LOL How can you pass up $1 bud light and $2 margaritas?!!? \n-I got the shredded Baracoa salad which comes in a taco shell and is really delicious! Lots of fresh avocado and they don't use cheap lettuce.\n-boyfriend got the 3 plate combo with carne asada tacos, beef taquitos, chicken enchilada, rice & beans.. This was just OK. \n-chips, salsa & bean dip were good. We were not offered a refill~ \n\nThe service from the server was alright. She did her job and nothing more. Although to make her life easier they should probably assign 1 room for seating so that she doesn't have to run through 3 separate dining areas. The female bartender was nice though ;]]]","Decent food but chicken has no flavor! Drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game!","Didnt know that there's a great Mexican place just a few blocks away from our house. Found a groupon and checked reviews on yelp. Decided to check this place out. We ordered the guacamole - not the usual but in chunks. It was good. we got the green chili rellenos and carne asada burrito. Servings r huge! Will go back again","The atmosphere is okay...good music although it was dead inside. The staff was friendly although did not offer any personality and it appeared that she unhappy being there. The food was good for the prices and the margarita was decent as well. Again the overall experience could be summed up as okay.","Non pretentious Mexican restaurant. Great food for the price. Came here when it was Super Mex and I will continue to dine here. Service is great and very nice.","Mini Chimichanga  is very filling. Fresh taco was very good as well. They make good pico, salad and chip.","No comparison to Roberto's please this is a nice place and staff is very friendly I think even more now with the name change.  If you want food at any time of the day or night this is the place for you.  Excellent prompt service I have been here several times and   haven't been dissapointed yet.","Two stars because food was decent. Carne asada was really tender. One additional star because the bartender immediately greeted us and was nice. \n\nHowever.... The seats within the bar are really uncomfortable. We sat at a little table and I could not get comfy. Maybe I'm weird, but I didn't like it. Next, I went to the ladies room and the entire door was missing to the entrance. Why?! What happened? I stood their confused. Men's room had a bathroom door, why couldn't the ladies? \n\nI would eat here again. Oh! It also was weird that the bartender was walking around smoking a cigarette. I didn't care about that really, just didn't seem professional. \n\nFood is good though! Seriously, eat here.","We come here regularly not for the great service but for the reasonably priced food. I have gotten a few different things here. I've gotten chicken taquitos that were good. I also got the lettuce wraps one time but the shredded chicken was too greasy. My favorite is their carne asada burrito. They put an adobe sauce over it that I always say no to. I usually get a side of tomatillo sauce to put on top but be prepared it has a kick. The free chips and beans are always a nice way to start our meal as well.","I really liked this place which was very surprising to me. I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant here that I am crazy about but I really liked the food! Went for breakfast and had the barbacoa plate. The meat had not fat at all and was not greasy and fat like that kind of meat normally is! It came with eggs, potatoes, and tortillas. The portion was great and so was the price. They have a good selection for breakfast lunch and dinner. They have a full bar and happy hour specials.","Bad food, horrible service, and a TERRIBLE manager!\n\nNickle and dime you to death...used to LOVE coming here, but never again. And when we tried to speak with the Manager about it he laughed and walked away...\n\nStay Classy Jalisco.  Stay Classy.","I ordered the mixed street tacos and got one fish and one vegetarian. The vegetarian one had beer battered avocados with fresh mango salsa. They were both so good it made me feel like I was eating tacos on the beach in Mexico! Very fresh and yummy tasting!","I love this place.  Food portions are huge. Great prices. Great service. I like the karaoke nights & live bands performing. They always have deals with Groupon &  yelp. Must try Mexican restaurant. I get the carne asada street tacos almost every time with side of bean and rice. Taste delicious.","Worst service ever. Given wrong menu when we walked in. Then waited 30 minutes before someone finally came over they told us we had the wrong menus, replaced then, and then never came back. Waited another 20 minutes before having to flag a waiter down to get the check. He shrugged us off and never came back with it. Finally had to go to the bar to pay for the single round of drinks we had and leave. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. With service like that I see an available restaurant space in the near future.","My all time fave Mexican restaurant!!","Just had a happy hour snack at Jaliscos. Great chips and salsa.  Excellent bacon wrapped shrimp and pacifico on tap!!!\n\nHighly recommend it!  BTW, ask for Edson...nice guy and good server!","So not impressed. I think they gave us salad dressing instead of salsa. Everything was very bland (including the hot sauce). Service ok (glasses sat empty for a while).","This place is just okay. 3 to 3 1/2 stars describes this place well. I got the specialty tacos which were ok, the chips and salsa lacked being hot and had no salt.","This is the former Super Mex, just rebranded.\n\nThe menu is pretty much the same. If there are differences, they are slight and I didn't notice. Same goes for the prices. There is a current Groupon running, which is $11 for $20 worth of food. That makes this place a viable lunch option if I want Mexican food at a decent value other than Roberto's."],"business_id":"aWzzk2rkruGryk-1-s3DHA","name":"Jalisco Cantina","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go!\n\nEl Charro has been at this location for many years. My husband used to go there as kid and he's in his 30s. I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food but I do get a craving once in a while and El Charro is one of two places I like to go.\n\nThe price is right and food is even better. Everything I've had is delicious and their guacamole is one of the best. Lots of flavor and generous portions too. Their tamales is definitely one of the best ones.\n\nThe service can be really crappy. Their dining room and bar is completely separated by a door. The regular waitress in the bar is fantastic and never had a problem with her. The dining room however has been a disappointment many times. They're slow and don't like to come by very often. Last time we were there, we waited 20 minutes for a refill and container but never got them. We had to go ask someone for a container and just left. But it seems pretty consistent that we end up waiting a long time for any service once food is out.\n\nThey do close every summer for couple of months so be sure they're open if you go July-September.","Hands down best place ever! I've been going here for 24 years and I love it!","My favorite place for Mexican food. This place has been a family favorite for a very long time.","I've been going here since I was 5 years old and have yet to find a better Mexican food place!","I live not too far from here so we stopped in since we always see it's crowded and assumed it must be good.  Not!  I'm hispanic and this is the worst mexican food I've ever had in my entire life.  Totally revolting.  We were amazed at first how quickly the food came out.  When we got our order, we understood why. Everything is microwaved.  The rice had dried out pieces from the microwave.  My taco was most likely prepared in advance and reheated since all the meat in it was dried out.  \n\nAlso, on the decor, they have the hostess station and cashier literally right at the front door.  So, if you're coming in, you are blocking the way of those trying to leave.  The restaurant is very dark, probably in an attempt to hide the filthy mouldering carpet, dilapidated torn seats and greasy walls.  It sure looks like they've never bothered to remodel once in the entire time they've been open.  Which is fine as long as you also clean and take care of damaged items; which unfortunately is not the case here.  \n\nWe left hungry and went to Alibertos down the street which, while not the best, is cheaper and fresher.  I was so mad that I paid for horrendous food.  I will not be going there ever again.","i've been going here since i was a kid! chips and salsa are so good! i am not sure if the food is super awesome, it may be a nostalgic thing, but can't help but love it!","Not again ! I think next time I go to Mesa AZ I will check for non authentic names. I got cheated!","Just a little tip I had forgotten to mention: El Charro closes for several months during the summer. So if you are planning on going during the summer months, you might want to call and make sure they are open....","My absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant on the planet. I live in Mexico for two years and craves El Charro even after eating authentic Mexican food. Their hot sauce is seriously the best I've ever had and my favorite things are just the classic bean burrito or cheese crisp. \nDefinitely a must go and you've got to have the hot sauce. I crave it all the time. \nI don't know how this place doesn't have 5 stars.","El Charro seriously lacks in the ambiance and decor department.  Its is pretty shabby looking...inside and out.  Its the kind of place that I would drive by and say...why would anyone stop there to eat?  But one night my coworkers wanted to check it and I was stuck because they were my ride.  I admit I was pretty skeptical and and actually a little pouty about their dining choice.  I kicked up the attitude even more when we were seated at a sticky table that wobbled.  I contemplated not ordering anything, but my growling stomach was telling me to shut up and order some damn tacos already!  So I ordered the shredded beef taco combo and looked on the bright side; if I get food poisoning at least I get the day off of work!  But let me just say, El Charro is a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover.  The food was very, very good.  Seriously the best hard shell taco I have ever had!  The shells are made to order so they have that fresh from the fryer awesomeness to them.  The beef was seasoned very well and a dollop of sour cream cooled down the tasty fire their red hot sauce brings to the dish.  I can't say much about the rice and beans because I didn't eat more than a bite...the 2 tacos were huge and more than enough to fill me up.  Seriously a 4 star meal...but I just can't bring myself to give El Charro a better rating.  They seem to do some pretty good business so my advice to them would be to sink some money into this joint and update it a little.","This is Old School Mexican and just about as good as it gets. Inside, it looks dark and dingy. The furniture looks as if it were bought in 1963. The dining room/bar is well-worn and comfortable. \n\nUpon sitting, drink orders were taken and homemade salsa and chips were brought and refilled without our asking. The food arrived quickly after ordering and it was HOT (temperature and spice). \n\nThe food is great and there's plenty of it. The three of us enjoyed green chile rellenos, enchildas and burritos. Each entree came with refried beans, spanish rice and cole slaw. They have a full-service bar, but we've only been there for lunch. Soda on the gun are RC products. The iced tea is brewed (kudos!!). Service was well above average. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Our glasses were never empty for long. \n\nThe food is excellent. The waitstaff is attentive. The prices are reasonable. Three men had lunch (with a tip) for under $40. What more can one ask?","Where do I start? With this being one of the oldest Mexican restaurants around the area I thought they would have mastered what they served! Im a fairly adventuras eater so I deceided to try the tongue. I didnt know that you could keep tongue for the 80 years or so that the restaurant has been there but I guess they did! It was soo pungent and gamey I could only eat a few bites and that flavor and aroma stayed with me for many hours with every acidic and bloated belch!The good thing about the place is that it has survived this long and is a good place to hang out and drink if you dont want to have to do it with a bunch of roudy kids.","It is the typical old school sonoran mexican joint. Nothing wowed me. Tamale was close to hormel from a can. Taco was good.","Been eating here all my life! The letter D crisp and green chili burrito are my top choices!","This was our first time to this place and it was great!!!   We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday evening and the place was packed.  We were seated right away and the waitress was there within in a couple of minutes for our drink order.  She was back within a few minutes with our drinks and we ordered.  She was back again within a few minutes with our food.  I couldn't believe how fast the food came out of that kitchen and piping hot.\n\nIf you are looking for a good Mexican meal, with good service then this is the place for you.  Don't expect fancy, as this is a very casual restaurant with good food and fast service!","The place is probably not the best looking restaurant you can find in Mesa. The building is a bit dated and the decor is as well. However, the staff is very friendly, efficient, and helpful. When you order your food and the restaurant and bar are both packed, you can still expect to get your entire order in less that 5 minutes. The food is awesome and about as authentic as you can get.","I know people are going to disagree with me, and that's fine. The food isn't great, the service is iffy, the decor is awful, the place reeks of smoke from the lounge even though indoor smoking was banned years ago, but I really love me some El Charro. So much so that I drive from the far west side to Mesa for the experience. \n\nTheir hot sauce alone is worth the drive. The food is gringo-Sonoran, and is as good as any gringo-Sonoran out there. Tacos, enchiladas, tamales, chimichangas, you know the drill. There are also dishes that aren't found everywhere, like the Spanish Tongue Platter. This is something special. \n\nIf you like Sonoran-style food and 50s-style dives, El Charro is the place for you.","Atmosphere inside is dark and has an old school feel. I had the guacamole tosada and it was ok.  I'll probably get something different if we go back though.  My boyfriend and my dad got the chimichanga and they loved them.  The service could have been better.  I didn't ever get a refill on my drink and I don't know about you, but when I pay $2 for a soda, I'd like to get a refill.","Grew up w/El Charro, USE to be great, now it's just 'go there if someother place is closed'! Dark and family orientated but I want good food, and you don't get it here.","Dingy, dark, dirty, sticky -- that's your table. Greasy, unappealing, low quality -- that's your food. Someone obviously put a lot of time, money and love to build this business (from the decor I'm guessing it was once an interesting, somewhat upscale place). Today, it's a dump.\n\nI ordered the chile relenos. The beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless. There was more egg than chile, though it was hard to tell because of all the cheese congealing over the plate. I'll never go here again.","A fitting embodiment of It Is What It Is.\n\nI've been twice, in 1991 and again in 2005. From what I can remember, it hadn't changed at all between then. Smoky in the bar area, though another review tells me that's old news now. I wasn't 21 for either of those visits, but I can imagine sitting at the bar for a couple of hours around lunch would give me the full experience were I to do it now.\n\nFood-wise, nothing spectacular with the enchiladas I ordered the last time. But the beauty of El Charro is that it doesn't advertise itself as the best of the best, just a fixture at that location and a reputable spot to grab a drink or some acceptable Mexican food if you're in the area. I'm sure if I find myself near that part of town again some afternoon I'll stop in again.","El Charro has been in Mesa  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. The other reviewer was correct in that it used to be super smoky, but not anymore. Since the place is small, every table was a smoking table. My chain-smoking parents loved that back in the day...ha. \n\nThe food is wonderful. The inside is dark, old school, and it's like stepping back in time with the sticky vinyl booths and 70's table tops. They did paint it a dark green on the inside many years back, which was a nice change from the dark red it used to be. It used to be like stepping into a horror flick. \n\nMy parents have been going here since the 1970's. We practically ate there every week when I was a child. I missed it dearly when I moved out of state. Don't know if El Charro is necessarily authentic but that doesn't matter to me. \n\nThe soft tacos are my personal favorite. The chips are usually always hot. They have two salsas, a hotter one in a squeeze bottle and a milder one in a bowl, both very good. The prices are reasonable, the staff is nice, and your food comes out very quickly. :)","Good, standard Mexican food.  Mexican food to me is mostly all the same.  A good Mexican place tastes basically the same as the next good Mexican place, so don't expect anything mind blowing here.  Expect good food and good service for a good price.  They do serve RC Cola which I love... much better than Coke or Pepsi.\n\nDon't come here for \"healthy eating\", pretty much everything is made with lard....and as expected, tastes good.\n\nThey have a full bar and there are always a decent amount of people eating, but not too packed.  This place is family owned/run and has been here for over 22 years.","I was totally creeped out by El Charro when I first went in there.  Super dark (like, you seriously cant see in there for about 5 minutes when you first walk in and are literally blinded by the AZ sun when you come back out), cold, and at the time SERIOUSLY smoky (but not anymore).  Its very small and cave-like, but dont let the weird ambiance deter you from trying this mexican joint.\n\nI always have the cheese tea, which is just a cheese quesadilla so I dont know why they have this odd name...  They also have the mexican cheese tea which is filled with cheese and beef.  Its lathered in butter so be prepared to hit the gym afterwards, but its worth it.  The burritos are good too, and surprisingly I hear they make an exceptional cheeseburger. \n\nBe forewarned, El Charro closes for three months in the summer, so call for open hours.","I have been going to El Charro since a young child and it is fantastic. We eat there at least once a week. These are my top favorites:\n\nBean Tostada\nMexican Cheese Tortilla\nBean and Cheese Burrito\nGreen Mix Burro\n\nIf you sit in the bar they serve a bean dip at night that is fabulous, get there early though as they only make one pot for the night, once its gone, its gone. \n\nStop in and give them a try, you wont be disappointed!","OK folks, here we go.  When we walked in I thought to myself \" damn this food must be amazing because it looks like a dive bar in here\"  I was wrong.  The service was great and as a server myself, I tend to notice these things.  I should have realized how the food was going to be when I noticed every person there was Caucasian. Its a bad sign when eating Mexican food. By the way, we are both white. We ordered a chicken burro and expressed that we could not have dairy as my girlfriend is allergic.  We asked for guac, pico, rice and lettuce to be added.  I ordered the tongue plate.  When our food arrived it looked OK at best.  My girlfriend checked her burro and realized it only had chicken. Its an $8 burro.  I asked the server if we could get the things I asked for and was told \"sorry, we are old school.  the cooks wont do it\"  We decided to push on.  My girlfriend took one bite and said it tasted like microwave, unseasoned chicken.  She made it 3 bites in before we paid and left.\n\nIf you want mediocre \"Mexican food\" in a dark dingy incredibly outdated restaurant, this is the place for you! Good luck.","Highly recommended to us and always packed, but it was just ok. The salsa and chips were good and if you wanted more, you get charged for it. Yeah, the normal chips and salsa that comes out to every mexican restaurant. It was slop on a plate and the seasoning was off to me. I had tacos and the flavoring was salty and my girlfriend had beef enchiladas and they were cheese with beef put on top. So now we go across the street to the blue adobe I think it is called. Across the street to the right.","This place does not deserve not even one star.  As we open the door you are slapped with an odor of mugginess, mold, mildew, grease, humidity and stinky dirty carpet.  I understand this restaurant has lots of memories to mesa residents and has been around but the ceilings have watermarks, the walls and artwork look greasy and dusty.  Chairs are filthy and dirty.  Hostess/cashier needs to be more welcoming and attentive. Our waitress was not courteous at all. Not once did she come by after our meal was served to see if we needed something.  Either people don't know what real Mexican flavor is all about or El charros clients have some serious taste buds issues that need immediate attention.    HOW in the world is this place in business!! I am sorry if I am offending anyone BUT the food is disgusting.  I ordered a Chile relleno it should be renamed omelet with a green Chile inside it.  Rice was overcooked and mushy,  Beans were so so. One of the people in my party ordered the 2 tacos and tamale.  OMG!!! Tamale with tomato sauce something out of a can???? Tacos, don't get me even started there, how could they serve this????The meat was too dry, too dark, and shredded to the point where it looked like ground up road kill from 3 days ago.  The only decent thing on our plates were the chicken taco that was edible.   I consider myself very adventurous and trying new restaurants and cuisines and I have a very adaptable palate but this is not good homemade/american/mexican food.   IF they are going to close only for the summer use that time wisely upgrading or doing some cosmetic changes to the restaurant but most of all get new cooks and training your current staff. A smile goes a long way.....\nI hope that this restaurant is only in business due to their established and loyal clientele because if you are a new customer I wouldn't even spend a penny.  I left feeling hungry but most of all pissed because I actually paid for bad food.  Next time I am taking my client to any hole in the wall restaurant or street vendor where I am sure I will find some flavor in my food.  I am so disappointed with this place and can't believe they said this was a good restaurant.","El Charro is just the best Mexican food I've ever had, hands down and I looooooves me my Mexican food. Unfortunately I live in California now where they believe Mexican food has to be pretty above all else. Mexican food is NOT about pretty! Mexican food is about greasy cheesy spicy goodness wrapped in deliciousness and fried in real lard! I've been going here for decades and every time I'm back in Arizona I make it a point to go at least twice. \n\nPeople who are hung up on 'host services' or other BS should just order the green chili burro and shut up. This place is about speed, cheap, and wanting to gorge yourself on everything on the menu until they have to cart you out in a wheelbarrow with smile on your face so wide they can count your fillings.\n\nOK, since I should be 'unbiased' and 'fair' and all that stuff, here: \n1. Cashier/host staff aren't exactly plucked from the Rainbow Room. They can be in a hurry or just lazy. The wait staff are good though.\n2. As unhealthy as it gets if you're insane enough to care when food is this good.\n3. The music - recently they started piping in some 'authentic' Mexican music to add some sort of ambiance. They need to go back to how it used to be, it does get annoying.\n4. I'm reaching for a con here but If you are into taking a long time savoring your appetizer before the mains come, you'll be disappointed. The waiter goes to the kitchen, the door swings open and the door swings back as your waiter emerges with your food. Some days I was sure they were psychic because I couldn't believe it was that fast.\n5. Hands down the MOST ANNOYING thing about El Charro is that it closes for an agonizing 2-3 months in the summer time. Yes, no one wants to be in Mesa in the summer time, but COME ON the people need their fix!\n\nBut let's be honest, those cons are NOTHING compared to the pros of this place. Go here, go here often and take your friends/families.","We were handed the menu and told to take the last booth. We sat down. Looked at the menu for a sec. Were bothered by it and walked out. Terrible host","I have been going to El Charro since I was in the womb!  This place is without a doubt a tradition.  The food is good, but not spectacular, the place is small and a bit dingy but like I said it's tradition.  Avoid the margaritas they are never good no matter how many times we try them.  \n\nI'm not sure I would take people here from out of town or to show them the great food of Phoenix by any means but my son will grow up with it just like I did, it's just yummy, inexpensive and tradition!","Let me first say that IF I was able to give ZERO stars I would for this restaurant.  Apparently, they do not read their reviews, as if they did maybe things would change...MAYBE!\n\nMy husband and I decided to try El Charro out for the first time on Saturday, we were very much looking forward to trying this so called \"Mesa Gem\" since it is very close to our home.  Upon entering the building we were greeted by the hostess, she told us it would be about a 10 minute wait, and if we wanted, we could go in the lounge for drinks & they would come get us when our table was ready.  We proceeded to the lounge and after a couple minutes the bartender came and took our order.  She asked us if we would like chips & salsa while we waited and we told her that would be great, well she NEVER BROUGHT THEM.  Several minutes later she finally came back to check on us, and I asked her if the hostess would come and get us back here and she assured us they would, she then let us know that we could just eat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait on a table, we decided that would be great since we were very hungry, and she said \"I will get you some menus\"...since it was taking forever for her to grab a couple menus I decided to go to the front and see how long it was until we got our table since we had already been waiting over 20 minutes.  When I asked, they said \"we called you at 6:51 and you didn't answer\"...I politely told them that we were in the lounge and were assured that someone would come get us when our table was ready, the hostess apologized and said she will work on getting us a table right away.  I went back to the lounge and sat back down, three other patrons came in, were seated, given chips and salsa right away, and drinks were being poured all the while we sat with NO SERVICE!  The bartender finally came back after 10 minutes of ignoring us and asked \"so, do you want to eat in here?\", we said \"we told you 10 minutes ago that we wanted to eat in here and you went to get menus and never came back, so no, we have decided to leave since we are getting terrible service\", she looked at us, gave a nasty dirty look and walked off.\nNeedless to say, we will NEVER return to this place.  How it has been in business for over 34 years is beyond me.  Never in my life have I ever been treated so poorly at a restaurant.\nI truly hope that this review helps others in their decision, don't be like us and give them the benefit of the doubt despite quite a few bad reviews.","I have been a die hard fan of this place but over the past couple of years something has happened to the quality of the food, it's gone down. My advice? catch it when they open up from being closed all summer, maybe the staff will have a renewed excitement about making the food. Anyway that's my plan and I will let you know .","ARE THEY OPEN AGAIN YET?\n\nI swear it's been forever since I've seen they closed for the summer. Anyways, hope they are so we can resume going. My husband's family has been going to this place for his entire 30 years of existence so it would be blasphemous to give this place less than 5 stars for the sense of tradition it holds in their family. \n\nThere's not anything I could quite say about their food or decor to set it apart from other Mexican restaurants...but it's just El Charro! You either love it with all your heart or...you're indifferent to the place! lol \n\nOne thing's for sure, you always get your food FAST. They have their system down pat in the back, and I've seen the same servers there for the three years I've been coming to this place. Ryan's seen the same servers since he was a little kid! So they must treat their servers well.\n\nEl Charro's will always be a family favorite. It's an oldie but a goodie!","This place is an \"old school\" Mesa staple that is always packed... with white people, go figure. That should've been the first red flag to walk out. However after years of avoiding this place I was caught in moment of weakness and proximity. Bad decision. Disgusting!  \n\nSent back two plates. One was cold and the other was a disaster, like someone threw up on my plate. I just walked out. El Charro needs to change its name to El Chafa or El Chorros.","I've been here twice now. Last time I got 3 hard tacos and this time I got 3 soft tacos. Both were great! Very filling and delicious.  My wife orders the cheese enchiladas and those are very good as well. Highly recommended!","Tacos and margaritaswere iffy, the rest of the dinner was good and our server was pleasant.","Let's address those who give this place a few stars and say it is dark and gloomy. These persons were obviously expecting something else. I happen to appreciate that somethings do not change. The Florentino Room is a dank and dark bar lined with Ezra Brooks decanthers worth more than your lunch. The food, good. You go here because this is El Charro, a tradition with good and long time Arizona families. If you and yours are from                , well, we can't help it can we?","Fresh chips and salsa and fabulous green chile.  The negative is that they close for a good portion of the summer.","Can you say awesome beans and rice, wonderful hot sauce, and lots of mormons?!? \nNormally, I would never eat at a place that looks the way El Charro does on the outside and on the inside. But ever since trying to impress an ex boyfriends parents by eating there with them, I have been a fan and can now zone out the atmosphere. \nThey have really good bean burrito's and tacos, but what I really go there for is the rice and beans which are usually mediocre and are simply there in case you need a little somethin more at other restaurants. I can't describe what makes them so great at El Charro but they just are! The beans are the perfect consistency (not too runny, not too thick) and the rice has great flavor and big chunks of tomato and onion. \nAlso worth of a shoutout are the salsa (chunky with really good flavor) and the macaroni salad that you can get with certain meals (its home made I believe). \nDownsides are that they charge you for more than one bowl of chips and salsa sometimes (I think if you are on their good side, they will not charge you), and their chili rellenos suck!!! Whatever you do, don't order them. I guess the inside and outside of the building could use some spucing up as well. \nThis place is an institution in AZ and in our family.","This place is practically an institution in Mesa. It's been here for several decades... and it shows. The booth cushions are toast, the lighting is shabby and bare, it needs new un-green paint. However, this is fantastic Mexican food at a very reasonable price. Perfect for lunch or a casual dinner.\n\nDon't let the neighborhood scare you off... it's perfectly safe.","Last time I went here I got food poisoned, so tread carefully.","Girlfriend wanted Mexican food and not just a regular run to Taco Bell. She mentioned El Charro since she grew up in Mesa. I have to say I was not impressed. I'm not very demanding either but I'll take the \"gringo\" Mexican food served at Tee Pee's any day over the food I was served here. Service was fine but the decor seems or rather is very outdated. Dark and green. We ate at the bar area and the best part of the meal was the chips and salsa I can say that. Ordered a sour cream enchilada off the menu and it was just so so to be honest. I'd eat there if someone wanted to but I won't be making the trip voluntarily. I can however see how for some it's a family tradition,etc. Just won't be mine.","My sister suggested El Charro last night for dinner. I had never been and after looking at some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the interior is a little dark and dated, but I found it somewhat charming as I don't like cookie cutter restaurants. Our service was great. Our server was very sweet and attentive. Never had to wait for drink or chip refills. During our meal 2 other employees also came to check on us and see if we needed anything. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I ordered a cheese quesadilla which was delicious. The tortilla tasted and appeared to be homemade. My sister had the sour cream enchiladas which she really enjoyed. Prices were very reasonable. For our 2 meals and drinks we paid around $19. I would definitely go back.","Disgusting. Tasted like dog food. Waiter was definitely on something. AND he stunk. Gross. Will never, ever eat there again!","No chicken fingers or chicken nuggets for the little ones."],"business_id":"c0-q98sX3AEsiYKSVIukyQ","name":"El Charro Restaurant & Cocktail Lounge","categories":["Bars","Mexican","Nightlife","Lounges","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I love Mexican food and this place has become one of my favorites. They use a mesquite grill to cook the food and it provides great flavor to the meat. They also make fresh salsa everyday and offer it at a self serve station. The owner and staff are super friendly and the food comes out fast. The food has never disappointed us whenever we came here and I  highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it.","This is a great mexican restaurant. The tacos are amazing, the rice and beans are some of the best i have ever had. And the salsa was outstanding. I had the hottest red salsa and it added great flavor to my chicken tacos. I am quite impressed with this food and will return again and bring everyone I know!!\n\n*HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT*","Place is bomb,  from there breakfast burritos to their carne asada burros.  Staff was friendly and even let us sample to decide on what we want. Will return soon.","STARVING & NOT HAPPY! I'm giving 3 stars because it's not really the restaurant's fault that I waited over an hr for food that was never going to come. Don't order through the yelp app for delivery because A) they don't deliver and B) there is a huge DISCONNECT with the people/companies involved.  HUGE fail Eat Street, huge fail. What's worse is that it takes 3-5 bus days to get a refund?! Are you kidding me? Please get the information that's available to your customers right. Marketing is only as good as the information given. Let's try and keep that correct. Just a thought.  Especially useful if you don't want 'hangry' customers waiting for food that'll never come!","Delicious an refreshing take on classic mexican food .\nAuthentic Mexican Food tailored to spoil Americans :)\nMy new favorite spot","Seriously great food - the chicken was fabulous!!! This place is legit - gotta try it","Yummy!!! Since I moved to Chandler 4 months ago, Ive been looking for a great Mexican restaurant.  This little Mom & Pop place has Amazing Marinated Meats... I had the Tres Tacos (Chicken, Beef & Pork)... Too die for!  My new favorite Tex Mex!","A hidden gem in Chandler with some of the best carne asada I've ever had.  It was recommended on my first visit and I had it in a quesadilla.\n\nI was very happy that they also serve breakfast tacos all day.  The prices are very reasonable and I would put this food against any restaurant.","Smashed Chipotle by far. Enjoy eating here on all days. Taco Tuesday is just a start. Food is awesome.  Highly recommend it to all authentic Mexican food lovers. !!!!","First off I'll start off by saying that I really wanted to like this place as it is about a mile from my home. I usually stick to my local favorites but have scoped this place out while driving by and got a coupon in the mailer.  First things first when you first walk in the smell of the mesquite is a nice welcome, unfortunately it pretty much ends there. \n\nThere were 4 gentlemen ordering in front of me and basically 2 hard working workers taking care of the restaurant. Both were trying to make burritos near where you order while also cooking in the back as well as run the cash register. These guys were moving as fast as they could but were very disorganized (obviously a management issue). By the time I got to order I had been standing in line for over 10 minutes. While standing in line which seemed forever I noticed a few things. First the tortillas are store bought. The cooks literally opened up a shopping bag on the counter and pulled out clearly labeled for retail bags of tortillas (the bags had the government mandated nutritional info printed on them). After reading reviews of this place I noticed a few other Yelpers noticed this as well. I know that the majority of the \"Bertos\" Mexican places use locally made tortillas. So seeing this when I got to order I changed my order to breakfast Tacos (was originally going for a burrito) and hoped for the best. Also when waiting I noticed that the carne asada was nearly black on the outside (think jerkey) not juicy steak like you get at every run of the mill \"Bertos\". I also noticed that one of the cooks had a towel thrown over his shoulder and would use it to wipe down everything from the counter when food spilled on it to the prep areas where he would put down tortillas when someone ordered one. After working in a kitchen I know this is a no no per health code violations. \n\nMy coupon was buy any 2 breakfast items and a drink and get one item free. So this is were it gets bad fast. While ordering the cook says what are you in the mood for and  I said Im looking at the tacos which do you suggest and he says back the chorizo ones. He then tells me that they are all 99 cents during breakfast hours. So at the register now stands what I guess was the manager as he was wearing a Julias Mesquite Mexican Grill Polo and was pulling large sums of money in and out of the register. I handed him my coupon thinking 2 breakfast tacos at 99 cents plus a buck and a half for a drink (they didnt have any listed prices for any of the drinks they have) so I thought with tax Im walking out for less than $4 bucks. The manager then says this coupon is for the breakfast platters which I then look at the coupon and nope it says any 2 breakfast items. So he hastily rings me up and says my total was $6 and some change. So I tried to break down the simple math for him and said 2 tacos at 99 cents each plus the drink which he automatically charged me for a large is $4 bucks plus tax. He then tried to explain to me that the tacos are originally $1.89. I may not be have a math degree from Harvard but simple math is simple math. I asked him are the breakfast tacos 99 cents during breakfast and he said yes. They was a gentleman waiting behind me to pay and his food was ready so I just paid my tab. While waiting again (for my food) I was looking at the receipt and what he did was charge me for 2 full price tacos, not the breakfast pricing. I told the manager that he had over charged me which then continued to argue with me. So I asked him to see the coupon which I checked to see if it said anything that you had to pay the full menu price while ordering which it didnt. I know it was only a few bucks but I work hard for my money and just dont like giving it away and being over charged. I told the manager that I was going to write a review on Yelp which he responded that nobody reads those things. \n\nSo I finally get my breakfast tacos which had left a lot to be desired. They were very sloppy and greasy. I have eatin at almost every \"Bertos\" place in the valley and I know greasy lol but these were dripping with grease and coated my throat with a film. I only ate one which I braved though because I wanted to try the different kinds of salsa. Honestly if I didnt have an issue with the math in this place I would still not come back. With the store bought tortillas, the dried up meat (other Yelpers have said the same) and the cooks not being properly trained in the health codes, on top of it taking 20 plus minutes for me to order and receive 3 small breakfast tacos when there were only 4 people in front of me. There are plenty of other Mexican joints and your money and time are better spent else where. I know almost everyone rags on the \"Bertos\" places but my local one is fine dinning compared to this place.","Have eaten @ Julia's 4 or 5 times now, and they never disappoint!! If you're looking for a Mexican restaurant that has FLAVORFUL MEAT, look no further.\n\nBeef,  pork & chicken are mesquite grilled, providing a fabulous aroma that greets you in the parking lot. Chile verde pork & pollo adobado are favorites. Choose how you want to enjoy these meats--in tacos, a burrito, in a salad, or simply as a meat plate with beans & rice.\n\nHaven't tried breakfast yet, but they serve it! They also, surprisingly, serve hotdogs & hamburgers,  I guess for your friends who don't like Mexican food but want to hang with you!\n\nWhy are you still reading this? Get over there! You won't be sorry!","Real good Mexican food!!! And their burgers are amazing!!! I forsure recommended this new place!!!","super yummy and great service!!!","I'd give this place more stars if I could!!! Everything about this place is A Amazing. The food is so fresh and that smokey scent when you walk in crawls up your nose and welcomes you back everytime! I eat here at least 3 times a week and never get sick of the steak. The quesadilla is what originally got me hooked. LOOK, if your looking for \" your little spot\" for lunch or what have you, no better spot than here. I have yet to find another place for lunch and if this place keeps up, I never will :) KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!","This place is awesome! Friendly staff, and fantastic grub.  I had four soft tacos (steak)... They were delicious.  Good ingredients, made to order.  I have not been so impressed with similar small Mexican fast good joints ( like Filiberto's or Los Favoritos)... The quality at those places is not good, and sometimes the food is just questionable... Not so here!  Julia's rocks!","food is decent but english is the second language. my order has been messed up more than once so i stop going.","I've been all over the valley for tacos and this is the only place I know that cooks over mesquite wood (not charcoal). You can taste the difference and we will be back for more","Pretty interesting place, build your own burrito with a variety of delicious meats. \n\nWorth giving a try, very fresh ingredients.","went here for lunch once and as soon as you walk in the door there is a heavy mesquite smoke smell!! this is a GOOD thing!!! the food here is great! The staff was friendly and seemed to know the customer that came in and greeted them with a smile!!","This place is awesome for a good burrito.  Every morning they make fresh horchata and the breakfast burritos are made fresh on the grill.  Even though the portions are huge, I can't seem to get enough.  The employees are really friendly and a joy to be around.  I will be back frequently.","I absolutely love this place.  The owner and cool staff knows customer service.  The mesquite grill provide and amazing taste to the meat.  If you've never been here you have to try it.  The breakfast is great too!","Julia's knows hows to cook.  I've eaten there twice already, and I ordered the same thing, the Steak, Bacon and Egg breakfast burrito.  I'm sure everything else on the menu is just as good.  I'll have to try a burger next.","Always great food and friendly service. They have a large variety too. Burrito, tacos and quesadillas, as well as, sandwiches, burgers, and bratwurst. Also their portions are very big. Nachoes are huge! \n\nThe prices are the best part! Very affordable!","The food at this place is extremely good. I've been here for breakfast for almost 2 weeks in a row now. When I see the somebody in the back mixing the sauces from scratch and walking around with a huge crate of eggs - I know this place is fresh! And you can taste it! I get the Egg and Steak breakfast burrito every morning. I've had a couple other burritos and everything I've had is tasty. They are huge burritos. I've never been able to finish one. I actually split the burrito down the middle with a coworker every morning. He pays half, I pay half - that's 2 bucks for an awesome breakfast! ok... the slowness. I feel like it /feels/ slow more than it /is/ slow. Because of style of restaurant this appears to be (order at the counter - rather than a waiter) it can feel real slow because you might be expecting fast food. This is not fast food - this is real food - real good.","Good grilled burger spot. Nice smell of grilled goodness when you walk in. \n\nI tried the Green Chile Burger (they spell it with a chil\"i\" but that should be more for the chili you put on fries or chili dog). The burger seem to be about quarter pound in size, it had one large roasted green chile(be nice if it was more spicy) split in half,  nice thick cut bacon, pepper jack cheese lettuce onion and tomato. Very good burger (once i added mustard) didn't blow my mind but it was tasty and fresh.\n\nHad waffle fries which were good as well.\n\nPlace is very simple inside, fast food/order then pick-up type place with plenty of seating.\n\nI sampled the 6 salsas they had, they were pretty good as well (nothing real spicy though), i am gonna have to come back and try the Mexican food.","Me and my 2 sons are here eating and I'm telling you now the best in town they use mesquite wood for there meat !! Filibertos who????!","I figured I would give this new place a shot (It was formerly Flame Burger). When you first walk in the smell of the Mesquite grill is great. They have a nice selection of homemade salsa's at a self serve station. There's probably 6 different salsa's to choose from. I sampled 3 of them and they were all nice and fresh ranging in different heat levels. I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style (approx $8). It was really good. You can really taste the mesquite in the meat, the refried beans were amazing, they tasted like grandma made them from scratch. I'll definitely go back to try some other items!\n\nAs a bonus this place is family owned and I always like to support local small businesses.","This place is great. The staff is super accommodating.  I've been there a handful of times. Food is amazing. The carne asada is delicious and seasoned perfect. I love the barbacoa, it's tender and delish. Pricing is good, salsa bar is fresh, and kitchen it's clean. This is one of those consistent places that you'll get good food at.","This place reminds me of Chipotle, BUT BETTER! Everything about this place was a great experience. The food, the employees, and cleanliness. The salsa bar is delicious and the good is all fresh. I'm definitely coming back!","I am so glad I finally tired this place out. The food is very good and fresh. I ordered the 4 soft tacos each with a different meat, carnitas, grilled chicken, barbacoa, and steak.  All of the meats were very flavorful and moist. The steak was my favorite, all charcoaled on the outside and tender on the inside, delicious! My bf had the steak burrito which was also very tasty. Very good fresh homemade tortillas. \n\nIt is set up somewhat like Chipotle, where you go down the line and tell them what you want on your order. It is great that they also have a salsa bar. Service is very fast and friendly. Lobby was clean and welcoming. The owner himself was serving the food and was very nice. Great family ran local place to grab a quick bit for not a lot of money.","After our disaster at Chase's Diner (see review) we stopped in here to get breakfast.  Looks like they have not been open long but it was clean and adequately staffed, no line so are orders got in quickly.  The manager was running the cash register and was very polite and attentive.  Had the Chorizo breakfast burrito, it was large as burritos go,  hot, fresh and yummy!  Definitely come back to this place.","Howdy Az Foodies\n\nDon't you just love driving down the road scoping out new places and promising to one day try them.... and then  you finally do?\n\nThat's how this review will start... I went to get a burger from a place that used to be a burger shop but apparently is now this mesquite mexican and burger place?\n\nThis piqued my interest.... it's kind of like mixing an italian restaurant with a chinese restaurant...\n\nI go to a mexican restaurant to get mexican food and a burger place to get a burger...but who knows... maybe they do make a good burger?  Never got the chance to find out what any of it tastes like..\n\nIt started like this... I walked in and there was 2 people ahead of me.\n\nA nice man...looked like a manager/owner?.... greeted us and as they took orders found they didnt have the carne adasa or rice therefore they stopped production and went to chop up meat and find rice and no idea what else because we all just stood there waiting while this young female employee stood there looking dumbfounded!\n\nThe beans sat there on the tortillas on the work area waiting for ingrediants to arrive...I should mention at this  time that they took the tortillas out of a grocery store plastic bag!  I was hoping maybe they made their own?\n\nAfter standing in this line 10 minutes I politely said to the dumbfounded girl... \" I have been waiting too long and I think I will leave\"  I said Thank You and left.\n\nTo be fair I know they opened not too long ago, so i think i will wait a few months until they have their act together to possibly...maybe try again...\n\nNot sure they will be there months from now if they dont made some serious changes.\n\nGood luck to you Julia's....\n\nAnd to the rest of you......\n\nBon Appetite'","Tried every breakfast taco on the menu cause they were cheap,  I was particularly hungry and couldn't make up my mind. Wasn't disappointed on any one. I surprisingly ate the lot!  Lol.  The homemade salsa bar was really good, a lot of flavor With just the right amount of spice. My wife had the cheeseburger and loved it.","Never judge a book by its cover.. This place is amazing!!! I have been back multiple times and haven't been disappointed. Tacos, burritos and burgers are all outstanding.","Coming from Texas I'm very suspicious that I'm going to get a store bought tortilla when eating Mexican food in Arizona. I had a feeling the carnivore type tacos would have an awesome mesquite flavor but I didn't get to try it this time around.\n\nIt doesn't have a drive thru but it's a real simple to order take out or eat in. My hunt was for a breakfast burrito still served anytime of the day. I ordered a burrito with eggs,ham,potatoes, beans, and cheese. The smell of the wonderful mesquite makes me want to come back for a burger or taco which I well. Anyhow, I got my salsa at the salsa bar while waiting and I receive my to go order shortly after. I left and in the car open the burrito and to my surprise a homemade tortilla with fresh ingredients still at 11:30am. The reason from my 5 is the homemade tortillas with all the goodness inside.","I LOVE this place.  The food is a cross between Mexican and bbq - trust me, it's a glorious union.  The carne asada is amazing, everything I have tried had been good.","Gave this place a try a few days ago and I gotta' say, WOW.Upon entering,I was greeted by the manager and an associate immediately.I was having a hard time deciding what to order for dinner so the manager gave me samples of all the meats.Their chile rojo is one of the best I have ever had.Reminded me of my mom's cooking as a kid.I loved it.I ordered the 4 tacos for $5.99 and decided to get two of em' with the chili rojo and the other two with chicken.Their chicken was truly one of a kind.My gf ordered a burrito for $5.99 and it was so huge and tasted soo good too.I am definitely goin' back there soon.The service and food was great.A++","Oh my goodness! I can't wait to come back here! Their meats are grilled over a mesquite fire. My street tacos were amazing, my daughter's quesadilla was great and my hubby's burger was awesome. I went there because of the smell outside and I'm so glad I did!!!","Great food..worth stopping! Friendliest staff ever...Great marinated pork burritos! Don't pass it up!","We recently discovered this place since they moved to their new location at Warner/Arizona.  Love it. Everything is fresh and so good, but my husband and I have gotten hooked on getting taco salads there, and run over there about once a week.","Big fan of this place. Awesome breakfast tacos. Awesome owner. Good stuff. 99 cent tacos baby! Can't beat that!","First time in and had the Green Chili Burger. Just want to say that it was AWESOME!!!","This place smells great: mesquite grilling.  Brought out the carnivore in me and was rewarded by ordering the asada burrito enchilada style with verde sauce.  Yum!  Manager very friendly and accommodating.  Had items on menu for my vegetarian friend as well.  I look forward to trying other choices but the steak asada is definitely the way to go here.","This place is great!!!  The meats are all very good and the salsa bar has a great selection!\nThe guacamole is the BOMB!!  Definitely a must have!!"],"business_id":"cscosdWU2MaSJ-snEaDieg","name":"Julia's Mesquite Mexican and Burgers","categories":["Burgers","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Service here is always friendly, and it's a pleasant place that offers a lot of fish for the buck. Go for fish over lobster or shrimp, as you get more food for the buck, and it tastes good going down. Plus, salsa bar! They've added dessert, and the coconut-lime bars are really good. Not so good is the sangria, which has a strange cardboard background taste.\n\nWhy two stars? Well, it doesn't taste so good coming back up. Five hours later, it all did, and the problem lasted for 24 hours. That matches food poisoning with that meal as the source. It's too bad, as I enjoyed the meal while it was happening, but this is a risk I wouldn't take again.","I love Rubios! I have only had a few things here, but I have recently been getting the Grilled Veggie Burrito and it has been salivatingly delicious each time, so I have praise it. If you want something meatless, yet savory, this burrito hits the spot. You also gotta love the salsa bar.","J and I are fans of the Fish Tacos here.  And we usually only go on Tuesday when they're $1.50 a piece. Dinner for the 2 of us for under $9.00, not too shabby!!!  \n\nJ is a fan of the hot carrots they have at the salsa bar. It usually never fails when I go, I'm scavenging for the last few slices from the two containers. So I casually mentioned, \"You know, you guys should have a separate container just for carrots!\" The lady informed me that they do not make their hot carrots (I was under the impression they did), but that they come from a can that has both the chilis and carrots. She then said, \"Let me go open a new can and get you some.\" Sweet!!! Well, more like HOT!! :) \n\nArcadia Rubio's, you're a-okay in my book!  Especially on Taco Tuesdays! :)","Alright ,so I have been here a time or two. Maybe about 20 times to be exact.\nEvery time I have ever been here, I have never been dissapointed.\nThis place is great!\nThe food is great, the service is good and fast.\nThe place is spotlessly clean. They seem to always be busy.\nThey are busy I am sure because,everyone feels the way that I do.\nThis place is great!\nI really like all the different salas they offer and you can have as much as you like!\nThank you Rubios for always being delish! As well as always being fresh and having really great tasting fish tacos.","It's been a while since i've been to a Rubio's mainly because the closest one to me is 187miles away! So I went to this location and the girl who served me was Lorena. She greeted me as I walked in and was ready to serve me in 30secs. I had trouble ordering because what I wanted wasn't on the board. (Mesquite Shrimp tacos) I mentioned that I didn't see it and she told me it was no longer on the menu but she could still make it for me! She charged me accordingly and i had exactly what i came for in a matter of 5 minutes! Thanks to the friendly staff and quick service!","Happy National Guacamole Day!\n\nI'm a huge guac fan, so being that today really is National Guac Day, I knew I had to \"get me some.\" Despite a crazy work schedule and very limited time, I made it happen with a quick visit to Rubio's!\n\nSure, they are a chain, but I do love their fast casual style, friendly employees, salsa bar, and best of all, great selection and quality food considering the prices.  I got myself a salad with shrimp, a large guac and chips to share with the fam, and a kids meal for my son... \n\nNot only was the food delicious, but the kids meal is a great deal.  For under $5, the meal includes your choice of entree (chicken quesadilla was my choice today), your choice of side (from applesauce, chips, beans or rice), a churro, and a small drink.  \n\nEverything was a hit at my house, and I won't hesitate to return to Rubio's sooner than later when I'm in the mood for a quick fix of Mexican!","I'm a huge fan and love this place, every time I come in I'm alway greeted by my name with a smile from everyone. Especially Lorena. She knows my order by heart and and is always super friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's no wonder I come so often;) thank you Lorena for always making my experience great!","Went for the first time not long ago, which is crazy because I'm obsessed with fish tacos. One of my good friends always talks them up but I just never got around to going. Grilled fish taco was great as was the orange shrimp salad. Quick for take out, reasonably priced, good service. I liked the little salsa bar too always a plus. I'll be going back!","Far from authentic but fish taco Tuesdays is money well spent. Especially since their only $1.25. I usually get about 4 fish taco's on flour tortilla's with extra onions. I pour on their delicious hot salsa from the 4 option salsa bar and go to town. I have tasted their specialty shrimp burrito's and if it wasn't for the price, I would order it more often. For now, my wallet thanks me.","The food is consistently fresh and delicious.","I came here for the fish tacos... but likely won't be back. I prefer mine lightly battered and these were pretty heavily breaded and fried. The first two bites didn't even have fish in them, just breading. They do have different varieties, so maybe some of the other kinds are better?","This is a great place to grab a quick meal or pick up dinner or your way home.  It's fast, not too expensive, and the good tastes good.","Fish Tacos go against everything mi abuelita from East L.A. would have stood for. \"Who puts fish in a taco, mi hijo?\" she would have said. But sometimes I'm just jonesin' for some I can't help but jump in my car to pick some up (with flour tortillas)\nThey're just so tasty. \n\nOther times I'm in the mood for a carne asada quesadilla. The steak is a little dry but it goes well with the sour cream guacamole and pico de gallo that it's served with. I love me some of their roasted chipotle sauce too.\n\nThe service here is always friendly and efficient. The parking in the strip mall they're at can be hit or miss but it's worth it.","The food is good, the service is okay. \n\nIt's good if you want some cheap food that isn't terrible, but in the area I think there is definitley some better mexican good. \n\nI don't like the chicken they use, so I try to avoid anything with that on their menu!","When I used to work in downtown Phoenix, I would sometimes make the drive out to 44th and Indian School just to get me some fish tacos. The staff is pretty friendly here, it's a large space with a great patio, and clean! \n\nWhile I have a wealth of Mexican to choose from in AZ, I really do love Rubios, chain or not. I've been going to them all over the Valley since they first started opening. Solid menu, cheap, and satisfying. Love their salsa bar. $1.50 fish tacos, burros under $5, mmmmmm.","Extremely disappointed.  I have frequented this Rubio's for years.  \n\nOn my last visit there ever, I  watched every second of the near Halloween horror:  my carry out order was brought to another table, to an elderly couple who were obviously dining in.  When the front counter guy asked if they were carrying out, they said they didn't care.  \n\nI watched them open the carry out boxes.  I watched them take the boxes to the salsa counter.  I watched them take a bite from the boxes.  I watched them shut the boxes when the counter guy realized that he brought them the wrong order when their order was finally ready and called out at the front counter.  \n\nI WATCHED IN HORROR AS HE RAN OVER TO THEIR TABLE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY RECEIVED THE WRONG ORDER, AND HE CLOSED  THEIR BOXES AND BROUGHT THEM TO MY TABLE AND HANDED THEM TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI was.....horrified.  I was in shock.  I said:  um, I'm not taking that if they put stuff on it, and I know they put stuff on it and took a bite.  \n \nThe counter guy opened up the box and said, I don't see any stuff on it.  it is fine.\nHe closed the box and handed it back to me.  \n \nAnother customer walked passed me and I glanced at him in horror, hoping to get some kind of compassion and sympathy.  He stared back at me with no emotion.\n \nI turned to the counter guy and said, I really don't want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it.  He says, I don't see that they put anything on it.  It's fine.  And he laughed.  It doesn't matter to me if he laughed at me or thought it was funny, but it was NOT funny.\n \nI walk out of the store DAZED and IN SHOCK with the two boxes.  \n \nNever in my life, even in the dirtiest grossest restaurant have I blatantly experienced anything like this.\n \nWhen I got home, I opend the box to microwave the hell out of the plates thinking I would give it to my dogs;  and there was a foot long hair EMBEDDED across both tacos which I slowly pulled out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! \n \nI can not even make this S*IT UP!!!!!!!\n \nI will never, ever go back there ever again.  Good luck suckers.  I hope you take your Cipro. You get what you pay for.   Never ever again.  \n \nThe only plus was that it was free taco weekend, and the counter guy gave me a free taco, which I threw away after gagging pulling out the embedded hair.  \n \nFor years, the service was friendly and excellent.  What happened?  :(\n \nI'm on my way to Baja Loco.","I love this Rubio's! The staff here is really nice and remembers you if you're here often enough. The food is always fresh. Taco Tuesdays ($1.50 for a fish taco) is amazing! The salsa is fresh, the food is great, and the staff seems like they actually care if you're having a good experience. I've been to local restaurants and gotten fish tacos that weren't as good as the ones at Rubio's. Plus they have beer. Go and get some!","This is the best Rubio's I have been to. \n\nThe standard good:\nTacos- steak, chicken, grilled fish, breaded fish, shrimp, all yummy\nIce cold beer\nHelp yourself to the Salsa Bar with fresh cut lemons, limes, and jalepeños, too.\n\nThis location's extra goodness:\nCute Tiki patio...huge lighted tiki umbrella, and at least one other smaller tiki umbrella. I forget to take pix a lot, sorry! \nExceptional customer service- especially the two dark hair young women. The cashier and the expo girl worked very well together. They served food to customers, kept everything clean, were quick and efficient during the lunch rush and did everything with a smile. I wish I knew their names to mention.\n\nTry the new mango habenero ono taco! \n\nGood place if you have children.","We go here often for an after-church lunch. There are several families who go, and some of the kids don't like the food here, but Rubio's is kind enough to let us bring in food from other restaurants. This is a huge point in their favor.\n\nThe food is quite good, really. I love the fish tacos, and the chipotle salsa is fabulous! The service is efficient. I love the decor-lots of blues and greens, but it is a chain, so it's not really artsy or surprising.\n\nAll in all, a nice place for a good meal!","I never eat here. I ate at Rubio's once many years ago and hadn't been back because I thought it was ho-hum. I had some Free Taco cards and I'm glad they took them, they were a little old. No expiration on the cards, no catches, just FREE TACO.\n    I ordered 4 tacos. They have a new Ono Taco which is mango habanero! I tried a free half taco in line from the gal. I liked it so much I ordered two! The flavor was huge, but the size a bit small for the retail price. I ate one Ono Taco in a few bites. Rubios has definitely ramped it up since I was in last. For those who don't know, when in Hawaii, \"ono\" is the word for scrumptious when describing food. Ono char siu pork was the order of the day when I was a kid visiting my friend there. I also ordered two fish especial tacos. Delicious with the avocado. The winning accents came from the salsa bar! The two dark salsas were COMPLETE FLAVOR WIN. Smokey chile sauces will always win me over, so glad they had those and not some boring jar-like salsa. I was hoping for some pico salsa, but they didn't have any there. Anyway with four tacos I left full. Maybe you're thinking \"You SHOULD be full after four, you pig!\" Yeah. Indulge yourself when possible and practical, I say!\nRetail price for all 4 including tax was over $15! Ouchies! Flavor explosion, but pricey. That's OK, I don't expect that for cheap, but if I were to make a $10 choice I might choose Chipotle or Qdoba ($8 for a full-on deluxe burrito) or Pei Wei. Glad this was a free lunch. I would say go to Rubios if you have a coupon, don't pay full-on retail. Looks like a previous reviewer says there's a Tuesday deal? Here it is:\nAfter 2:30 pm on Tuesday is \"Taco Tuesday\" and fish tacos are $1.50 each.","Perfect shrimp tacos. Great flavors. Very inexpensive. Nice break from baja fresh and chipotle. Flavors are more authentic mexican. We went back twice we liked it so much.","Usually I am a fried chicken kind of guy, but today, I had a taste for something different, so I decided to try Rubio's. The food was great, but the prices were a little high. I will certainly go back, just not every day, given these prices.","this is another one of those check-in Nag reminders.  So, I'll write something up.  I don't eat fish, but my wife does, and she loves the fish taco's here.  Kids usually get a burrito of some sort, I get the salad with chicken strips on it.  First, the good.  Love the salsa bar.  It's always fresh and there are plenty of condiments.  The chips are always good, light, salty, not greasy - they should give you more though.  They serve beer here!  And they serve Mexican beers, another plus.  (now the bad) My salad, however, was pretty much industrial-quality.  The lettuce was not fresh, the chicken, I dunno, I actually don't want to think about where it came from.  there was some sort of chipotle-ranch dressing on some of the leaves, but not enough to make an impression.  I spiced it up with some salsa and marinated carrots from the salsa bar - that really helped to add some flavor.  My youngest had a kids meal that included a churro.  I've never had one of those, so I took a bite.  It was like a giant stick of cinnamon-flavored licorice - as in cinnamony, sugary, gummy and chewy all at the same time, with an aftertaste of pre-fabrication that left me feeling kinda like I don't wanna do that again.  \n\nThe dining room is clean, the staff is nice, and they try to play the beach-cantina vibe, but in the end, it's fast food and this Rubios is more than likely just like that Rubios, except in a different zip code.","I am a big fan of fish tacos, some people cringe at the thought, but that's because they have never had a fish taco from here. Rubio's by far has the best fish taco, it is absolutely delicious. After 2:30 pm on Tuesday is \"Taco Tuesday\" and fish taco's are $1.50/ea.","This is the best Rubio's in town.  The employees and management are so friendly and accommodating.   I am on the Hcg diet and they work with me to make things I can eat.  Every time I am in Old Town for an appointment I make sure it is around lunch time so I can go to this Rubio's.   The place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here.  Shout out to Steven, he is really nice to all customers.","Tonight we were hungry and wanted to try something new\nRubios interior is really cute and reminded me of Taco Cabana\nThe cashier really made our entire experience great\nShe helped us with menu options and she was very talkative\nShe made it fun and very helpful at the same time\nShe is a great employee\nI wish I had gotten her name but she is a young lady\nWe really enjoyed the food that we got and I was very surprised\nI also really liked the chili/salsa bar \nI love chili\n\nI will return to Rubio's","I'm here way too often, more than I'd like to admit.\n\nMy boyfriend and I love the food. We love the staff.\n\nIt's not always easy taking our picky a** orders. And, they always get them right with a smile.\n\nNot too long ago we were by the location on Ray Rd.\nWe decided not to go just because we love this location far too much to \"cheat\".\n\nWe're always at comfort here and leave with a satisfied tummy.","Ya know, just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation, Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my (frequent) inexpensive taco/burrito cravings.\n\nChipotle obviously has the burrito game on lock. I just won't order one anywhere else, it won't measure up.  El Pollo Loco's grilled chicken is phenomenal, as are their salsas, and Sonora Mesquite Grill has the most amazing Carne Asada I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth, so I'm covered there also. Now, you may be thinking to yourself \"This girl really has it figured it. What void in her life could Rubio's possible fill that she has to add it to an already stellar line up of very well thought out and eloquently presented Mexican casual dining options?\"  To that I say: Fish Tacos.\n\nI'm not saying that Rubio's has the best Fish Tacos in the world. I may be an expert on a lot of things, but sadly Fish Tacos isn't one of them. But Rubios' are good, and their tomatillo salsa is tasty and, as previously mentioned, they carry Coke Zero which is just so ridiculously head and shoulders above Diet Coke I'm surprised its market hasn't been completely cannibalized by now. I guess some people just enjoy barely-carbonated cola beverages that have the aftertaste of battery acid. But I digress.\n\nI'm going to let you guys in on a little secret: Chicken Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad.  Grilled chicken (not El Pollo Loco quality, but it's fair), avocado, and roasted veggies over lettuce with a tangy balsamic dressing. A good portion as long as you're not famished, and really quite tasty. Here's the secret: 310 Calories. For the whole thing, none of that \"without dressing, avocado, chicken, or anything that tastes good\" bull (I'm looking at you Subway).  I like to dip the chicken in tomatillo salsa, which might add like 5 calories to the deal, but I'm okay with it because I'm still saving about 400 calories which can now be put towards a more noble purpose: Booze! So, Rubio's, take a seat in the line up. If for the sake of the booze and the booze alone, you've earned it.","I just had a fantastic bean and cheese burrito.  The tortilla was so fresh and tasty.  The beans were creamy and well spiced.  There was the perfect amount of cheese.  The meal was fast was well priced and the staff was friendly.  The atmosphere was pleasant and clean.  Great place!!!","I finally realized I was addicted to the shrimp burritos when I dreamed about eating one.......if loving a burrito is wrong, I don't wanna be right.\n\nPS - If the Big D does not open a Rubios soon, I may have to consider relocating.","Gross!  Their tortilla soup tasted like vomit.  After two spoons full I proceeded to throw up in the bathroom!  NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN!","Was driving around after doing some Christmas 'browsing' and really didn't know what I wanted to eat. Wanted to try someplace new.....saw Rubio's and ended up trying it. \n\nSmall and clean restaurant. Ordered from their menu board placed over the register area. Decided on the Carnitas Rajas burrito. \n\nSince I was the only one there at the time the food came out extremely fast. \n\nAll the ingredients of the burrito did indeed seem fresh....but as a whole the dish didn't do much for me. There was a chimichurri sauce in the burrito that kind of overpowered everything else. I think I would have liked it better without the sauce. \n\nI did try the roasted chipotle salsa from the salsa bar and found that very, very good. Nice dark and rich salsa with a chocolaty after taste.It doesn't taste anything like it looks. When was the last time you thought.....\"Hmm....I'm in the mood for some food that's colored black.\" \n\nSo I may try it again sometime in the future and get the carnitas burrito without the chimichurri sauce.....but with the roasted chipotle salsa instead. That sounds a lot better. \n\nI'm giving this 3 stars because it was right in the middle of the road for me. Nothing great, nothing awful. I will probably try it out again but order something different than what I had tonight.","When I moved to Dallas in 05, one of the first things I looked for upon my arrival was a Rubio's. Imagine my shock and total dismay to find out that the Big R had not migrated out here to the Big D yet...... \n\nSo on a visit back to see the fam last week, I made multiple stops at Rubio's and stocked up on the magnificent fish tacos and the shrimp burritos. One of my friends asked me (on the third visit) if I had gotten sick of Rubio's yet....I looked at him like he was from another planet. Sick of Rubio's? Could he really be serious????  Besides the great food, reasonable prices and friendly staff, this fast food joint sells Corona beers...what more could one ask for?","Ya know, I just love this place.\n\nIt ain't fancy, but the food is always solid, and the people that work there are very friendly.  I appreciate someone that has a smile on their face at work!\n\nLast night, my 'seester' and I decided to go there.  They don't have Rubio's in Prescott, so she almost always wants to go when she's here.\n\nRight now they have several langostino lobster items.  Run, don't walk, to your nearest Rubios and try them.  Oh.  My.  Gawd....  My sis and I both got the surf and turf taco platter.  The lobster taco has incredible -- garlicy lobster chunks, shredded cabbage, onion, and cilantro.  It was truly wow-worthy.  The steak taco was pretty damn good too.  It was kind of cool -- they bake the cheese onto the corn tortilla -- so it gets sort of chewy.  It was AWESOME.  It also has bacon bits (life just isn't worth living without bacon), and this chipotle crema on it.  Woo-freakin-hoo!\n\nDuring our meal the manager came over to our table to check on us.  She wanted to see what we thought of the lobster.  It was just nice that she wanted to know we were happy with our food.  How refreshing!","Oh, Rubio's! How I love thee! You must put crack in your fish tacos because I think I am addicted. I have no need to try anything else at your fine establishment because the sun rises and sets upon your glorious fishy goodness. Have I had better fish tacos? Almost certainly yes. But there is some indefinable feature of your tacos that draws me back again and again. I feel almost embarrassed by how much I care for you, Rubio's fish taco. But I don't care. I wish the whole world to know how great you are. You had me at first bite. So long for now Rubio's fish taco, but I will be there soon to enjoy your company once more.","Decent, gringoized Mexican fare served in a clean establishment. Perfectly edible, but for my money, I prefer to go to a real Mexican joint, of which there are many around here. This is the place to take your midwestern parents who think they like Mexican food but really don't have a clue. Last time I tried the place they had discontinued the non-fried fish tacos, which had IMO been the best food in the place.  Too bad.","This rating is on a scale of fast food restaurants and on that scale, Rubio's is pretty much top notch.  The fish tacos are delicious and the sauces are all tasty, especially the verde salsa...yummy.  There are not too many \"healthy\" options that are that tasty, but it definitely beats the fattiness of Baja Fresh any day.  If we are in a hurry and in an area with Rubio's, it is my pick.  It would be so much better if Texas was invaded by Rubio's instead of Taco Del Mar.","Probably my favorite of the breakout of \"fresh-mex\" type places.   This place is very similar in layout to a Baja Fresh, except they haven't sold their soul to Wendy's like Baja Fresh did.  \n\nThe quality of food here is really good.   I especially enjoy the carne asade tacos with a little salsa verde on it.   Thinking about it makes me want to go get some right now, except that it's about 930, and they're likely closed.  I never get the guac, but I've been told it's very fresh and very good.","Visiting Phoenix from the East Coast, I wanted to savor some authentic West Coast fish tacos.  When I asked where I could find the best, I was pointed to Rubio's. Wow!  I knew with my first bite that I had found heaven!  I had the Original and my hubby had the Especial.  Both were very yummy!  If you're looking for great fish tacos, look no further than Rubio's. \n\nThe service was great, the restaurant was clean, parking was easily accessible, and the prices were very reasonable. Can't ask for anything more!"],"business_id":"edjCywtqffQ8__vM7POZbw","name":"Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Went here on the recommendation of my bartender as they called last call at the bar on Saturday, and I was not disappointed.  He recommended the Arizona Burrito, which had potatoes and carne asada, among other items, and it was fantastic.  We also ordered carne asada fries, and those were good, too.  Perfect late night Mexican food, though slightly overpriced.","I'm in love with their super nachos. I think I gain weight just thinking about them. Seriously.","I've driven past this place several times and finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  After browsing their menu, I decided to order:\n\nCarne Asada Burrito, $4.75\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw#eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw\n\nBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $4.00\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ#WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ\n\nWhile I waited for my food, I went to load up on Salsa.  They have a typical Salsa Bar that you find out here in the Phoenix area Taco shops.  I tried the spicy Salsa and the roasted Peppers Salsa.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA#qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg#AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg\n\nAfter a short wait my food was ready.  The Burritos are pretty large and come with Chips...that was an unexpected bonus.  Before I jumped into the Burritos, I tried the Chips...they were stale, yuck.\n\nI then went for the Carne Asada Burrito....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  There was very little flavor to it.  Ok, another bite....and then another.  Wow, this was the blandest Carne Asada Burrito I've ever had.  Another unique thing was that the Burrito had grilled Onions and Salsa in it....very runny for a Burrito like this.  However, that didn't help with the flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I only ate 1/2 of it.\n\nNext, I tried the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito....again, it was underwhelming and bland.  I poured the spicy Salsa and Roasted Peppers Salsa on it to give it some flavor....that was it's only saving grace.\n\nOverall, it was a very disappointing dining experience.  Oh well, it happens sometimes.\n\nReturn Factor - 2%","A friend and I were visiting from San Diego and decided to get some burritos. This was the first place we spotted on the side of the road. Maybe Arizona Mexican food is different than California Mexican food but the burritos were not great at all. I got the chile reano burrito and it had nothing but the chile and guacamole in it. I was expecting maybe beans and cheese too but nope. My friend got the carne asada and it had nothing but meat in it. We also had to wait a really long time in the drive through when there was no one ahead of us or in the actual restaurant. It was 2 am and I feel like I shouldn't have to wait that long. Won't be a go to spot next time I'm in the area.","DONT GO HERE!\nI got stomach upset after I ate their carne asada burrito. The standard is not as Filbertoes or Riva's.\n\nSTAY AWAY","It was around 1am, after exploring the dives along the South side of Old Town and many cervesas later, we were strolling along and the smell of food came to my senses and low and behold to my left was the Super Burrito!  I had flashbacks from college to a joint called Burritos As Big As Your Head and I had to give it a try!  We walked in the door and, how appropriate, there was a guy stoned out of his brains waiting to dive into some late-night Mexican grub Hahah!  \n\nIt also was very apparent to me because I am a bit of 'clean freak', that the place was very sterile...stainless steel counter tops, open view to the kitchen, clean tile floors...few 24hour places ever look that clean (I have only been here once but I hope it is always like that-extra kudos).  So I walk to the counter and the friendly gentleman asked me what I was hungry for and I had no idea!  So he gave me a brief tour of the menu and I opted for the Super Nachos to share with mi Amigo!  It came covered in lots of yummy carne asada and they added lots of pico de gallo for me, and then we topped it with various fresh salsa from the salsa bar.  And because the street tacos, our stoner neighbor was chowing down on, looked sssooooooo good I had to try two of them too!  FYI the carne asada is better than the carnitas.  We did not go home hungry that early Saturday 'morning'!  \n\nAs you would expect at such a place, the prices are very reasonable, but what sets this place apart for me was the cleanliness and great service...oh yeah and the food is good, but what isn't at the wee hours of the morning  :)","always amazing food!! the salsa is the best!","UPDATE March 22, 2013: Scrumptious burrito, kinda greasy but yummy. They seem to have new people every time I come in including the chef, but whoever helps is very nice. I'll bump this review to 3 stars for now.\n\nLate March addition: Late night scrumptious. WIN. The steak and chorizo breakfast burrito is heavy and delicious! Grab a variety of sauces.\n-------------------------------------\nI gave two tries for a chile relleno burrito at Super Burrito. One was last week when I heard about the change in ownership, the next was last night. The first, there was only a strip of green chile, no batter or cheese, there was a little pico I think, and then it was half-stuffed with lettuce and it was STILL a thin burrito. Last night I told them about this, and they made sure they did it to their standard. Ingredients were better represented, but BARELY so. Also while I was at the counter, a guy returned his styro-packaged dish with a complaint in spanish I didn't quite understand and grimmace. I won't get a relleno burrito from there again. \nFiesta Burrito does that one RIGHT. Big green chiles and ample cheese.\nYou get TWO rellenos at Fiesta.\nSB gives one and lots of lettuce.\n\nThe main redeeming factors for Super Burrito is that they're open 24 hours, and the selection of salsas and hot sauces from the bottle are BOMBERIFFIC!!! The dark red salsa is smokey red. Try the varieties of bottled sauces from the tub. You've had Cholula and Tapatio and maybe El Yucateco habanero sauce, but try some of the other small bottle dark orange sauces you've never seen before. My mouth is watering now just thinking of them. I wrote the brands on a napkin, but I can't remember them. You'll see. You can dump some in a to-go Solo container, feel free.\nThey also have the traditional thin Berto's red sauce up front.\n\nSuper Burrito has become the girlfriend that is losing interest in you by not caring as much. However at 3AM you tolerate the mediocre sex cuz she's always ready for you. However lately that's REALLY a good thing to have something ready for you that will satisfy.","How many times have I rolled up on this spot at 3:30am to get a Arizona/california burrito.  hmmmm...  steak, cheese, pico, and home fried potatos and the thing is gigantic. $4 you cant beat it.\n\nthis place is EXACTLY the same as Rivas.  Actually all these 24 hour burrito places in valley are all the same.\n\nlove them.","I swung by Super Burrito after I dropped the baby off at daycare this morning.  Figured I'd try a chorizo and egg burrito.  While it was greasy, I didnt think it was SO greasy that it would trigger a Non-Gallbladder attack.  I was wrong.  So. Very. Wrong.  \n\nIf I'm ever in the need of a full colon-cleansing, I'll return to Super Burrito.","Decent Enough Burrito would be a more appropriate name for this place, but you can't blame taco-slingin' restaurateurs for aiming high. On the good side, they offer have slightly bland but passable interpretations of Mexican-inspired fast food. Little miniature tacos for a dollar is a fine deal, allowing you to sample a fine variety of meats in your meal, especially important since pastor is offered. And there's a little salsa bar too, which is a huge bonus for capsaicin junkies, as there's nothing worse than having to plead for an extra couple cups of sauce from stingy taco makers. Can metered doses of hot sauce really be cutting into profit margins? Maybe if the cups were a little bigger, I wouldn't need five of them. Anyhow, with salsa bar, go to town. Get reckless. \n\nIt's not all smiles around here, however. The glory of a taco shop lies partially in its propensity to serve up your grub lickity split, but Super Burrito does not subscribe to this philosophy at all. Super Burrito took an astoundingly, amazingly long time. There was only one other customer in the restaurant too, which compounded our confusion. I felt forgotten and unloved, and if I had known about the wait, I would have brought a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Nonetheless, the food does the trick and its available around the clock, meaning you could do worse than Super Burrito.","yes, if you're looking for something super expensive and fancy, or somewhere to take a date, you'll be out of luck here.\n\nbut if you want a hole-in-the-wall mexican place, i feel like this one can't be beat. huge portions, cheap prices, and there's just something about it i can't place. i just love it so.\n\nits breakfast burritos are always there for me if I need them (chorizo, but also poke a hole in the bottom of the burrito before you start eating it because you're going to want a way for the oil to drip out as you eat it). The carne asada fries have helped me through many a boring saturday. by that i mean if i was bored on a saturday afternoon, i would eat them and then take a nice long nap through the afternoon. if you can stay awake after a portion that size, you're probably on meth. \n\nanyway, i'm always going to love this place. i hope the family running it finds a way to get rich off of this.","It's Friday...strike that, Saturday morning.  I have one mud covered high heel.  I have had a few vodkas, so have my friends.  We took a cab, but that doesn't stop us from getting a burrito.  I buy one for the cab driver too since he was nice enough to turn off the meter and didn't mind that my shoe was extremely dirty.  \n\nThe pastor taco is delicious.  The chorizo burrito is delicious.  The bean and cheese burrito is delicious, not that you can mess up something that simple.  The guy behind the counter is super and puts up with my drunken food requests (basically, that means adding sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo to everything).  It also helps that my best friend speaks fluent Spanish and that the counter guy has a crush on me.\n\nSuper burrito is not only great for drunk binge eating, but also for awkward heart to hearts with your friends.  If you can't say it over burritos on the patio, when can you say it?  It reminds me of those 'chew it over with Twix' commercials, only you shove a burrito in your mouth instead of candy bars.","My go-to spot for breakfast burritos. Although prices went up recently, they are still reasonable. Drive through makes it easy to pick up a quick meal on the way to work in the morning but if you go inside there's a salsa bar.","so i wake up from my power nap with a super craving for chicken enchiladas. after talking my boyfriend into going with me on the epic hunt for food we take a drive to super Burrito i have never had before). Upon arrival we ordered a carne asada burrito, an order of beef enchiladas (for him) , and an order of chicken enchiladas (for me) with a medium coke. Pulling up to the window we wait and then receive our food. We stopped a few more places after that at the request of the boy and by the time we arrived back i sweating and breathing heavier than a fat girl at a chili fest. I opened the first take out box to find.....beef enchiladas. I opened the second box and found......CHEESE!?!?!? I definitely did not order cheese, that's like going to a burger place and being handed a bun with a slice of cheese. Wheres my damn patty?!?! So here i sit still hungry and now super aggravated.","Good source to Kill your Carne Asada Burrito hunger!  this thing is big and cheap... real steak sliced up and well grilled (upon request) I always eat it california style which is to have everything including rice and beans inside. I do it \"dry\" style which is no sauce/gravy on top... that way I can pick it up, dump some hot sauce on it and crush it!  this place is open late, in fact 24 hours i believe... I have gone there at all hours of the morning only to find the food cheap and cheerful. The help is friendly, but the bar crowd have pretty much destroyed the bathroom so dont expect much in that department.","Ok Super Burrito, you were chosen randomly to be the first Mexican food I had since moving here a few weeks ago. Our relationship is not set in stone yet but our first date was so brief I hardly had time to get to know you. \n\nLet's start with the food, pretty tasty though I could've done without the guacamole and sour cream on my carne asada fries. I did not know what came on the fries beyond the description in the name itself and the guy taking my order didn't offer to say. Moving on...they were tasty and I was not too disappointed in letting you be my first \"Arizonian Mexican Food\". \n\nOn to the service, I was greeted in Spanish so I ordered in Spanish. However I am quickly realizing that the Spanish I speak is what they call Castilian and it happens to be a different dialect than what most people here speak. So I did my best to keep it short and so did you. Anyways while the food was cooking I was explaining your menu to my husband and came across the part about you cooking brains and tongues. Well I decided to ask if you knew where I could find anticuchos, which are marinated chunks of beef heart roasted over an open flame, and you looked at me very very strangely and said you didn't know what I was talking about. I suppose Mexican cooks stopped just short of using it after cooking up the brains, tongue, and intestinal walls. I laughed and said it was a Peruvian thing and not to worry about. \n\n...And so concluded my awkward entrance into the world of Mexican dining in Arizona!","it's fast and greasy, and i eat here once in a blue moon when i'm up way too early on a weekend for home-improvement, on my way to lowes or the depot. \n\nquick and cheap, and the simple egg and cheese breakfast burrito keeps me full for about 3 days (but i never poo in those 3 days either, so it's probably not that healthy ).","Pretty decent fast Mexican food.  Like a Filaberto's, but a bit better in my book.  The place was clean, the service was nice, and the food was fresh!\n\nBut, for those who are gluten intolerant, I think the corn tortillas might have wheat in them.","uhm super burrito whatever you put in your Arizona Quesadilla minus the pico makes that quesadilla so freakin' greasy and good that i used to be enamored by Los Betos Carnitas and Carne Asada quesadillas. I'm sorry Los Betos I still heart you but Super Burrito just got my \"I love your quesadillas\" vote! So yum, cheap, and good!","I use to be a Los Betos girl, but I have converted over to Super Burrito lol. I still like them, but I find that Super Burrito has more choices and they have things available 24/7. Los Betos no longer has some of their breakfast items available past a certain time as they once did. And they don't let one do some changes to some of their orders the way they do at Super Burrito. And their churros are yummy along with their tongue tacos. I really dig their Arizona quesadilla. For some reason, I find it better as a quesadilla than as a burrito. It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food.","I love this place.  It's an inconspicuous little spot I found about 2 months ago while craving a burrito.  I gave it a shot and have been hooked ever since.  Egg, Potato & Cheese Burrito is everything!  It's even good WITHOUT the salsa choices that are available to add to your burrito.  Yes!","I am surprised by the reviews on Yelp. I would say I am almost a regular at Super Burrito. I am a self employed entrepreneur and love that it is open 24 hours dine in and drive thru. \n\nI have been going there for years and everything I have had is delicious. They are always friendly and nice and usually give me a little extra or something on the side so I can try something new. The prices can't be beat, my girlfriend and I eat for under $10 and always have some left over. The food is not bland like a lot of people say and most of all it is quality.\n\nThe salsa's are amazing with just the right amount of spice. I have even taking my family and 75 year old grandma there and she loved it!\n\nIt is true Mexican food and know that before you go in there. It is greasy depending on what you get, but so it so many other restaurants. It is family and friend owned and they consistently keep updating and improving over time!\n\nPlus they have freaking churros that are delicious!","Other than those of the \"-erto's\" name, I haven't had much luck finding good late night burritos in Scottsdale. \n\nSure, during the day there is Chipotle, or even Taco del Mar is pretty good, but the missing ingredient to my recipe for constant access to quality Mexican munchies has been the late night burrito shop. \n\nI tried this place last night, hoping it would close the deal, and, for a minute, I thought it had. An abundance of sour cream and melted cheese goes a long way in my book. I had all but decided when I got to the chicken inside my Texas burrito (containing sour cream, cheese, french fries, chicken, sour cream, cheese, and sour cream) I was thoroughly disappointed. It was grisly. A steak can have a knot or two in it, but chicken? This was no knot. These were chicken grisles. First it was one, then another, then another. \n\nThe burrito was good size and cheap and was so close to perfection if it weren't for the main ingredients' shabbiness. I may give it one more go 'round with a steak burrito, but my recommendation is to avoid the chicken.","My friend and I we're hungry and driving around. We came upon this place. The service was great and the food was filling and very delicious. It's an out of the way trip, but we will be back!","I pass by Super Burrito everyday on my way to work.  One morning, my stomach was a-grumblin' and a-growlin' and so I decided to stop and check this place out.  I decided that if I'm gonna see this bitch on a daily basis, I should at least introduce myself.\n\nInside was pretty okay.  The interior reminded me of Fat Burger, right down to the jukebox and the angry-looking Mexican dude behind the counter. As soon as I walked in, I remember being deafened with Banda music.  It was playing about as loud as it could have been played, about as loud as those cars with the bass cranked up so high that it sounds like it's farting down the street.\n\nI got my old, classic favorite while I was there:  The California Burrito.  Carne asada, potatoes, chilies and cheese.  They browned the tortilla just right so it was slightly crispy, but not crumbly and not dry.  The tortilla was big and thick too, which led me to believe that they probably made it there.  \n\nIf Super Burrito were a girl, she'd think I was pervy the way I ogled that burrito.\n\nIt was really good.  I think I'll pop in more often and wolf down some burritos.  Bonus is that it's open 24 hours, so if you have the beer munchies or the pot munchies or the regular, I haven't eaten in a while munchies and it's 2 am, you can grab a burrito and gain repletion.","I didn't love my food at Super Burrito, but to be fair, I must tell you that 3 trailer-park, hillbilly, in-bred, DOUCHEBAGS, interrupted my famous \"Taco Inspection!\" \n\nWe arrived at Super Burrito at about 2AM on a Friday night (first mistake) and immediately upon entering the restaurant and identifying myself as \"The Taco Inspector,\" these three ass-clowns got in our face and would NOT stop talking crap--even after we got our food and sat down. \n\nThe date ended with the Scottsdale Police showing up, and well, at least we got a couple minutes of these cock-noses on video with my flip camera! \n\nYou can see the video at www.thetacoreview.com \n\nFrom what I remember, my tacos were kind of bland, but we will return for a repeat-inspection.\n\nPeace from The Taco Inspector!","I really don't see how you can give this place anything other than a 4-star rating. Subtract out the fact that you're in Scottsdale and it's more likely than not that there will be one or more douchebags inside (i believe it's called a murder of douches when they travel in a pack) as well as some of the ironic hyperbole of the name, and the place is pretty damn good.\n\nI've had the carne asada (sober) and the california burrito (somewhat less than sober) and I have to say both were sold efforts. In fact, I have yet to find a clearly superior burrito in Phoenix (caveat: I am not a fan of the southwestern style carne asada that is very dry & heavily chipotle flavored). The burritos here are more Americanized mexican style and a little sloppy at times. But it's all flavor juice as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo can I recommend this place? yes. Will I go back? Yes. Am I expecting a transcendent burrito eating experience in some little-known hole-in-the-wall gem? Nope, and I'll be sure to use the drive thru next time to avoid the murder of douches inside.","I was surprised to see that other Yelpers thought this place was cheap.  Five dollars ($5.00) for a bean burrito is not reasonable, in my opinion.  To be fair, the burrito was pretty large, but I did not like that there was one price regardless of the ingredients.\n\nThe real reason that I am even writing a review is because of the poor service.  As soon as I walked in, this large and gruff man said, \"Whaddya want?\"  And after I ordered, there was of course no \"Thank You,\" no eye contact, no smile.\n\nPoor service is my pet peeve, no matter where it is found.  It just irks me.","Good cheap mexican food...that's it.  Don't come expecting more than that.  I like it during the day though because, again, it's cheap, good and the portions are pretty hefty.","I can now say I've waited 25 minutes in a drive thru line... The food was decent, definitely made fresh as it was hot when I got it... but the fact that there was a small child running around the kitchen was a bit unnerving. Overall not worth the wait...","I love super burrito, my fav is a bean tostado with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions with a little cheese, it fills you up and on weight watchers its only 6points, try it with the homemade salsa bar","Save your money. The food is bland. The pollo and carne asada are tough and full of gristle. I've given it many chances and each time they get my order wrong. Bland, bland, bland.","Not only did these assholes give me carne asada burritos when i ordered pollo, they looked guilty while I was ordering it so instead of just telling me they were out of chicken they gave me beef which I havent eaten in over 10 years thinking I would fall for it.  I will never give them my business again. Think before you act assholes.","The food is what you would expect from a little burrito shop with a drive through.  Filling, somewhat greasy and cheap!  One warning and what made me stop going here was when my boyfriend handed them his debit card to pay and they handed him a slip of paper and said, write your pin number down please.\n\nno thanks, I took my business to Fiesta Burrito.","I always like to say super burrito is super at 3 am but not so super the next morning.  Jokes aside... It's great for that past midnight bite to eat, but with places on 68th street like tacos Jalisco or the amp market open they fall way short.  They do give you good value and solve hunger issues but they are kind of like the last option for Mexican in south Scottsdale.","More soggy Rolled Tacos - five of them for $4 bucks. Slightly crispy on edges, but a mushy mess in the middle. This was through the drive-through at about 11pm. These were not good, but they are the kind of item you eat anyway if not good and regret it later. Will probably order a Burro here next time, since thats the name of the place, but they should know how to properly deep fry a rolled taco. Decent red sauce is available also.","This is one of our go to places for Mexican food.  The food is pretty fast, and always tasty.  We have had the Carnitas plates and thought that was the best it would get.  But tonight we tried the Abodabo plate, and hands down, it is a new favorite.\nWatch out for the green salsa, it sneaks up on you.  Tasty, but HOT.","Try their chile relleno, they are super!  We usually try to swing by here when we have a reason to be in Scottsdale.","I just ate a breakfast burrito with chorizo,  steak cheese and eggs that was the size of a Pringles can. Also, it was only $4. Beat that."],"business_id":"f_2iPdAHrcKMwMFJSRdFZQ","name":"Super Burrito","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["A friend and I used a groupon today for a spur of the moment dinner.  We were very pleased with the choices on the menu.  I had the seafood platter.  My friend enjoyed a green chile burrito, enchilada style.  Excellent choices.  We had too much food after enjoying the $5 happy hour margaritas and the excellent chips and salsa.  That's ok...I love to have the leftovers for lunch the next day.  \nHats off to Aaron the manager.  He took great care to give us a great experience along with our meal.","Outstanding food and sublime service! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix and Aaron the manager personally engages each patron to ensure a beyond the wow customer experience. \n\nDon't let locale fool you, it is definitely a must for food lovers.  We now have a new favorite which we will enjoy for years to come!m","Rita's offers some great menu choices. Menudo is not one of them. \nBut seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem.\nOh, they don't serve Coke products either. \n\nBeing a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe. \nThe broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird.\nThe tripe is overcooked and flubbery. \nOverall, it's pretty disgusting.\n\nSo if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it. \nInstead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito. \nTry their chips and salsa too.\n\nFour stars for the server's gigantic hangers. \nOverall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls.","My hubby works out on the west side so he will occasionally drag the whole family to some resturaunt he has decided is well worth the trek. Rita's is one of our go to's for completely authentic Mexican.  Rita herself is a classy business saavy gal from south of the border who knows her stuff and is a sweetheart to her patrons.  The food is muy muy bien.  Si es possible, triega una persona que habla espanol.   Or you can just point to the number on the menu.  Up to you.","Such a great meal! We bought a groupon and went on the same day. Being the foodies we are, we bought the Groupon for $50 worth of food and ordered up a ton of it. For apps, we had the guacamole and seafood cocktail (be warned, there was raw shrimp and scallops, mixed in with the cooked seafood) for $18.50. It had a lot of seafood: shrimp, scallops, and octopus. They did not skimp on the tableside  guacamole either. So good. \n\nFor dinner, I had the bacon wrapped shrimp with rice and salad on the side. I didn't eat the salad, but the shrimp and rice were delicious. My husband got a mixed grill plate he thoroughly enjoyed. Total bill for two dinners, soda, and apps, was $55 and we had a substantial amount of leftovers. \n\nService was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back!","The food & service was good. We had Aaron  he was awesome :) I recommend you try the toritos","So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what.  I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck in between two choices:  Rita's and another unnamed Phoenix establishment that we had already been to that is always solid never great.  Well, what the hell, let's give Rita's a shot.\n\nNice and conveniently located on 35th and the I-10, we find a spot and get in.  Order a few margaritas and they were great.  I'm not the world's biggest fan of the marg but Aaron knows how to hook it up.  Next, we ordered the table side Guac, I got the Playa Bonita, the lady got the Seafood enchiladas.  Everything was OUTSTANDING.  I tried her enchiladas and they were dynamite and I had about 4 different kinds of fish that were all cooked perfectly.\n\nService was outstanding, food was fantastic, there was absolutely no reason this place wasn't jam packed on a Saturday night.  I suggest you go support a local business that does things right.  I love Pappadeaux as much as the next guy and can say that Rita's stands just as tall next to them in service and food quality.   You won't get the white tablecloth but you will have an extra $50 in your pocket when you leave and be just as satisfied.","Update: the owner did write to me saying they will work on getting their takeout orders correct. I appreciate a business willing to improve.","The food at Rita's is fantastic, the prices are very reasonable, the interior is handsomely designed, and the people who work there are always friendly.  My overall impression is that there is a deep commitment to excellence from the kitchen to the table. The shrimp wrapped in bacon is awesome! I drive in to Phoenix from out of town, have been there more than once, have brought guests, and look forward to the next time I visit.","Groupon took us to this restaurant today, we arrived at about 3pm and the restaurant was slow.  Aaron was our waiter and led us to wonderful selections on the menu.  We would rate Rita's salsa pretty close to the best salsa we have ever had!  Aaron was also our bartender and he mixed us up two fabulous margaritas.  We had Parrillada del Rancho for Two for lunch/dinner - the price was very reasonable for the amount of food that was delivered!  The platter had freshly seasoned carne asada, grilled chicken breast and pork chop accompanied by grilled vegetables, served with rice, beans, pico and fresh tortilla's.  No way could we eat it all and we definitely left with full tummy's and a nice to go box!  Plus, we felt this was possibly the best Mexican food we have had in the eight years we have been visiting various Mexican food establishments here in Phoenix.  Bravo Rita's!!  We will be back and we will recommend you to our friends and family.","My wife and I had the owner (I believe) and he was very warm and made us feel welcome.  He recommeded the stuffed peppers with shrimp , wrapped in bacon and it was delicious!  He was genuinely excited about his food/service and it shows.   I doubt I will be back because of the very long distance from my house but I'd love for him to have a restaurant in California!  I would highly recommend!","My first time at Rita was memorable.  From the food to the service everything was top notch. Aaron who is the bartender/manager/host is friendly and funny. The toritos are an amazing appetizer.  Aaron even offered to buy them for us if we did not like them. They are yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and then wrapped in bacon. My main course was the carne asada with a cheese enchilada. The meal came with rice, beans and a salad. My father had the shredded beef chimichunga. The rice and beans were not included with the chimichunga.  The rice is fluffy and flavorful.  The beef in the chimichunga was sweet but had great flavor. The service was very fast. Drinks were refilled very fast. Aaron is a great host and makes you feel like family.  We will be going back and will tell our friends about this amazing place.","First time here. I have passed this restaurant for years now and I have never ate here. I decides to try it last year after buying a groupon. My groupon expires today just in time before my brothers birthday. Now I have to say it is a nice little cozy place nestled on a corner close to the freeway. Parking is limited. There is a line of spaces in the back of building maybe holds a good to 12 cars against a 3 ft brick wall right by the alley. Don't let the location chase you away.  The building itself is cute lined with arched beautiful windows. When you walk in you can seat yourself someone will come to you and take your order.  The inside is nicely decorated with typical Mexican decor Pancho Villa pictures and all. Not overly done but tastefully done. You will be served fresh hot chips with mmm mmm salsa. I bit spicy maybe for the weak but still full of flavor. We had an excellent waitress and she made sure our basket and salsa was always full along with our drinks. Water is not tap lol so that was nice I was a bit thirsty so didn't mind the refills. We ordered the platter with seafood for 2 you get a salad Mexican potatoes and rice. The platter was abundant with several tasty items sea bass grilled and breaded. Shrimp grilled AND lightly breaded and bacon wrapped and to top off a lobster tail. It truly was alot we definitely could not finish. If you ever are in the area and would like some authentic Mexican dishes stop by Rita's.  The menu will not disappoint anyone there is something for everyone.","Classic Tex-Mex style for This part of the country. Well maintained and clean restaurant. Home made style Enchilada and Chile Rellenó combo was not over done with cheese. Didn't get any tortillas as part of my meal but I could have easily asked for some. The bar is small but they do a variety of margarita's that satisfy!","At first I was a little concerned about the location. But the restaurant was very clean both in & out, had a fun atmosphere & was a gem of a find through Groupon \n\nThe table side guac is super delicious.  And Aaron makes a helluva margarita. The service was outstanding & extremely personable at all levels.","Traveling cross country we were in search of a Mexican restaurant close to highway 10. Rita's popped up. Salsa was fresh and spicy. The chips were crisp. The carne asada and fish enchiladas were perfect. Our server Yuriria  was quick and extremely pleasant.","Really good.  It was sold to new ownership, and the tradition lives, with even better food.  Try the Rellenos.  Theirs are goos.","I don't understand the great reviews! Aaron was a friendly guy, but only felt a slight buzz after two margaritas! Normally, I can't finish two! Ordered the toritos appetizer and the shrimp were very small and not very flavorful! The pepper was HOT! And it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce! Chips and salsa were ok, salsa was a little fiery. I ordered Chili Colorado, which on the menu came with a choice of red or green sauce. I ordered it with green sauce but Aaron said it came with red sauce. \"It's chili colorado which is red sauce.\" I asked him why it says with red or green sauce on the menu. I love chili verde but never had it with beef. I stuck with the red sauce. The sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough. The dish was quite salty and I happen to love salt, but it wasn't a good salty. The beans literally tasted like LARD! The rice was ok. My friend ordered carnitas which was supposed to be slow slimmered in sauce. Wish I would have taken a picture of it - pieces of burnt pork with no sauce whatsoever! He normally likes burnt meat, but the only edible pieces were the ones with fat! I give this place a two because the other two people in my party liked their food. I get better Mexican food back home in Las Vegas. For some reason we thought we'd be getting awesome Mexican food in Phoenix!","There is too much to say but I am so full I have to take a nap this place was great service cute sweet waitresses food was plentiful servings are large u get more than what u pay for on quality and quantity I'm a truck driver so I see a lot of restaurants and I have had 1 other restaurant that was this good and it was on the border of Texas and I could walk behind the restaurant and be in Mexico and this has to be my number 2 spot. My final words are DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP TRY IT EAT AND U WILL LOVE IT","I come in from Orange County every 5-6 weeks on business and stay for a few days. I make sure to eat here every time I come into town. Food is awesome and staff is very friendly. Love the carnitas plate!","Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! WE picked up a Groupon and decided to check this place out. I'm all for a new Mexican restaurant and Rita's did NOT disappoint! It's right off the I-10 at 35th ave, super easy to get to. We started with the table side Guacamole, which was perfect! two HUGE avocados and super fresh chips. The house salsa was also perfect! The next dish we got was the seafood cocktail de molcatejes (sp?) Talk about a humongoid bowl of awesomeness! (See the pic I posted). it was full of shrimp, octopus, scallops and fresh veggies ($20). I went with this mixed grill Plate, that had pork, beef and chicken with griled veggies and peppers! Thsi thing came out still sizzling on a huge platter! Talk about wow factor! Tehy have a seafood version for a few bucks more, definitely a killer dish. All in all, the food  was fantastic, the service was awesome and we'll for sure be back!","I love the food here and frequent Rita's for lunch. Eight of us went to happy hour and much to my surprise completely different from lunch. with 2 tables occupied we sat down and waited for our server. she came over after about 20 minutes, we ordered drinks and then we waited for an hour, we then asked where our drinks were and we found out that no one on staff was old enough to serve alcohol. just a kid and what looked like her boy friend were so called working. Terrible experience and i will never go back for dinner/happy hour. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, I was shocked with the terrible experience. The management must change their evening operations.","Yum, I definitely recommend the Taritos, which at this place are green peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon - amazing. The carne asada was nice as well, but the service is a bit slow. Very authentic.","Right when we walked in the door we were greeted and seated with a smile. Luckily for us we came in during happy hour. The $3 beers and $5 margaritas were huge and delicious. The food was wonderful and reasonably priced. After our meal the manager came over and asked us how everything was. Talk about service! We will definitely come back!","Great Mexican food and excellent service! The food and the Margaritas are to die for! Try it, it is worth it.\nEver, Erin and Paulina always make you feel welcome.","Very good Mexican food. The server was friendly but seemed overworked. The chips and salsa was excellent. I ordered the machaca chimi and it was very good. Did not come with rice and beans but was enough food itself. I would recommend this to people who want more than chain Mexican food.","Been going here since the 80's always good.. this place has always been a treat.!\nOne thing that hasn't changed \"thank god\" is the salsa","Second time to Rita's.  The best Mexican food in the valley.  Great mix of real Mexican style recipes (the seafood) sonoran/southwest style favorites, and even fajitas (which I haven't had yet but given lack of good fajitas in az I bet these will be great.   The Chile rellenos I had today was the best I have ever had.","Best red and green chili burros in town! Friendly service and authentic \nfood. Check it out!\n\nalso, to get a 2 dollar plate of fried ice cream with flan and a deep fried shell is awesome, can't think of a better desert for the cost in the valley!","Grabbed lunch there today - not near my normal stomping ground but it looked like a decent place so I took a chance.  Inside, clean and bright and a mix of biz people at lunch, local workers, some families.  Server was prompt, nice and spoke English fluently.  They brought out chips & salsa and the salsa was fantastic... fresh, home-made and had a nice kick.\n\nI chose a $6.95 combo plate - taco, bean tostada and enchilada.  5 minutes after ordering it was served up.  What immediately stood out was everything was simple and light.  The taco wasn't greasy - just some tasty meat, lettuce and white cheese.  The tostada was similar - just a simple base with some really nice refried beans (def not from a can) and crispy lettuce/tomato and white cheese.  The enchilada was good as well.  I prefer  New Mexico style enchiladas, with a really hot sauce, so i rarely order them outside of NM because they are usually bland.  This had a red sauce that wasn't hot, but was definitely homemade and flavorful. \n\nOverall it was pretty straightforward, simple, yet flavorful fare and seemed a lot less heavy/greasy than typical places.  And I'm often fine with greasy, though the beltline would disagree.  I'd defintely frequent the place if it was near, though it's not so special to merit an out-of-the-way trip.  It's a place where they care about making good grub and that shows.  If you're near or going to be in the area, it's worth exploring.","Stopped n sat. afternoon - what a mistake this place was!!  It had to b the slowest most unfriendly  place I have ever bn too n a very long time....  Asked  our server , Betsy 4 more salsa and it literally took 17min. b4 she came back w/it . The other genius that was serving also looked @ us 3 times and said b rite w/u, NEVER came back !! They each had 2 tables and u wuld have thought they had a line out the door- they were both overwhelmed beyond my comprehension, never cn anything like it b4!!  I took one bite of my DRY chicken ench. & spit it out n a napkin, NEVER did she ask was their a problem w/ur food ....  I have bn a  bartender 14yrs. and in the food industry for 28yrs. , it's bn 3.5hrs since we were n there and i'm still baffled on this horrible, rude service .... Don't know how they keep there jobs w/their poor attitudes....  NEWS FLASH -  Ur customers pay ur bills !!!!  I DID NOT want to leave her a tip but decided i wuld leave a dollar so mayb she wuld think twice and smile @ the next table, she didn't !!!!  I wuld have left a 50% tip had my experience bn different....  You NEVER know what ur customer does for a living so watch how u treat people....  NEVER GOING BACK !!!!","Best Mexican food I have found in years. Salsa and chips are excellent. I go at least once a week. Great carnitas, carne asada.","A friend of mine and her husband and 2 kids went to this restaurant for the first time ever and just LOVED it!  My friend picked a bit from everybody's plate and has this to say:\nChicken tacos - fantastic!\nChicken and rice soup - tasted as good as homemade soup!!!!!\nRice - not too fluffy nor clumpy\nBeans - very good (and my friend does NOT like beans)\nEverything was covered with delicious white grated cheese.\nNote:  very little to no English is spoken at this establishment.","This place is the best thing going on in this area.  \n\nIn a neighborhood known more for warehouses than restaurants I was pleasantly surprised by how good Rita's is.  Great salsa - and definitely above average food!  Great rice, tasty beans, and the shrimp flautas were awesome!   \n\nI've also had the huevos and chorizo there which were spot on delicious!  Friendly staff and clean dining area.","Outstanding fajitas!!! Probably best I've ever had! Homemade tortillas are delicious. This place packs them in!  It's very popular. Friendly good service too.","Went here because it was recommended by 2 co-workers and we also had a Groupon. We will be back, the food was amazing, the service was excellent, not very busy and service was fast. We will be going back, prices were reasonable even if we didn't have the Groupon.","You love a good green chile dish, especially Hatch chiles. \nYou also have no particular regard for your bumhole, evidenced by your routine attempts to set it ablaze the next day with your pepper infused crap. \nWell have I got good news for you. \nRita's Mexican Food.\n\nRita's offers one of the finest green chile dishes I've ever experienced, transcending most Mexican food joints by miles.\nOn my last visit, I tried bowl of green chile stew. It was hot. \nNo, wait, let me rephrase that...\n\n       It was FUCKING HOT.\n\nIt was so hot, it sent me into a sneezing session the scientists at Claritin would have marveled at. \nThen I started crying. \nLike a little bitch and, I got all snotted-up too. \nBut god, was it ever good. The service...not so much. \n\nIn fact, the service wasn't anything to write home about. Not that you would anyway, even if it was good. Making me wonder why people invoke that stupid cliche anyway?\nI doubt seriously I'd ever leave a restaurant, go home, whip out my laptop and write my folks about how wonderful my lunch service was. \nBut if I did, this is how it would go:\n\nDear Mom and Dad.\n\nThe place where I ate lunch today had such good service, I thought I had better write to tell you about it. Because that's what people do right? They get good service and write home. Unlike when you get bad service, and simply fail to write about it. This is why I'm writing home.\nI got good service and just thought you both should know all about it. But this seems like service hypocrisy in a sense, which is why I'll probably start writing you when I get bad service as well, despite its lack of anything to write home about. \nAnyways, that's it for now. \nExpect more emails. I eat out often. \n\nYour loving son, \nDiego","Posole is authentic and delicious. Margaritas by aaron are fantastic. Bacon wrapped peppers with shrimp are to die for. This place is worth driving to no matter the distance.","Ritas never fails to deliver a great Mexican meal at good prices.  Tried the chicken chimy really good as is all the other items I have had. Aaron is gr a at server bar tr nder","Having lived in Texas for 20 years, and AZ for 10, I have eaten in a lot of Mexican Food Restaurants. My wife and I went to Rita's tonight and I can honestly say that this is the best Mexican Food place I have eaten in in a very very long time.\n\nThe Food was excellent (Rocky Point style), the Service was really really good. The salsa is to die for. I ate more chips and salsa than I should have, but it was so so good. I learned that the woman who makes this salsa, has not shared the recipe with ANYONE. It is that good.\n\nFirst things first, we were greeted with what I thought was your basic typical red salsa and chips. Wrong! The chips were typical but the red salsa was definitely not! Things were great so far. But things got a lot better.\n\nThen we had the Toritos Appetizer: Yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon with a really tasty sauce. Oh my, what amazing taste!\n\nMy wife had a beautiful dish named Parrillada del Rancho. The food tasted great, but it came in a Tericotta serving dish. I have never ever seen anything like it before. It added something to the meal that is beyond belief.\n\nI usually come to a mexican restaurant with my pre-conceived notion of what I like. Well I like what I like, and have for a long time. But tonight I decided to get something a little different - I got the Camarones cobijados (Shrimp in a Blanket). Strimp stuffed with crab meat and wrapped in bacon. Yes, as Emeril says pork fat rules. I love bacon. This was really a good call on my part. It was great.\n\nOur waitress was very helpful, she was prompt, she refilled my water glass several times without my asking. Just a great evening. And the best part? I only live about 20 minutes away, and I didn't even know this place existed. Well I do NOW.\n\nAll in all, I would give this place 6 stars out of 5.\n\nWe will definitely be back.","First visit ever, due to a Groupon deal. Was not disappointed. Great food, love the ambiance, great service by the waitresses. They checked back often, and if I wanted more chips and salsa. I had shrimp ceviche, seven seas soup, and heuvos con chorizo. It was all delicious! \n\nPrices were reasonable and serving sizes generous.  Wooden booths, wooden tables and chairs, Spanish music, quick service, sufficient parking. Coming off the I-10, you have to go north then find a turn around point. The atmosphere was nice. Some old objects on walls for ambiance. Plenty of seating. No wait on Saturday. It looks deceiving on the outside, I wasn't sure they were open, but I was there around 6pm. \n\nI'll be returning for sure. Thanks for a great first experience everyone there!","Great value for a sit down place. Food was good. Getting into the parking lot was a little tight, but manageable.","As their sign says: Autentica Comida Mexicana. The food, the vibe, the service - all excellent. My friend and fellow yelper John M. and I had quite a feast here. Acting on advice from the reviews I read here, I ordered the seafood enchilada - it was pure ambrosia, loaded with juicy shrimp and fish cooked just right. John had the garlic shrimp and let me try some of it; the shrimp was succulent and the garlic flavor intense - I loved it! Caveat: I'm a very big fan of garlic and am one of those people who believe that you can never have too much garlic in a dish, so some of you might find the flavor on the aggressive side if you order it. But I know it's what I'll be ordering next time ;)   The generous and tasty house margaritas were a perfect complement to the delightful repast..","Check your takeout order b/f you leave the parking lot.

{"reviews":["I went during the Iowa Football Homecoming game against Penn St. and the place was loaded with Iowa fans, in their hawk gear, into the game, and cheering on the team. I had $2 Bud Light bottles and $5 for a dozen wings and $5 plate of nachos. It's a hip place, spacious, and good atmosphere. I had a fun time for a good price.\n\nI probably enjoyed this place a little more than your average guy, since I'm a University of Iowa alum, and this is an official Hawkeye bar.","I've lived here for two weeks and have happily been to this bar three times.  Every time, awesome!  Rad bartenders that make tasty margaritas, delish guacamole, and I always find great clientele to mingle with.  HOWEVER...My bedroom faces this bar.  Is it absolutely necessary to be dumping glass bottles AFTER 2am most nights?  I think, as a good neighbor, since there are apartments behind you, I would hold off on this. 'Cause hell,  It's LOUD.  Is someone breaking into my apartment?, LOUD.  Love ya anyhoo.  Just sayin'.","Sandbar is like a slightly more affordable, less dressed-up Devil's North. They literally have sand on the outside patio, so in the warm months you can rock sandals and feel the [artificial] sand between your toes as you sip your beer. Not too shabby.\n\nIn general, I have been pretty happy with the crowds at this location, as well. The less dressed up vibe blurs the lines of who has how much money and even the music is more accessible. \n\nOf the North Scottsdale scene, Sandbar is my standout favorite . . . if I have a ride. I have found myself on more than a couple of occassions stranded at three in the morning in search of a taxi cab on Scottsdale road.","I mean no cover and its not bad...however..be aware that there is ACTUAL sand there...i had a little too much to drink and apparently didn't notice..however when I saw my shoes the other day...they looked like somebody blew a huge load of angel dust everywhere","They're getting better at separating bills and not having mysterious drinks appear on your own tab.\n\nif Jasmine didn't work there, i'd have no reason to go to this location anymore.\n\ni was told to stop giving hot chicks piggy back rides. seriously?\n\nno redbull? wtf!?!?!","This place is kind of like a train wreck.  One between a train full of Jersey Shore castoffs and a train full of Paris Hilton wannabes.  Just stay away.","The good news is that they have Negra Modelo at 2 for $2.50 at Happy Hour, which has to be some kind of Scottsdale record.\n\nThe bad news is that it's a Mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  Big humongous ones.  Not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. Friendly servers though.\n\nThe food - at least what I had - was barely edible.  Stick to the $1.25 beers.","20 TVs and a full on guacamole spread.\n\nIf you're here for spring training and need a break from socializing at the mall (I kid you not, they party at Fashion Square Mall here), come to a place where you can dip your toes in groddy kiddie pool water.\n\nIf you're lucky you'll get the waitress with Asian guy fetish so its well worth the $180 that United charges you","Sand in a bar in the AZ? While I thought this was too good to be true when the north Scottsdale bar first opened a few years back, I soon found out it wasn't and Sandbar has become one of my favorite Scottsdale bars. \n\nThe beach bar features a sand-covered patio, private patio cabanas, an ample margarita menu, delicious Mexican eats and a small pool. The restaurant and bar is decorated with bright decor and the dance floor is a hot spot on the weekends.\n\nNow if only they would add an ocean!","In the scheme of things, Sandbar is a great alternative to the Scottsdale scene.  It is a little less dressy and a little more casual.  The food is good for what is worth -- Mexican bar food.  But, I love going there because the crowd is a bit more chill and its a little more relaxing than the other places in the area.  There are a lot of TV's, which is nice to catch a sports game.  There are private patio cabanas, but I have never used them.  This is a great place to hang outside in the sandy patio for happy hour or to get your groove on the dance floor during the weekend nights.","One star because this place, during summer and during happy hour, could be tolerable for a very short time, other than that ----- Run Away!!!\n\nThe have the worst music mix on a Friday night.  It's ghetto-fabulous rap and crappy Bon Jovi (the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to Living on a Prayer I swear).  \n\n$9 mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better, I feel like such a winner paying 3 x regular price of a regular drink.  $ 4 Coronas.\n\nI saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy, nice. \n\nOne out of two had fake breasts.   Seriously, I counted.\n\nI entertained myself by watching the ladies in 3-4\" heels sink into the sand, and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink. Classy.\n\nWhat Scottsdale stereotype's? ----------Yeah right.","I cannot fathom why somebody +21 would go here other than the cruel initiation of a Community College Rugby hazing or you are someone who thinks some chick from Mountain View will check out your onions if you buy her a couple of screwdrivers.","All I'm gonna say is that I HATE THE SANDBAR.  I really do, probably  for personal reasons:  I am always dragged there by the dumbest, most immature people I know and sand sucks unless you are actually at the beach.  If you must go, fine, but just don't ask me to go with you. \n\nI'm glad I got that off my chest.  \n\nIn their defense, I have never had their food.  So, that could be great and I could be missing out... but, I doubt it.","Ugh I can't stand this place. The only reason it gets two stars is because I can walk there and it's an okay place to day drink and eat some chips and salsa.  On Cinco de Mayo, they block of the parking lot and fill it with sand and then you have to wait 30 minutes to get in.  And then pay.  \n\nFriday and Saturday nights are lame-o.  Guys have to pay $5.00.  If you're in heels, forget walking in the sand.  The dance floor fills with a bunch of drunks around midnight.  The crowd is definitely not \"Scottsdale\", but it's something.....more like skater boy meets Affliction meets arm band tattoos.  And that's just the guys.  \n\nI've just spend a few too many nights here either with friends that actually like it or as a last resort so we can stumble home....and haven't had a good time, EVER.","Ladies and Drag Queens beware, the \"sandbar\" actually has sand outside. Not very friendly to those trying to impress in heels. I work very close to the Sandbar on friday nights after work alot (10-15) of people from my work go there. I have been there quite a few times but not somewhere I would encourage someone to go. I have had some of the food, minichimis are ok, tasty when you are drunk but it's no substitute for Jack in The Box tacos at 2 in the morning. \nThere are a lot of great options for happy hour this just ins't one of them.","My favorite place in the valley!  Mostly because it is next door to where I live but have ALWAYS had a good time here.  Some people in the Scottsdale/Chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the \"Scottsdale\" crowd, much more laid back. You don't have to dress up in heels to go either, flip flops are fine on Friday and Saturday nights.  But if you are in heels, beware of actual sand outside. Bartenders are always friendly, just a good place to chill with friends.  Also, the Baja fish tacos are awesome here!  The nachos are ok too.  They also show UFC fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends.","Great place to watch an Iowa game if you are in the Phoenix area and the atmosphere is a huge reason.  The uber hot waitstaff is another.  U of Iowa fans get drunk and rowdy.  Since game times are at 9, people arrive early and get breakfast.  Lots of HDTVs, all tuned to the Iowa game.  There is a huge and loyal Iowa following in the Scottsdale area, so seats fill up quick.  Drinks are pricy, but the hotness of the waitresses tend to distract from the bill.  It is HIGHLY recommended to attend the Iowa vs Iowa State football games at the Sandbar.  It is INSANITY. \n\n\nLooking for more Iowa Natives to review this bar, though.","What shoes should I wear? Seriously I am going out so I can't wear sneakers or sandals but I don't want sand on my nice shoes. What to do.\n\nFirst off I have never eaten the food here. I usually come to hang out with friends and have drinks.  \n\nFirst who has a outdoor patio in AZ with out mist and big fans?\n\nThe beers and other drinks are a bit pricey.\n\nAfter 10 there is a cash only cover charge so they can evade paying tax on it.\n\nIn general nothing great at all.","love this bar!  did you know they were building one up at desert ridge??? just drove by today and saw the sign and a building being worked on...AMAZING so fun and a great spot for it.  :)  Food is fun, service is good...great spot to watch games and they usually have some good drink specials so you're not about to break the bank when going there.","Only eaten here once or twice and it was so-so.\n\nI really come here for the dancing and drinking!  I've never had a bad time here.  There's definitely something for everyone here.  You can sit in a booth or at the bar inside OR you can go outside.  They have it like a beachy bar.  There's a bar, cabanas and tables/chairs in the sand!  They also have a little water pool area thing that you can walk in and get your feet wet.  There are always interesting and fun people here and it's a great place to meet someone new.  I like to take my out of town friends here.  It's so different!","This place is very fun, I only been here a few times, but already love it!","The place is an absolute trainwreck. And here's why: The night started with a 35 minute wait in line, while tight shirted MMA wannabes paid the \"VIP\" doorman to let them and their 30 closest friends in before us. We were in line so long that people in front of us bailed and it seemed like every person leaving was yelling to those of us in line about how horrid the scene was inside.\nBut we decided to stay because we had always enjoyed the one in north Scottsdale. Bad idea. \nOnce we finally got up to the doorman, he gave us the \"whatever\" distant stare and held his hand up in a \"I'm holding an ID\" move. No hello, or welcome to sandbar. Then they charged us $5, which would be fine if the girl collecting the cash wasn't also cold and unattentive. \nBut whatever, we're in let's have some fun! Wrong. \nThe bar was busy but not packed, making us pretty angry that we were in line so long. But still we couldn't get a drink. We flagged down 3 different bartenders (who all had the exact same huge upper bodies, tiny legs and spiky hair) until the ONE person there doing their job approached us. It was a small female bartender who was sweating and sprinting around the bar while her male counterparts sat around discussing the merits of the Jersey Shore and spray on tans. \nWe had a drink and walked around. The ambience is dull and unimpressive, the bouncers were all busy talking to girls, the interior has super low celings and tiny booths, the outside looks like you're at a bar in Rocky Point that was half built but opened anyways. \nThe crowd was pretty awful too. Lots of bumping with no \"excuse me\", tons of way too drunk people and very, very poor on the guy to girl ratio. \nAfter a failed attempt to get another drink, we left the bar, confident that not only will we not return to this poorly designed, awfully mismanaged bar, but we will avoid the other sandbars at all times as well. \nSorry to be a downer, I was anticipating a really fun night at a new place, and it ended up just being a complete waste of our time.","Great place to watch an Iowa Hawkeye game!  There is a HUGE Iowa following in the Phoenix area that meetup regularly at the Sandbar on Saturdays during football time.  And it gets crazy!  They turn all of the TVs to the Iowa game.  Everyone is drunk by lunch because the games start at 9.  \n\nDrinks are pricy, and there is a high DB count in this place, but the scenery is nice.  \n\nBe careful about parking, though.","like the \"bro\" scene? you'll love it here. i was hoping for more than the typical scottsdale meat market, but was sorely disappointed. drink service was slow, bartender poured weak cocktails, and the whole experience was below average. to top it off, it seemed as though every man in the place considered a woman's presence there a free pass to to touch her back, hip or butt as they walked past. if i don't know you, please don't touch me. the bathroom was ridiculously small and dirty. overall the sandbar was disgusting, overrated and so far, the worst meat market of them all.","Other than the sand angle, definitely just an average bar.  The drinks are okay, the service was average.  Definitely caters to a younger crowd, although the crowd was mixed the last 2 times we were there.  Have never eaten there.  The music is definitely geared to 20 sometimes, although not as bad as the techno pseudo music played at some other clubs.  Will definitely go back, not because of the club, but because of the location.","If you visit the Sandbar and you are not a Scottsdale local you will be convinced that breast implants are a requirement for working there. Every bartender/waitress seemed to have implants. To add to that, across me ther was a young girl having the following conversation with some cougar: \n\nYoung Girl: Yeah, my doctor was awesome.\nCougar: Oh yeah?\nYoung girl: yeah, he made them completely natural\nCougar: oh.....\nYoung Girl: You should totally get some...\nCougar: yeah, I've thought about...\nYoung Girl: here, let me give you his card\n\nSo in other words... if you like breast implants visit the Sandbar. As far as the food...who knows, who cares?","There is sand at the Sandbar underneath some of the tables.  It gives it a beach type of feel on the outside.  I did feel like coming from the beach because I had a precarious event happen right before.  I was at a pool party, and I was wearing casual clothes because I knew I was going to join a birthday party right after at Sandbar.  I was about to leave, and one of the girls was really drunk and said that I had to be in the pool.  Her and her friend literally double teamed me and started to take off my shoes, socks, and important articles.  I started to get a cramp, so I resisted the fight.  I got thrown in the pool with my clothes on!\n\nLuckily, it was an AZ summer night of 100 degrees and I would dry off right away.  When I entered Sandbar, I felt like I was in the right place because of what just happened.  It was a very casual atmosphere, very much many AZ bars.  Near the entrance, they had a cute girl giving out shots and beers.  Once every hour or so, they would announce some drinks specials to order from her.  Drinks in general were about standard prices.  I got some beer, so I can't comment on any mixed drinks.  There was a medium size dance floor on the inside.  I like the fact Sandbar gives a casual beach vibe, but you can still rock it out on the dance floor inside.\n\nOverall, it was a fun experience to a crazy night, and I can see myself out here again.  Hopefully this time I am not soaking wet!","I dont know...if youre just looking for a cheap Mexican inspired meal and a casual patio, its fine. I only give it 3 stars because the warm (thin but not too thin and litely salted) tortilla chips and green & red salsas were EXCELLENT!! Everything else was just ok. The quesadilla was ok, the coconut shrimp were ok, the grilled fish tacos were almost ok, the prickly pear margs were really sweet but ok. The service was ok. An excellent choice for ulyra casual watching sports or after playing sports (some of patio is actually covered in sand) - not great for a business hh with clients in high heels :-/","I tried going here to use my Groupon earlier this week but they were closed for renovation. They're changing their name too. Bummer - I wish they updated their web site that they would be closed.","The sandbar is a pretty nice bar, overall.  It's huge, with great music and good people!  I went here for my birthday and had a blast.  The location is kind of weird; it's in a shopping center.  Being from CA, I'm not used to this!  The ONE thing is, don't rub up against the wall of the dance floor...  it cut my back and I was bleeding for 4 days!  But maybe that was more alcohol induced than anything else.   I agree with  the other reviews: don't wear heels - there is actual sand here people! I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for some good dancing and atmosphere!","Happy hour sausagefest apres 6 pm weekdays. There must have been 30 guys and maybe 5 chicks on two different occasions. Whoa! I like the specials and love the Malibu accessories spread across the walls. Way to get my attention!!","I just want to start this review out by saying if you think wearing heels to the Sandbar is a good idea, you are f'ing retarded.. And yet, I see the same hoes wearing the same hoe-y heels and complaining that they cant walk and that the sand in between their toes is disgusting. God people are irritating. \n\nI don't love this place. In fact, I don't even really like this place. I feel like everyone who goes there has a giant stick up their ass, stares at you like you have 10 goddamn heads and the dudes.. don't even get me started on the dudes. Lets just say douche to the bag. But pluralized. 500 times.\n\nI once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground. Don't do this. Don't even take your shoe off ever. Also, don't get in that water. I swear a layer of syphilis was floating on the top of it last time I was there. I think a decent rake job on their pseudo beach is a must after every shift.. and perhaps some chlorine, or better yet...  bleach. Seriously, think about it.\n\nThe one cool thing that ever happened at the Sandbar in the handful of times i've been forced to come here was that a dude bought 100 beers. He bought ONE HUNDRED BEERS and passed them out to whoever was close. I think I walked away with 3, and who the hell doesn't love free beer. Other than that, this place is enormous and confusing and dirty and there are random shards of glass and STD's floating around everywhere. \n\nSorry dudes, im just, not a fan.","I know several people personal at the Peoria Sandbar and try to get over there as often as I can, with the Scottsdale location being closer to my house a group of friends and I decided to party at the Scottsdale location for New Year's Eve this year. \n\nOverall we had a great time. The theme of the evening was Paparazzi. They had a red carpet outside with a photog, disposable cameras on the table for everyone to document the evening, and crazy drink specials. I choose to partake in the Champagne Bucket special, $20 for 4 mini bottles, which I bough two of. Probably should have rethought that one, as the next day I hurt, but who didn't? \n\nThings I didn't like.... the dance floor was crazy packed, the line for the bathroom was out of control (but there isn't really any helping that, don't go pee? lol) and some of the female bartenders had a difficult time serving me, it was as if I was completely invisible to them at times. I finally caught on to this and walked to the other side of the bar and they guys took way better care of me. \n\nWe had fun, I would recommend partying here. I haven't had the food in a long time so I cannot speak on that aspect at this time.","I thought this was a decent sports bar, so I met my husband and some friends here for lunch on the Friday of the first round of the NCAA tournament. We were the only table of people inside and there were maybe 10 other people in the entire place. Including an handful of old (50+) men that hugged all of the waitresses WAY too long. They lingered.\nAnyway, our server was awful. I've been a server at different points in my life, and I have no problem calling out the ones that suck. She was worthless. No one got water more than once and the drinks sat empty for 15-20 minutes at time. \nThe food was pathetic. I'm 6.5 months pregnant and will eat just about anything you put in front of me...but I didn't want to eat any of the tacos I ordered. $12 for three TINY tacos that had zero meat on the inside and what little food there was in them tasted like crud. Also, apparently the dish comes with rice and beans...which come on their own gigantic plate. Since no one ate theirs, because it was so bad, the plates of rice and beans sat there the entire time we were there. Even after our other plates were cleared, the freaking beans and rice would not go away. She just kept leaving them there, apparently in case we got some cravings for black beans with beers, after the beans had been sitting there for half an hour.\nAfter waiting for 20 minutes or so just to see our server to get our check, we finally just went to the bar to pay. When our server returned with our cards, she apologized that she wasn't around. She said she'd told her boss that she felt like she was getting sick and thought he was going to take care of the check. Super glad this one was serving us drinks and food all afternoon, especially to a pregnant chick, if she feels like crap.\nThat was the first and last time I'll ever go there. Way too many great places in this area to get great food from servers who aren't going to give you herpes. Which is what I'm 99% sure she was coming down with.","So this is gonna be one of 'those' reviews. \nYes, Iam a hater. \n\nGranted, The Sandbar isn't a true Scottsdale club, at least to me, but what would I know, I likes the dive bars. \n\nSo, here's the story. \nI have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places. How this happens, I don't know. I guess Iam just that awesome. \n\nBeen dragged here twice, Iam not gonna count the 3rd time because that was more of a 'walked in thru the kitchens back door to get to the restrooms' type of visit. \n\nThe other 2 times I went there were not planned, but same basic experience each time. \n\nThe sandy beach out front is a hassle and I got tired of hearing those girls complaining about how difficult it is to walk thru, duh, its freakin' sand! \nIt took a while for the bartender to make the drinks, since she was the only one in the outside area. \n\n\nAs for inside, lots of MMA inspired shirts and camisoles with no bras, AKA super classy! \nI suppose I chose a bad night, since whenever a UFC fight is on, its super packed with big strong guys watching big strong guys fight on TV, so my fault there. \n\nIn the end, I was bored out of my mind, but highly entertained with the group who was doing the \"Lean Like A Cholo\" dance while sitting in a booth. \n\nSo, 1 star, and that's being generous.","This is my primary happy hour spot when I'm hanging out with friends I worked with in Scottsdale. Jasmine is my favorite waitress there. There are times I've had drinks just show up on my bill so be sure to check.","sandbar is an attractive place. i went there with a couple buddies to check out the happy hour. ive been here a couple times before but usually on a weekend and wasted and its pretty cool then.\n\nwe sat at the outside bar where the sand is. if i thought about it i wouldve brought sandals. im joking.\n\nhappy hour is good. 1/2 off apps and drinks, so roughly $2 domestic pints. \n\nwe mostly enjoyed the food we had. i got the carne asade fajitas. good stuff. \n\ncool bartender and plenty of girls to round out the atmosphere. \n\nsurprisingly i didnt get wings this time, but ill be back, and will update this review.","Wouldn't disagree with the negative reviews about this place. But bottom line, I always have a good time here. I have not tried their food.","$1 Taco Tuesday produced some mighty tasty taco's, but the place was slow and lifeless. I love the concept of the outdoor beach, pool, and surfboard tables - walking around in the sand makes you feel like you're on vacation. The inside is huge, but feels like any other Mexican restaurant with a bar. Bring your friends and try this for happy hour, or late on the weekends - when it turns into more of a club.","So disappointing.  Been there at least 10 times before with a good experience, but after tonight....we won't be back.  Ordered a chicken burrito sans onion....full of onion so my onion-allergy husband was unable to eat his entree.  Ordered nachos without sour cream....coated with sour cream beneath the cheese.  Pushed those aside.  Calimari was fine as were the drinks.  Server very pleasant.  When we pointed out the food issues she was great in apologizing, but that was it.  No re-do offered; nothing taken off the bill, lesson learned. Important to add, we were 2 of about  6 customers in the place.  Can't chalk the food up to a busy night. Adios.","So I was there a few days ago and really liked it. Food was good, the steak nachos were awesome and the burger good. I thought it was very reasonably priced though I was there during Happy hour (3-7?) so a lot was half off. Still 5 dollars a beer is about average in Scottsdale and half off is even better. The service was good and the bartender was funny and prompt with the drinks. I will definitely go back and recommend it to any of you."],"business_id":"hsOnzcy8mFbUvIWFC1agoQ","name":"Sandbar","categories":["Bars","Mexican","Nightlife","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I have only been here twice, but so far it is the best Mexican fare I've had in Las Vegas.  They had a good chicken mole taco, a satisfying consommé, and authentic Mexico City offerings like the huarache.   My only complaint was the limited and undersized chairs and tables.  I am not sure if their usual clientele are umpa lumpas or elementary school children, but some adult sized tables would be an improvement.","i would give this place 5 stars if they would spend some extra money to fix it up. not much eye appeal but very clean. it was rated one of the best hidden places in vegas by npr critics. \nthe food is amazing at take out prices.\noh and they didnt accept cards a few months ago so check before you go","Best Mexican food I have had in this state. Hands down. Possibly the best Mexican food I have had on earth, but I have only been to Hermosillo, so what do I know? I know this is on both Best Places to Eat in Las Vegas tomes, or whatever it is called, penned by Curtas, Mancini, and that other guy everyone forgets (Jacobson)(I kid!). \n\nI had the Consumme Loco. Never heard of the plate before, and I am still not sure if it is a specifically named plate for this restaurant or widely called that. Don't know. It was delicious so I don't care. \n\nGirlfriend had a cheese quesadilla (she loved it)(said it was the best she had ever had) and for dessert we had platanos with the crazily unhealthy condensed milk spread over it and flan. Delicious, delicious, and delicious. Actually, I did not try the quesadilla so delete one of those deliciouses. Or not, the Consumme Loco deserves two deliciouses. \n\nThe bill was absurdly cheap. Really ridiculous. If I were to tip what I thought was missing from the bill should be costing, the tip would be larger than the actual bill. Since I am a cheapass, I only tipped like 30% of the bill into the cup by the cashier machine. \n\nI wish it was closer so I can go more often. I wish I still worked near there so I can go often. I feel like punching myself in the nuts for having eaten at Subway circa 2007/2008 and not having eaten at Los Antojos. And I worked with a Mexican-American who was legit Mexican (father always watch futbol; Spanish-language newspaper being delivered to house and always spread out being read; mother making insanely delicious lunches at house for everyone and adorably anxiously waiting for responses to if people liked it or not). Maybe he knew about Los Antojos and just secretly did not like me. \n\nIf you patronise this place and do not like what you eat, there might be something wrong with your taste buds or amygdala. There are no burritos here so don't be an turd and handicap your rating with less stars because you thought you were at Taco Bell®. - E","I was visiting LV for a conference and coming from CA I'm used to good Mexican food. When the valet at my hotel told me the place was goooood and to bring him back a surprise I wasn't worried at all.  The place is divey for sure, but it's great! I had the chilaquiles (a personal favorite) and they didn't disappoint.  It was so good I brought 5 CA colleagues back with me for dinner the same day. They were pleased with their meals as well - we all cleaned our plates.  One person said the tortilla soups was \"out of this world\" and another said the beans were nice a light - it's so easy to make them heavy.  It's in a strip mall and easy to miss, but make the U-ie and try again - it's worth it!","Finally! Mexican food with SOUL.....with 2 strikes(Casa Don Juan, and Las Islitas) I guess third time's the charm...\n\nLos Antojos does Mexican food typical of Mexico City and they do it pretty good! Inside is very modest with simple tables and chairs and pictures and signs of different dishes they offer. Sorry, you won't find Quesadillas that the general American public is familiar with, nor will you find Burritos here....you have been warned.\n\nWe ordered some Tacos-Tripa, Lengua, Suadero, Cochinita Pivil, and Mole de Pollo. We also got the Consomme Loco, Quesadilla de Rajas\nand a Huarache de Asada. I also got an Horchata-Homemade, not from the machine/instant.\n\nAll of the tacos were good, but the standout was the chicken mole, just like mole should taste. The Consomme Loco is a perfect example of simple food done right, DO get this if you ever dine here! Our first spoonful of this soup, the lady behind our counter saw our smiles and said \"Como Su Casa\"(\"Just like home\") It did feel as if we were guests in her home as she and her husband always checked on us to see that everything was okay. The Quesadilla was different in a good way...deep fried masa stuffed with cheese and strips of poblano peppers with a crisp exterior. The Huarache was good, but the carne asada was a little tough. We shared a cup of Strawberries and Cream and a Peach Gelatina for dessert. Overall, a good dinner, and definitely worthy of a return visit. You never know if you'll run into Chef Alex Stratta-Yup, this is his spot for Mexican fare....ALOHA!!!","Awesome...authentic street food. Pazole took me back!!!","I don't get over to the east side often so Los Antojos has been on my to try list forever, but I finally had the opportunity to give it a try. Walking in, I was overwhelmed by the menu. I wanted one of everything. I settled on the enchiladas with mole. I don't find it too often outside of my visits to Mexico so I had to try it. The husband ordered something else that sounded delicious. I don't recall now what it was because there was a mix up in the kitchen and they served two orders of mole. It mattered none to us. No sharing needed. Although, the mole sauce was bit too bitter. \n\nWhen I find myself in the area I'd seek our Los Antojos again and try another menu item.","The second time, for EVERYTHING, is never as good as the first. I am basing this on all of the experiences I have in my life on a plethora of matters (you can imagine). \n\nExcept Consume Loco. Consume Loco was perhaps fucking better the second time than the first. Motherfucker. Must be the exception to the rule or something. \n\nTried some tacos for the first time. Chose 'asada' for not particular reason; they were great. Flan and platanos fritos for dessert (again). Girlfriend had two cheese quesadillas. All of this, plus a complimentary plate of chips, for less than twenty five bucks (and that includes a GREATER THAN SYMBOL 25% tip). \n\nOnly at Los Antojos. I wish I lived closer so I can go more often, but I will continue to go way out of my way to enjoy this unbelievably delicious authentic Mexican cuisine. - E","I heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.\n\nThe restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.\n\nI opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.\n\nThe tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.\n\nWhen they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.\n\nI really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.\n\nWill I come back?  I'm torn....maybe to try the Tacos and give them a chance for redemption.","This place doesn't get anymore authentic. They have Classic Mexican that taste great.","We made a return visit for bowls of loco consommé, a delicious chicken rice soup with cilantro and avocado.  The soup is low fat and loaded with shredded chicken, avocado and cilantro.","This mom and pop Mexican restaurant serves authentic fare.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which came with chips & salsa, rice, refried beans and warm tortillas.  The owner also served us complimentary cups of their delicious consomme loco which is a fat free chicken rice soup spiked with cilantro.  Neither of us could do this bountiful meal justice.  Our bill fell short of the minimum purchase requirement on our gift certificate so we ordered a slice of flan to go.  Later the same day we shared the flan which we found to be tasty, but a bit too heavy.","My boyfriend has taken me here five times in the past two months, and it's just amazing! He speaks Spanish, so it's easier for us to order, but they do speak English and their menu is in both languages.\nMy favorite dish is the mushroom quesadillas- these are deep fried, not toasted, so it looks like an empanada. Every time we come the dish is prepared differently, which isn't a bad thing at all. The first time I got it the cheese was melted, but there was still small chunks of cheesy goodness, and the mushrooms were button mushrooms. The second time they still had button mushrooms, but they put in herbs and onions this time. Last night I got shitake mushrooms! Whhhaat??? It doesn't matter how many times they make it different, it's so good!\nMy boyfriend always gets the large Loco soup (it's a chicken soup with rice and avocado slices) and a small chicken taco. We brought my mom last night and she tried everything- now she's converted.\nThe desserts are to die for- we always get flan and fried plantains.They give you a very large slice of flan for about three dollars (try going later, when they are close to closing and they might just give you the rest of the flan they have) and the fried plantains are cooked to perfection, with sweetened condensed milk drizzled over for added sweetness.\nThe best part is it is SO cheap! Two large Loco soup (I mean LARGE), two mushroom quesadillas, one chicken taco, one flan, and one fried plantains= 25$ before tip.","Alambre...I'm officially a convert.  \n\nConsomme loco...crazy good.\n\nQuesadillas con rajas...rethink quesadillas...these are the real thing.\n\nVerde salsa...all other places should be green with envy.\n\nMama in the cocina...you're the cutest, nicest Mom -- as Mom & Pops go, that I've ever met in Las Vegas.  \n\nAnd your sweet neighbor a coupla doors down that sells raspados -- definitely cool...\n\nCan't wait to come back.  \n\nCash only.","I was feeling a bit under the weather, so I was really craving some chicken soup. I mentioned this to my roommate and she immediately suggested that I go to Los Antojos and have their Consome Loco. I stopped by and immediately fell in love with this tiny place. It reminds me of the hole in the wall restaurants my mom and I love to go to. It's very cozy and the people are very nice. \n\nThe soup was very simple, yet delicious. Exactly what I needed while I was sick. It had chicken broth, shredded chicken, and avocado. It was perfectly seasoned and definitely hit the spot. This will be my go to place when I'm not feeling well. I would also love to stop by and try some of their other menu items.","This place is the business! best MEXICAN  restaurant on the east side!!! although i don't ever dine in (just because it so small, and a place like this you wanna take your time and savor every bite!.....that great!....and i don't want people giving me the evil over  over a table). Its so worth it. I recommend the Hurache and Alambres but everything on the menu is great thats just my personal FAVORITE.","The rice and beans are delicious.  I ordered the Taquiza taco plate (my choices: suadero, carnitas, pollo con mole, lengua) and besides the mole, none of the meats were distinguishable, they all looked more or less the same and even had a similar consistency and grill flavor.  If i come back I won't order tacos, as they were mostly flavorless.  I am not a huge mole fan, but it was tasty.  The salsas they serve alongside the food sucked:  one verde, one chipotle.  They both tasted unsalted and watered down.  Ive had better, more flavorful salsa from a can (Herdez brand).  The man at the register cared more about the movie on the TV than the customers.\nTaco y Taco is so much better?","Bookmarked this place after seeing their pambazo torta listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out.\n\nI ordered the torta, and added on a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review.\nThe quesadilla was a surprise- as others have said, I was initially surprised to see what was essentially a fried, folded tortilla, but after it cooled a bit, I took a bite. That first bite did not wow me. But after the second I took a third, and after the third, I found a mushroom. Jackpot! That thing is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back.\n\nBut back to the torta that originally brought me in.\nTo say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy to the point that it was difficult to eat with my hands. The bread appeared to be soaked in the grease from the chorizo, and I got orange all over my fingertips, hands, and mouth, simply trying to take a bite. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican food, but this was overkill.\nWhat was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor.  I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish. \n\nI don't know how this torta made anyone's list of great foods, or if I simply received something other than what they usually serve- but this is not something I'd care to eat again.\n\nMany reviews mention the fabulous mole, and if I'm hungry and hankering for Mexican in the area in the future, I'll consider giving it a try. But for now, I'm going to be a bit more cautious about the food articles in LV Weekly.","Best authentic Mexian place in town.  They have so many optins.  Go with the chicken mole verde.  It is delcious.\n\nEnchiladas rock, the alambra is good too.\n\n\nShrimp cocktail isnt that great though- I've had much better.","Whole in the wall\n\noff the strip\n\nsmall and ususally crowded (which means its good)\n\neverything in this place is good. everything. try it, you will love it. \n\nI ate at the Wynn buffet the night before...I paid $36 at the Wynn...for food that lacked flavor and personality. At Los Antojos I paid $12 for food that is made fresh, with love, with flaovr, perosnality, just amazing. \n\n5 stars.","This a great find if you are looking for more traditional Mexican food styled more like the food in Mexico city. Sorry suckas, you're gonna have to step out of your burrito bubble and order something else!\n\nWe tried the consommé loco which is a chicken soup. It was very simple, some people might say bland, but I can imagine craving it when I am sick and would like a simple chicken soup without all that extra tortilla soup stuff. It's just shredded chicken, rice, and a few vegetables. Overall tasty and ok for the $6 price. \n\nI also ordered the alambre which I have eaten elsewhere before. It was ok but I think I could have spent my $9 on something else on the menu. The deep fried quesadillas and raspados looked great so that might be a good option.\n\nI nabbed half a chicken mole taco and was delighted. Great flavor, maybe a bit too much sauce...but hey if you want moist saucy mole tacos this is the place!\n \nIf you are in the area, stop by and try it out. A small place but the menu is pretty big. If you are looking for something like Roberto's this is not the place; much more authentic dishes served in a sit down setting. Maybe one day they will replace the elementary school chairs and tables, but for now...","Delightful, inexpensive Mexico City inspiried food.  The meat is well cooked, and has a flavor different from what you'd find at anything ending in *bertos.","Los Antojos just got a killer review by John Curtas:  eatinglasvegas.com  http://www.eatinglv.com/2009/07/los-antojos/  Congratulations!   This is actually it's 2nd great article in a couple of weeks -- the first as a shout out from Alex Stratta in Las Vegas Weekly.\n\nIf only all the great mom & pop places in Vegas/Henderson, could get their 15 minutes -- \n\noh right, that's what Yelp's supposed to be...but all you bozos keep writing about are the big strip joints to get your review counts up.  And the rest have covered In n Out enough to last an eternity.   Oh, and don't forget the myriad of idiots who order wrong at Lotus, then trash it.  Seriously, you think we can't tell...?!\n\nPlease, people.  Broaden your horizons.  There are great gems still waiting to be discovered.","I like this place because of the \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere and it's family owned.  The reason I return over and over is because of the chili rellenos. They make it right on point here and the sauce is seasoned and mild. (** = Must try)\n\nPROS: Chili Rellenos**\n             Bottled Coke\n             Lengua Torta\n             Chicken Consomme**\n\nCONS:  Carne asada meat is on the tough side\n              Loud TV","Stopped by to cure my hangover hunger :) on a Sunday afternoon. I live in the area  but never been to this hole-in-the-wall yet so I was kind of intrigued after seeing review about this place in LV Weekly.\n\nOrdered few tacos and sope and quesadilla. All was good but I'd like to come back and try more stuff to see what's the hype. \nIt should be all good because place was packed (although it is very small  inside).","Imagine a dinky, but very authentic place that actually has little Mexican women running around the kitchen making small, but tasty dishes that aren't easily found anywhere else in Vegas.\n\nGreat, right? Yes, but...\n\nThis place is dinky, and no money was spent on the seating, at all. There's limited beverage choices. The portions are not going to individually make anyone fat. And the ambiance is, well, you waste no time getting right to your meal and concentrating on your meal.\n\nThe plus is that the mole' is fan-frigging-tastic. The tacos ( while small ) are spicey and chock-full of zesty flavor. The beans are freshly made and have never even seen a can. And there is a great smell wafting from the kitchen and blanketing the place.\n\nDefinitely worth venturing into for authentic Mexican cuisine if you can put up withthe other elements of Mexican culture- the bull-riding on TV, the rickety, cheap furnishings, etc. etc. No date night glamour here, but a good foodie adventure for the gringo's nonetheless.\n\nBeing bi-linqual, or having a translator is a definite plus. Or just point and mumble if you don't speak Spanish. They'll get the point. And they're pretty cool about it, too.\n\nAlso- best mole sauce in town so far. Make it 3 and 1/2 stars!","I love this place!  The employees are always really nice and the food is amazing!  The chicken soup tastes like something grandma would make.  The enchiladas are rich and delicious.  The flan--homemade and everything flan should be.  Everything on the menu is awesome!  Great prices, but it's cash only.","Rumor has it the flautas are amazeballs. Let's see...\n\nThe above comment was my check in at Los Antojos.\n\nThe excitement ended with that sentence. It wasn't good at all. A Flauta, at least where I come from, is pretty simple. Take everything that a taquito and/or rolled taco is and instead of using a corn tortilla use a flour tortilla. Los Antojos uses Corn tortillas making these not flautas, but rolled tacos. They were pretty good, but not at all what I was expecting. I also wasn't crazy about the take out presentation. Instead of topping off the fake flautas with sour cream and lettuce they were all packaged seperately. I apprecate the consideration of soggy fake flautas, but one thing I love is the pre-made orchaestration of my rolled tacos and/or flautas. I accept the fact that the middle one may be a 3-napkiner, that's okay. Don't make me construct my own lunch though. \n\nGiven the reviews I was disappointed, but I only tried one thing on the menu. Not sure I will be back to try another. I will say the place was packed for lunch and several people were eating soup, so maybe I should go a different route if there is a next time.","I think it's hilarious that someone would knock off an entire star for this place not having burritos. What we in the U.S. call \"burritos\" doesn't even exist in Mexico. That's an absurd Americanized thing. \nThat being said, I'll get on with the review, starting with the disclaimer that\n\nTHIS PLACE DOES NOT SELL MEXICAN-AMERICAN food. \nPeople that are expecting nachos and burritos--sorry. Go to Taco Bell.\n\nThis place sells LEGIT, MEXICAN food that you would only otherwise find in MEXICO CITY, MEXICO. Phew. Okay, there. \n\nAND, it's some of the best food I've had outside of Mexico City, to boot. \nI haven't found any other place where I can order tortilla soup and get authentic tortilla soup. And where else would I be able to find mole verde?! MOLE VERDE. There is a huge variety of amazing food on the menu. I also saw them (WITH MY OWN EYES) start to make the food only after I had ordered it. I made awesome conversation with the woman who owns the place; sooo friendly, so chatty, always asking if we needed anything else. And at the end of the experience everything was fairly and moderately priced. To be honest, the food was so delicious that I would've paid double what I paid for that tortilla soup. \n\nI WILL RECOGNIZE that the interior of the place isn't exactly charming. It's a little run down, with that faint layer of grease that usually coats well used restaurants. It's small and the tables are surprisingly close to the ground -- Buuuuuut I couldn't care less. The food makes up for anything that might be aesthetically displeasing as far as seating goes. \n\nTry this place out. I could rave and rave about it. For days. That's what I'm doing now. \n\n:]","I suggest the Consome Loco!","it was okay.. nothing more.  the place is really cramped with tiny plastic chairs (like in a classroom) and small tables to match.  this didn't bother me much because i'm tiny too.  the tables weren't sticky either, so that's a plus.  we went at around noon on a wednesday and there were 3 people sitting there eating or watching the olympics on the television.  the guy at the counter was really nice and spoke more english than i expected.  he explained to us what certain things on the menu were and poured us two cups of water.  from your tables, you can see the kitchen right behind the counter and it looks really big and clean.. so one star for that.\n\n  i took my mom here and we ordered two tacos and the highly recommended consomme loco (i got a junior size).  all together it costed around 6 dollars and some change.. so that wasn't that bad.  the tacos were the size of a toddler's hands (super tiny) and according to my mom, they were nothing special.  the consomme loco came in a medium sized bowl with pieces of cilantro and onion floating around.  there was shredded chicken and mexican rice in the bottom of the clear broth.  now lets talk about the taste.. it tasted almost exactly like slightly watered down chicken flavored top ramen.  i don't know if it's that top ramen is really good, or this soup is really bad but i didn't really think it was as good as other people said it was.  after eating that soup, i'm left with a really dry and thirsty taste in my mouth.  even though i got the junior size bowl, it was actually really filling and i had to force myself to spoon down the last few drops.  for filling me up, i'll give it another star.  \n\noverall, the food wasn't great but at least it wasn't nasty.. i grew up with a lot of mexican friends whose mothers made delicious soup for us all the time, so that's what i was expecting when i came here.  it's not a place i would come to again.  \np.s. cash or debit only","we came here on a sunday afternoon and ordered 6 tacos: (2 carnitas, 2 asada, and 2 tinga) and a horchata for 12. \n\n- tacos comes with little meat. compared to el gordo (which although is a bit more expensive), they pack their tacos with more meat and has more flavor.\n- asada has too much fat. small pieces.\n- tinga and carnitas were nothing special (shredded beef and pork)\n- misfire. they sprinkle the cilantro and onions on. few tacos had alot and others had none! lol.\n- the mom hooked it up with a free refill of horchata :)!","I'll trek across town for this mole again, for sure!","The food is made to order and tastes great.  It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time.","I first encountered cochinita pibil at the Taco Bus in Tampa, Florida, and I've been searching for it ever since. Although there is a version of it at Border Grill at Mandalay Bay, I wanted something a little less upscale, and when I read about Los Antojos on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try it.\n\nMy husband loves cochinita pibil even more than I do, so he ordered the plate lunch. For less than $8, he got a platter of tasty pork (seasoned with citrus and achiote) with the traditional picked onions, along with rice, beans, and tortillas. I had two cochinita pibil tacos, which were like the small street fare I expected; and a small bowl of the consomme loco, which is a simple chicken, rice, and cilantro soup topped with avocado. Although the soup was tasty, next time I think I'll stick with the tacos, and maybe try one of the others listed on the menu -- the ham and pineapple (jamón y piña) sounds intriguing.\n\nThe restaurant itself doesn't look much different from the dozens of similar strip-mall establishments located throughout the city, but the variety of menu options -- especially the inclusion of the aforementioned cochinita pibil (did I say how much I love it?) -- make this \"hole in the wall\" one worth visiting.","I am not sure how this small, casual, Mexico City-type eatery managed to find its way on the dining guide, Eating Las Vegas:  The 50 Essential Restaurants, but, but the clear chicken broth with an abundance of rice, cilantro, shredded chicken and avocado always satisfies in a way only a homemade soup could.","The food in this joint is based on street food you find in Mexico city. It's not fancy Lindo Michoacan type where the waiter makes you guacamole at your table\n. It's a small place, so don't come here expecting great seating.","Go for the tamarindo drink. That was pretty good. \n\nTacos were somewhat dry. Mole was less than I expected, although I have to say that not too many places do mole. Consomme was pretty good, but it's chicken broth, avocado and strips of chicken. It's gonna be good! I had the taquiza. The rice and beans were awesome. The taco's different meats were just not too impressive. I tried the Suadero, Tinga, Al Pastor, Mole, and Tripa. Their meats are not juicy enough for me. The tortillas here were perfect. They were soft and fresh. Everything was really fresh, but the culinary desire for more leads me to rate them a three-star. Even their white onion and cilantro could have been more finely chopped.\n\nTheir chicken enchiladas came with mole. I have had many great moles. This mole was not a great one. It was a good one. \n\nI lived in Mexico City, D.F. The tacos I had there were absolutely mindblowing. People would stand around taco stands and they would give you consomme as well. The animal fat would serve as the grease for the backdrop of flavorful meat for each taco. The toppings such as cilantro and onions were finely finely chopped. The grill that they used were the ones similar to the ones being used at Tacos El Gordo, even though TEG is Tijuanan style.\n\nAt Los Antojos, I feel that the execution of the food could have been so much better and reading all the reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Yes, perhaps some may say that I'm harsh, but if they advertise a regional food, and certain people go there for that regional food, that food should reach or exceed the standards. If this were in Mexico, it would have been one of the least busiest stalls in even areas like Tacubaya. \n\nIt is possible that the person cooking my food was an employee instead of the mama other people mention in their reviews. Thus, I will definitely try to come back when the mama is there.","Went today for lunch.  Found this place in the book \"Eating Las Vegas\" along side Michelin star restaurants.  Small, clean place with pictures of their plates and hand written specials on the wall. I'm not a mexican food guy so I was a little intimidated but the guy who took my order was very nice, spoke English and was able to make helpful suggestions.  I tried their Mole de pollo as recommended by fellow yelpers. Wow! Though I never had mole before, good food is good food and the mole was delicious. Chicken was tender and moist. I mopped the plate clean with the steaming hot tortillas that come with the plate. They had a drink called \"Mango water\". Amazing. So good. Refreshing and not too sweet. I complimented the mole as I was leaving and as we talked about the food I could tell that he took a lot of pride in his food. I will definitely be back. Viva la Mexico!","Flautas are a must have.....mmmmm good.\nNice people Great food... that's a winning combo!","I had tried Los Antojos a couple of years ago after reading John Curtas go on about how great it was. A friend and I went and tried a bunch of different things, like huaraches, and consome loco and were not very impressed.\n\nFast forward 2 years and everybody I know has been to the restaurant and are raving about it. My friend and I decided to give it another chance. This was three weeks ago and I have been back at least ten times. This place is fantastic! I have been here for both breakfast and lunch, and I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried. For breakfast they offer a ton of choices and if nothing on the menu suits you, they can also whip something up. I tried eggs with chorizo and huevos rancheros, both come with different sides like beans, tortillas, bread, etc. My husband tried the borrego (lamb), it comes with a side bowl of consome (super, super rich), cilantro, onions and your choice of bread or tortilla. The owner assured him that with his meal he wouldn't need another meal all day. He was super happy with it, although it was a bit too rich for me. For lunch we've tried the tostadas de tinga (holy crap, they are incredible), tostadas de pollo (meh), sopa de tortilla, tampiqueña and pambazos. Pretty much everything was great. Also, all of their aguas frescas are made in-house. \n\nSince the place is tiny it gets packed quickly, but you can get your food to go. My husband and I are quite obsessed!","I love this place. This place is a real hidden gem in Las Vegas, it's my go to spot for an authentic Mexican meal. The entire menu is outstanding and very affordable. The people are great, very comfortable, homely atmosphere, very welcoming. Soups, tacos, gorditas, huarache, tortas, flan....everything here is great. Highly recommended.\n\nEverything that I've had here has been great but so far my favorite bites have been the enchiladas Pollo De Mole and consomme loco.\n\nThe enchiladas pack a punch of flavor with the mole and the consomme loco is just a great example of less is more.","Went on a Friday for lunch for the first time. Small hole on the wall type restaurant with 5 small tables and a counter. Employees are super friendly and responsive. I had the consume loco and the tacos cochinita pibil. Both were very delicious! The soup starts off a little bland but throw in a few scoops of green salsa, a couple of the red and a squeeze of lime and now we're talking!","After hearing about this place on KNPR I decided to come down, with my best Mexican friend in tote (just in case I needed translation on the menu), to try this place out.  I do not recommend using Google maps to locate this place, instead look out for it on the southeast corner of Sahara and Eastern.  Upon arriving, it does not look like much, and at first glace I thought I had arrived upon a venue that did not sell food at all, but after reading the words \"taco\" and \"enchilada\" written on the glass window, I breathed a sigh of relief.  We entered and saw the crammed 9 table (plus bar top seating on the side) seating area with a counter top right behind.  After trying my best to decipher the Spanish on the menu (with the help of my friend), I settled on the chicken mole enchilada (~$8) and the tortilla sopa (~$5).  My friend, who had also brought her roommate, got the milanesa (~$10) and the chicken flautas (~$8).  After ordering we sat at one of the tables stuffed in the corner to await our meal.  On the table was an open container with what appeared to be some type of hot sauce, typical of Mexico City style fare, according to my friend.  Our meal arrived complete with rice, beans, and a few tortilla chips right on the plate.  My mole, which can be explained as a curry-like sauce containing chocolate, was rich, sweet and savory.  I tried some of the flautas, topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and queso.  Crispy on the outside with soft, juicy chicken on the inside.  The milanesa, according to my friend was good too.  The tortilla sopa was savory and sour from the lime and sour cream.  Definitely a must try.  The questionable sauce in the open dish was, in-fact, hot sauce, chipotle hot sauce to be exact.   All in all I gave this place 5 stars because the price is decent, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.  I will definitely come here again, possibly to try out the other goodies on the menu.  I recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous and loves good Mexican food at decent prices.  This is not a place for those who are expecting a fine-dining, or even a Chili's-style dining experience, nor the obsessive compulsive clean. \n**CASH ONLY**","I've never been one for Mexican food but this place has changed my mind. Most items seemed to be small plate-esque so I ordered two small looking items to get variety: sopes and quesadillas.  The cashier went out of his way to explain that the quesadilla wasn't the typical quesadilla but through the pictures I had figured as much.  It was smaller than what we typically expect and it was fried...still cheese filled and amazing.  The sopes was a corn shell with beans lettuce and sour cream on it.  They had other varieties but went with vegetarian.  Both items were under $3 which makes for a cheap lunch.  They also offer soda pop in the old retro glass bottles which is kind of cool.\n\nNow, why I almost take away a star.  A man walked in to apparently try and sell customers some items...meanwhile the cashier/maybe owner/manager locks the door.  Maybe I am just paranoid but it felt like they were trapping us in there.  There just seemed to be a lot of looks being shot around the room and it was freaking me out.  \n\nIf I am in vegas again I would surely stop in but mayhaps take it to go. But seriously, amazing food!","This tiny storefront restaurant has received a measure of notoriety since an article appeared in the Las Vegas Weekly indentifying it as celebrity Chef Alex Stratta's favorite restaurant for authentic Mexico City cuisine.  Alex was dining elsewhere this day, but the restaurant was fairly busy.  Orders are placed at the counter and then while waiting for the food you can munch on not so authentic taco chips served with two homemade salsas, tomatillo and chipotle.  We each ordered a bowl of consommé loco, a rich chicken broth with shredded chicken, avocado and fresh cilantro that were accompanied by a pair of fresh corn tortillas - muy bueno!\n\nA week later we returned for lunch and again enjoyed the consomme loco."],"business_id":"j8qsf2QbpgkUwTe3RORLBw","name":"Los Antojos","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["After numerous visits,  this restaurant is still tops! Great location and wonderful decor. Most importantly the food is awesome!","A place that probably won't last, which is too bad. There's nothing bad to say about the restaurant, service, or food. Unfortunately there isn't anything good to say about the food either. The food is fine, it's just not worth going back for. Gave 4 stars because its clean & servers are nice.","A blurb in Phoenix magazine caught my eye (great chips and salsa and $3 happy hour margaritas) and the 4 star Yelp ratings said it was worth a try. Happy to report that this place exceeded all our expectations. Chips and salsa are excellent, the margaritas are great (though we missed the happy hour special) and the food is fresh and excellent. Yelp had a 20% coupon which they gladly accepted. Our food came and it was as advertised fresh and very tasty. The guacamole that came with my carne asada was in a fried tortilla bowl which I ate after wolfing down the freshly made contents. Overall the food and friendly service will certainly bring us back here again.","Went to try this after months of driving by. Its right by our house so we thought we would finally give it a try. The food was ok and way overpriced. I paid $10.99 for a chimichanga that was the size of a taco bell bean burrito and the beans werent very good either. I will not be back. Macayo's here I come!","Over priced, ($23. for an enchilada dinner and a bowl of soup and 1 iced tea) small portions, (is there a shortage on rice and beans) food just warm, no hot sauce available, lousy service and they need to find servers that can speak English!\n\nPlenty of better places around.","We just discovered this place and loved it! I had the enchilada deluxe with ground beef and green sauce and my boyfriend had a carne asada burrito. Their food is just great and the staff very friendly. I enjoy coming here once a week, if you go on a Friday they have live music playing. It's very very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking for great Mexican food.","Perfectly good Mexican food in Glendale. The hot tortilla chips and spicy salsa keep coming throughout the meal. The carnitas were dry, yet had a lot of flavor. Margaritas were fine, typical sour mix and cheap tequila. The restaurant is accommodating to larger groups and splitting checks. This was my second time and I enjoyed it. Not the best mexican in the whole world, yet very tasty.\n\n*BONUS - check in on yelp on your phone and take 20% off your bill","Excellent food, extensive menu, a+++","I recently returned to the valley and found this gem in my old neighborhood. \nEvery dish my wife and I have tried has been great. Excellent spicy salsa! Love the ceviche appetizer and seafood entrees too.  \nClean, bright and cheerful décor combined with a great serve staff make this my go to Mexican restaurant.","The BEST salsa lives here!  The restaurant is very clean, has cute booths, and friendly service.  Fajitas were tasty and we really enjoyed this restaurant.","Great quality! Best Mexican food in Glendale, nice decor, good service!","This is a solid place! We have been here a few times and they get an A+ on, fresh tasting food, friendliness and cleanliness!  Everything we have ordered has been really good. Ceviche is great and is loaded with fresh seafood, tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado! .Yummy! Give them a try!","I have been here about twenty times. It was good from the start, but, every time there is some little improvement that impresses me even more. Last night I had theh 9 oz New York Strip medium rare, rice, whole pinto beans, a chile relleno. and some flour tortillas.  I always dump a whole little dish of their fresh salsa on my rice. I also had a margarita the way I prefer them with Cointreau and Corralejo Blanco Tequila. Everything was very tasty.  I will get the exact same thing next time.","Seeing all the 5 Star Reviews, I made a point of stopping into Anaya's for lunch today.  I ordered my usual once or twice a week Mexican lunch, a Chile Relleno Combo with rice, refried beans & a hard shell shredded beef taco.\n                                                                                                                                            `\n\n\nTHE BEST:     :-))\n\n*  Stylish, casual, mid-sized full service restaurant with a full bar.\n\n*  Friendly, attentive service.\n\n*  Very inexpensive!\n\n*  Both the chips & the salsa were 5 Stars!\n\n*  Excellent menu choices & layout.\n\n*  Good-sized Pablano Chile Relleno.\n                                                                                                                                           `\n\n\nTHE OK:     :-)\n\n*  Portion sizes overall.\n\n*  I thought the rice was a little better than average.\n\n*  The beans & taco were passable.\n                                                                                                                                           `\n\n\nThe NOT-AS OK:     :-|\n\n*  The music was playing too loudly.\n\n*  My Chile Relleno seemed a little undercooked.\n\n\nChile Relleno & Taco Lunch Combo is only $6.25 (plus another 20% off for Srs. on Tuesdays!).     :-))","Uses lard and chicken stock.... Not very friendly or knowledgeable. Would not return.","My first visit to this cafe and it was wonderful.I ordered the chipotle chicken, very delicious, good flavor, it was Saturday evening and to my surprise, there was a mariachi band, how nice to have a fresh new  restaurant in my neighborhood.","Excellent. Friends and I arrived there for an early lunch prior to our flight from PHX. Delicious food, fun atmosphere, and attentive service. \n\nI with I lived in Phoenix so I could come back more often! We could not have been happier.","I've been in Arizona for 11 years and finally we have found a Mexican restaurant that we love.  In two days I've eaten here twice.  First day I had their street tacos and day two I had their carnitas and they were both excellent.  Anaya's is clean, comfortable, great prices and tasty.  I highly recommend it!","Been here a couple times and I've left happy each time.\nThe food is good, not authentic really, but definitely good.\nThe margarita flavors are interesting (banana?) but also good.\nI would definitely come back.\nOh, and parking is usually super easy because it's in a shared lot.","i went based on good to great recent reviews.and they didnt disappoint. i had machaca breakfast w/came w/rice n beans n tortillas. however, when asked for another order of tortillas i wasnt informed there was a charge. to my surprise it was $1.50 for 2 small flour tortillas. you can get a dozen  for .99........anyways food was good but lil things like that dont sit well w/me n im sure you can agree. like free refills or extra salsa come on guys...ill bring to their attention next time personally...","Great food, great service. Try the super hot sauce.","Great food!\nFriendly service!\nAttractive restaurant!\n\nAnaya's Fresh Mexican food is how they bill themselves. Fresh for sure!  I loved my dish. It was arroz con pollo (chicken with rice). An attractive plate that included lightly sauteed zucchini, mushrooms and peppers in a spicy sauce. A generous dish so I had leftovers--a lot of food for the price. Lunch buddy enjoyed the same dish except with prawns (shrimp).\n\nAnaya's has an extensive menu, the usual Mexican fare but lots of different dishes and many that included seafood. They open early and even have a drive thru where you can get takeouts, like breakfast burritos or lunch or dinner. How convenient!\n\nThe Mexican furnishings and decor are authentic and outstanding--a cheerful atmosphere. Our server had a great attitude, friendly and helpful. \n\nAnaya's is a new family-owned restaurant in Glendale. I hope it does well because it has a lot to offer. Looking forward to another visit and trying some other dishes.","Fourth time in and has been excellent every time. Some of the best chips and salsa and excellent margaritas. Latest dish I've had was the Chile Verde, very fresh and tasty. Highly recommended.","Tried it today for the first time. The food was very good and reasonably priced. My only \"complaint\" is the server never asked if we needed  refills on our drinks, which we did. The spicy, but very awesome salsa was the culprit. I will be back, I'm sure.","Met a coworker up at this place at first glance it looks like a generic Mexican restaurant chain that ends with bertos. Once I stepped in I thought I was in Narnia, colorful walls and animated tables and chairs filled the room. They were playing traditional regional mexican music reminded me of my friend Alan's house ( he's a Mexican that I met looking for work outside Home Depot) . The menu has fair prices for the quality of food they serve I ordered the huevos rancheros with a Jamaica ( you get one free re fill). The waiter was very friendly he looks like aziz ansari he was very efficient. All in all it was a good experience. I will be coming back to try the melon margarita.","Anaya's is a great place to eat some legit Mexican food, and I'm from New Mexico where we love spicy. The salsa is actually pretty good and has a little spice to it. It's really hard to find good salsa in Arizona. So it's a pleasant surprise. If you have kids, they even bring out a not-at-all spicy version of their salsa and I find that to be awesome. I normally get the make-your-own combo plate with three items, chicken or beef taco, chicken enchilada, and red tamale. The taco is amazing 9 out of 10 times. That one time, it will come out a little to crispy or burnt. The enchilada is on point. As for the tamale, the first time I ordered it it was spicy and had great flavor. Since then, I feel that the masa has been extra lard-y tasting. So beware. If you're in the mood for an adult drink, try the \"Bartender's Special Margarita\" Mmm! All-in-all, they have great service, a great atmosphere and above average food. And for an added taste of Mexicana, go there on a Saturday evening for live mariachi music.","I just happened upon this place one day and I have to say the food is really good.  I am always on the hunt for good Mexican food, which is very hard to come by in Phoenix.\n\nMy first visit I had the pozole.  It was so good!  The service was friendly and the place looked new and clean!  I am a fan!","The restaurant was very nice looking and clean. My wife had the Arizona Chimi and said it was alright. I ordered the New york Steak and Mas AND IT WAS AWFUL!l! \n\nI ordered it medium rare. It came out with a suspicious gray color and well done. The server offered to bring out another. When it arrived, it too was gray. Upon cutting it in the center, it was a dull color, yet some of the edges of the steak were deep red and cold.\n\nIt was then that I realized that they may put \"grill\" marks on the steak, they actually cook it in a microwave oven. I've seen that gray color before and the uneven (raw) nature of the cooking confirmed it.\n\nI was polite in declining another \"steak\" yet the server never apologized and still charged for half the plate.\n\nWe finished our dining experience, politely paid the check, and left.\n\nI doubt we will go back. Too many other choices out there and microwaved, cold steak is NOT one of them. This was around 4:30pm on Monday, 8/12/2013","This place was good ...i felt like I was at my friend Alans house!!! lets just say I felt like I was in Mexico with the music playing..the food was fresh very tasty. Chips in salsa was on point like a box cutter. People were friendly ..overall place was clean and I will be coming here more often ..no more Filismoothies for this litto stomach.","Pleasantly surprised!  Nice atmosphere, great service, and very tasty food!","I was really skeptical coming to this restaurant because there were only 5 reviews. \n\nThe interior seating reminds me of some of the local restaurants in Mexico. Brings back joyful memories and a sense of comfort.  \nThe host was friendly and welcoming. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with the menu. \n\nI ordered the chicken mole which was tasted fresh and delicious! My wife had a mini-chimichanga with shredded chicken. She also enjoyed the food. My 5-year old son ate his rice and beans. He doesn't normally eat well at restaurants if he doesn't like the food. He loved it!\n\nThey also have a full bar with 2 flat screens hanging at both ends.\n\nThe service and food here is excellent and I am definitely coming here more often. \n\n5 stars!","Excellent Mexican Food, service and atmosphere! Try their Breakfast...the BEST we have had in all of Glendale!","Clean place, great salsa, great service and really good food!  So glad we had lunch here. Do yourself a favor and try the Carne asada.","I like the place so far, the breakfast burritos are awesome.  I had also ordered the pollo fundido but that is just okay.  The chips and salsa are fantastic and the service is always good.  I like the casual atmosphere, you can tell it was a fast food place because they have a drive thru but I think that is only for pick up now.  I would have to say it is the nicest casual Mexican place I have been too.","This restaurant is fast becoming our neighborhood restaurant... let me tell you why.  First, you feel at home, always a smile, super super clean, the service is fast but the food is delish and hot.  The Blue margarita... is must have!!!! after one, you can't drink and drive... hahaha, sooooooooo good.  Bottom line is, we love it... we go once a week, the price is so good, we can actually afford to go once or twice a week.  I hope it stays the way it is... plus my hubby loves when the waiter call him \"my friend\" LOL.","Found this very very nice Mexican restaurant close to 43rd & Dunlap \nIt's called Anaya's \nFood is amazingly tasty  & the guys/dames who run this place are very hospitable & friendly!!!\nThat means a lot coming from a picky eater & a food critic like me - as you know!\nU should come here with ur friends!\nThey have a full bar!!","I have been wanting to try Anayas for a while now but my husband was skeptical. He either wants Macayo's for sit down or Filiberto's for drive thru. Anaya's is a little bit of both.  \n\nStopped in on a Friday night around 6:30 to find it empty except 1 table with 3 diners. That was a red flag but we were greeted promptly and the restaurant was exceptionally clean, even the restrooms were spotless. We were seated quickly and immediately were given chips and salsa, and without asking they brought out basically tomato sauce for my 5 year old son. He was ecstatic, he had his own salsa and it made him feel special.\n\nI wasn't really feeling Mexican..I know, I know, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. My husband ordered the Expresso Burrito with Asada, the child ordered off the kid's menu. All items are only $3.99 and come with either rice & beans or fries. He wanted the kid's cheese crisp. I tried to get him to order something else..so we could share, but he wasn't having it.  My husbands Aunt ordered a Pastor street taco with rice. \n\nFood came out quickly and was plated attractively.  My cheese crisp looked run of the mill, but I have to say it was exceptional. I'm really can't place what they did to that tortilla but it was delightfully crisp..almost like it was deep fried.  Husbands burro was of good size but he said the meat was cooked to much. I tried it and I would order it next time. To me the meat was carmelized from the grill and had excellent flavor. Aunt said the Pastor was good, she would visit and order the same thing again.  I did try the son's rice & beans. The beans had a good taste but the rice was just run of the mill spanish rice.\n\nOur first dining experience at Anaya's was a excellent one, and it's a place we keep on our list. For 3 adults and a child our bill was only $40 and that included a margarita, Dos XX's and a soda. Fresh, fast food in a friendly, clean atmosphere. I hope they survive in this economy, it's a great neighborhood restaurant.","I used to go to this place before it burned down so I figured I would give it a shot since it was completely rebuilt.  I was disappointed to find out it was a totally new owner, name, recipes and menu.  They did an outstanding job of renovating the place.\n\nI came in for lunch one day and ordered the fajitas.  The food was just okay.  Your typical run of the mill mexican restaurant.  I was disappointed with the portions as they were rather small.  For the amount of money I spent I feel that the portions were skimpy and therefore I havent been back.","We were just out and about, stopped in. My expectations were drop kicked to the curb. This place was awesome. I really enjoyed the food. The beans seemed home made like my momma's.  The service was awesome. It was very clean and really enjoyable. I will be back to combat my hangovers with some good ceviche.","It's good food (what the rest of my party had) and great service, but my entree fell short. It wasn't bad just unremarkable. I mark a good Mexican restaurant by how well they make their chile rellenos - this one had the seeds still in it. Which shows lack of attention to details in prep and just ruins the chile. It was flavorless and I pushed it aside. Super attentive servers.  Fast refills. Really good prices for food and drinks, including Margaritas."],"business_id":"jWkrsOMpBEqGK0gd6dxBKg","name":"Anayas Fresh Mexican Restaurant","categories":["Food","Beer, Wine & Spirits","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I have been eating at this place for a few years! They have amazing food, but the staff has always been rude, but I put up w it because of the great good. It is on the dirty side! I got some food to go last night and found a hair in my Mexican Pizza! I won't be coming back!!!","Stumbled across this place with the boyfriend and we are craving Mexican food so we decided to go in . I had the number 13 which was two cheese enchilada with green chili sauce (has chunks of Mexican beef in the sauce) . It was rich and filling . I enjoyed it but the service was SUPER SLOW! We probably will come back but not unless we are in the area .","Suzie's has a lot of good Mexican food, like cheese crisps, tacos, enchiladas, and more. The service is sometimes slow but it is worth the wait. The Shrimp Javier is my favorite. I am a regular here, it's that good. The cheese enchiladas are  pretty good too. It's also kid-friendly which is nice. They also have cold beer, which is nice. Its not expensive, and that's nice too. Its a nice place to go to!!!","Worst service we have ever experienced. We came on a friday for lunch and the place was not very busy. Took 10 minutes to get a table since all of them were dirty and nobody around to clean them. Took another 15 minutes to place our order and it took them so long to bring our food out we almost left. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food quality was bland with no flavor. This is NOT authentic mexican food. Stay away from Suzies and you will thank me.","Susie's is fantastic. The Albondigas Soup is out of this world. They serve a mild and hot salsa with a complimentary basket of chips - both are outstanding. The beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are very good. I'm a big fan of Susie's! They've been there for over 20 years so they're doing something right!!!","If you don't want fancy,  this is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  Shrimp and fish street tacos are amazing.  Love their salsa and green Chile. My husband went here as a child. Family owned for decades. Family and service is very friendly.  Highly recommend!","Tasty food, lackluster service.  Probably won't go back.","What a joke. Worst service I think I've ever received. I feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment. We went because reviews on yelp. Awful. Vegetables weren't cooked all the way through. We were one of 3 tables and had to wait 30 minutes for food. We all ate cereal at home it was so bad. Cold, not cooked, no flavor. Shame on Susie.","Not impressed.\n\nThe service wasn't that great and my tacos were very greasy.","The food was decent, but probably not any better than something I'd get at filibertos for cheaper. It just seemed to lack flavor. The service was okay and the food was served quick so otherwise no major problems.","Best Mexican food in Tempe. Good people. Good food. You can order large quantities of rice and beans to re-heat throughout the week-if you're a busy student.","Went here last Saturday night for dinner on a blind date and was impressed w/this little diamond in the rough! Be careful that you don't drive past it - their signage is not lit up at night and not very big and I flew right by it! \n\nYes, it's nothing too fancy/pretty, but the food is great and the customer service is fast and friendly. I had the cheese enchilada and beef tamale and couldn't finish it - it was pretty tasty! My date had the Shrimp Javier and said he always orders that and seemed content with the quality. We both had ice cold Pacificos and had a great evening. \n\nI will definitely be back for more!","Front door the size of my college dorm room and decor inside as old as the hills. But the food is great. A little hole in the wall that always comes through in taste. My girlfriend is addicted to the carnitas tacos. Tiny street vendor style things, she can't get enough of them. \n\nI go for red chile and am always happy when I leave. Yeah it's not fancy, Yeah, it's never going to make it into Phoenix magazine. But it's good. period.","Super good! I haven't had anything bad yet. Both the red and green sauce are great. Good seafood options too.","Inexpensive, no-frills Mexican cuisine.  The vibe here is like you're eating Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant in AZ from the '80s, and it's definitely possible that all the decor hasn't changed much since the '80s.  \n\nI had a horchata and the chile relleno plate.  The horchata was nice- it was very creamy tasting and not too sweet, and they sprinkled some ground cinnamon on top for added flavor.  The chile relleno was quite good.  The breading was nice, and it was a good balance of chile to cheese.  The refried beans in the plate were also very tasty, but the rice was a little too crunchy for me.","I've lived in Arizona for 18 years so that makes me more than qualified to judge a Mexican restaurant when I eat at one. Today for lunch co-workers and I decided to eat at Susie's Mexican Cafe. We had previously visited this place before about 2 years ago and found that hardly anything has changed. \n\nDon't let appearances deceive you. The big red door is the only cool thing about the look and feel of this establishment. We were surprised when we entered and there was a line, but the line was full of people trying to pay. So we had to wait a while to be seated. When we sat down, I saw that the booth we were sitting in was held together by duct tape. Not a promising sign. Overall, the place was dirty. It needed a good power washing from top to bottom and I did not feel comfortable sitting there. However, after living here for such a long time I believe this is just par for the course for Mexican restaurants. Sad. \n\nEverybody who went said the food was good but not great. Surprising given that their motto is \"A Great Mexican Food Place\". They should replace the menus and update them as they have been in circulation for over two years. I had three shredded beef tacos. I think I would have rather had Jack-In-The-Box monster tacos instead. The taquitos looked rather good. I'm sure some menu items are better than others, but haven't verified. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked like standard Mexican food that you'd get at Macayo's or some other Mexican joint.\n\nThe lunch specials were $6.75 with our choice of 1 cent draft beer or fountain soft drink. Since I didn't drink any alcohol for lunch you can trust my review isn't tainted. The menu explicitly stated there are no free refills on drinks. Also your first basket of chips was free, but after that they were $2.15 each.  They won't do substitutions on their lunch menu and  they won't split the check. However when you go to pay, you can pay separately. Same difference. \n\nTo sum it up it was a sub par experience at least for me. I wasn't impressed, but rather underwhelmed. If you want better Mexican food, I would try Pedro's Mexican Restaurant, Blanco Scottsdale, Cervantes Restaurant, or Carolina's Mexican Food.","This was highly-recommended by some friends who have been coming here since they were kids. The green chili carne was definitely 5-star ... right up there with the best I've ever had. Rice and beans good too, as well as chips and very good salsa. \n\nMy husband loves chicken chimichangas/pollo fundidios. So, he got that. He said it was ok, but he wasn't too impressed, as he would rather get his from Garcias or Someburros. \n\nDaughter had bean burrito, and we shared a good cheese crisp. \n\nOh -- I had a margarita on the rocks. Decent price, but not a decent margarita. Too much like that fakey mix taste and was there any tequila in there? Not bad for the price; but I would just get water with lemon next time. \n\nI'll want to go back to try other items, though I may have to order that green chile burro again .. so good.","I have been coming to Susie's since I was about 5. I used to live around the corner, so we would walk here... and every time, except for maybe a few, I order the same thing... bean and cheese burrito with beans and rice on the side and an horchata. I have had other stuff and I like it a lot, but this brings back great memories for me. I was there when they did renovations. I love when they have a mariachi band. It is definitely a hole in the wall and service is so bad... but it gives it character. PLUS there beans and cheese are like crack... so damn good. Come here with friends when you have the time to sit and chat for awhile...","Oh dang.  Their chorizo Mexican pizza is to die for! Literally, you will die if you eat this due to the quart of greasy goodness that oozes out of the sausage onto the pizza.  Totally worth the cost of a funeral.","I have eaten here twice (hoping my first experience was just a bad fluke... but sadly it wasn't). The service at this place is HORRIBLE. My first visit, I told the waiter that this was my first time and he said \"that's nice\" and just walked away. It took forever to get drink refills, salsa for our chips, etc. The waiter just didn't care and treated us like we were inconveniencing his otherwise very lazy day (FYI, we were one of 3 tables in the entire place... it was pretty dead in there). The sad part is the food was actually pretty good, so we decided to give it another shot. The next time we went, the service level was just as bad even though we had a different server (a waitress this time). Asking for extra water, salsa, etc. seemed like such a chore for her... and she'd disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time, then come back with one little thing for one of the 3-4 tables of people (again, pretty dead in there) and would then disappear again... it really seemed like she was avoiding the customers. For such a small, dead place... you would think they would be trying to WOW their customers to drum up some new business, but no... they don't want you here. Customers are just a nuisance to them.","Went there on Saturday night.  It was a solid 3 star review.  Burritos were good, tacos fell apart because the shell was so crunchy when I bit into it.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.  Filibertos on Main and Dobson in Mesa is better.","{Actual Date of Visit: 12/1/11}\n\nMy visit started off rocky.  When I drove up, the outside of the place looked desolate and nondescript.  (Eyebrow raise).  Ummmm is that the door?  As I entered, I noticed the restaurant was really dark and not in a sexy-ambiance kind of way.  (\"Uh-oh\" I thought).  I approached the counter and received the side-eye for what I believed was my presentation of a Groupon for $10 of 20 worth of food.  \"Susie\" (I assume) examined my coupon for about a minute then said \"Ok\".   I was like, \"Sooooo, do i seat myself or...?\"  She answered, \"Have a seat, someone is coming.\"  I sat down and a waitress came to take my order.  After I ordered my food, the waitress came back to tell me the lunch special was excluded from the Groupon.  Fair enough.  So I had to start over again with not a lot of veggie options to choose from.  \n\nI got the two cheese enchilada which was good, not amazing, but definitely good enough to order 2 more to go to finish off my Groupon,lol.  I liked the rice that came along with it.  For desert, I ordered the sopapillas.  I didn't expect so many of them!  They taste kind of like a beignet or chinese donut.  Towards the end, \"Susie\" warmed up to me and told me about the student 10% discount and invited me back.  I may go back to check it out with friends, but I hesitate due to the lack of options for the vegetarian.","The only reason I go here is for the posole.\nThe service is sub standard as the lady looks like she hates her job.","Love this place. I've been going there since I was a kid with my parents. I now take my child there. \n\nPrices have gone up a bit...but the food is still great. I especially like the fajitas and the asada tacos.","I went back here the other night with a friend and tried two things I never had before. The shrimp al la diabla was spicy and delicious (though I could have had about 3x the amount of shrimp), and the pozole was very flavorful. Tons of pork and good spice. My go to \"real\" Mexican joint.","Susie's is great--not the best but friendly, dingy and tasty. They try hard to be better than they are, but the proof is in the food. It's good--a little rough around the edges, but good. Strange front door...but I like it when I'm in Aridzona. Not as good as SoCal Mexican, but better than Serrano's by a mile...and Macayo's too. Now, Jordan's on Central...that's the place! But if you're over in Mesa/Tempe, Susie's is a good choice. Aloha....","Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials, they have good posole and beef tacos, and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch, throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man.\n\nLike someone else posted, you have to know what to expect.  Think a nice sit down Filibertos with bigger variety and a little more food.  and yup, the food's gonna be a little oily, but their salsa is nice and spicy :)\n\nMy buddy from El Paso loves this place cause he says the food is pretty authentic, like what his grandma would make when he is home.","Me and the Madre went here a couple of weeks ago looking for a good place to eat in Mesa... we happened upon Susie's. We entered through their crazy awesome door that was HUGE! and was seated quickly. the menu was okay looking, lots of pictures... that's kind of a turn off for me. blah. Menus with pictures *shudder* anyway, the food was drab and not worth the fuss. The decor was drap also and everything needed to be disenfected. or atleast hosed down. The wallpaper and the countless tiles are all from the 70s. I didn't hate this place, but I won't be back unless I'm promised a VERY strong margarita.","First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.\n\nHaving purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo.","The tacos here are awesome.. but what is amazing here is their sopapilla's!!!! I always get my food to go it's always ready on time and the staff is fast and efficient.","Suzie's is a cool place if you set your expectations properly. The food is decent, not overly memorable but definitely good for the price. The service is always mediocre at best ... but consistent. The atmosphere is hole in the wall / old & crusty ... but that gives it character. I'm particularly fond of Friday night's when they have a mariachi band crammed in the corner playing. Don't go out of your way for this place, but if you're in the neighborhood it's worth a stop.","i looove susie's. first off, you order a coke and it comes in the bottle, just like in mexico. second, they have plenty of totally out of skew, no perception wall murals with disporportionate people, also just  like mexico.\nthe food is good and cheap. in fact, they won best inexpensive mexican food in Get Out's eating and drinking awards","Roach alert:(\nI tried this place for the first time.  The food was pretty good and very well priced.  I was excited to know that I had found a decent Mexican restaurant close to me. \n While enjoying my taco plate with rice and beans, I forked a roach out of my rice.\nWe immediately stopped eating and called the waiter to our table.  She tried to offer me something else, but I couldn't stand the thought of my rice cooking and steaming with a roach.  We walked out and will never be back again.  \nThings happen, the place didn't look dirty.  I know roaches can be a pesky problem, but people shouldn't be finding roaches in their food.  I feel bad posting this, I mean no harm, but as someone who relies on these reviews when I decided on where to eat, I would want to know if I were you.  Anytime something like this happens, I feel obligated to let people know.  \nHopefully they can resolve their roach issue, either way, I can't go back.","I was looking for a decent Mexican food restaurant close to work and stumbled across Susie's. Similar in price to Filiberto's but the serving sizes weren't quite as big as Filiberto's is (that's fine with me; I actually prefer \"normal\" serving sizes.) Loved the soft tacos! Ate there while on lunch break so didn't get to try the 1 cent beer with lunch, but made me want to go back on a Saturday to check it out!","Checked Susie's out today with Alexander C.  Perhaps I was too absorbed with the conversation that I didn't notice the food or maybe the food itself just wasn't that special.\n\nBetween the four of us we ordered a bit of everything.  The soft tacos with lengua, cabeza and pastor were solid - would've been better with more onions and cilantro.  The green corn tamale was bone dry - it was obvious even before I put it in my mouth - the corn husk looked like it had never seen a drop of water.  My guess is that instead of steaming it to heat it up, they had just baked it or even worse, nuked it.\n\nThe best dishes seemed to be the soups - Alex's posole had the right color to it and my albondigas contained some tasty pillowy-soft meatballs.\n\nI don't think Susie's is any cheaper than most of the other Mexican joints I've been at.  In fact, El Nopalito's tacos are only 99cents.  Susie's tacos were $1.45 and up.  Mexican food is in general cheap (depending on how much decor you're willing to give up), so the deciding factor is in the taste which Susie's, unfortunately, did not especially shine at.","Worst tacos ever I felt as I was biting into the taco I was biting into an oil taco. It was all greased up I could not even taste the beef. The tortilla was dipped in oil or something it was bad.","If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susie's Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...don't forget the sour cream.   \n\nSo you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  I've never tried anything else there.  Why would you when you've found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  I'm headed out the door.....Susie's here I come!","Great hole in the wall mexican food.  mexican coke in a bottle and decent food.  Ive heard if youre a gringo you may not want to head here on dollar beer night, but the staff has always been nice and its got huge portions on the cheap.  Its your typical shredded meats, beans and veggies but its way better than Filibertos but about the same price.","One fateful day after I moved to AZ, I \"stumbled\" upon this gem (we were specifically in search of Mexican, so I supposed it's not much of a stumble). \n\nWith delicious soft tacos, salsa, beans, amazing prices (3 carne asada tacos, rice, beans for around $6 with penny beers- say what!) and a familial feel, Suzie's soon became my go-to for Mexican. Their margaritas are from a mix, the beers on tap are nothing special and the meat does not follow my \"know where your meat comes from\" philosophy, but Suzie's definitely has a soft spot in my heart and stomach!","So Ive been chatting with MJ K. for a while now.. we both have certain alignments that we instantly could relate with one another.. tacos, eating and yelping! \n\nSo we decided to meet at Susie's Cafe for a bite and some chat action. Well this is one of those places.. decent Mexican food at decent prices. Now the problem with that is that there are loads of other places that taste better and are cheaper.. this leaves Susie's it's location value. I was amazed to see so many people coming and going from this place, seems very popular with the locals. Plus if you order a lunch special, 6.95 and up, you can add a draft beer for $.01! Now that's a real bargain!\n\nThe pozole was great! Nice thick pieces of meaty pork, nice sides too, though what's up with the lemons? Also order a red chile burro and a beef taco.. the taco came sitting on lettuce, hot food and lettuce, come on! Took one bite, yeah, not so much, oily and flavorless. Now onto the burrito, acceptable. Now I haven't had any decent red chile in some time so being acceptable is a pretty good thing!\n\nWas the food enough to get me to come back.. not really, this visit was all about the conversations! I hoped this place would be better but it just wasn't. Am I saying I would go back, no, I would since they make a pretty mean bowl of posole.. I'm such a glutton for good soup!","the red hot sauce is so great here, I would tend to overlook some of the service/appearance issues noted in some of the other reviews. it is amazing to finally find home-style, no frills, no damned 'southwest' or 'tex-mex' style, basic tasty mexican food....at a very decent price! this is the kind of gem that is so easy to find in my hometown of san diego, but has proven very difficult to locate here. EXTREMELY happy to have found SUSIE'S!! we will be regular patrons..\nJust a review update, as we just ate there a few days ago again....and everything was PERFECT! Our food arrived in under 5 minutes from ordering, and it was just great. We cannot ever leave Susie's without taking home a pint of their red sauce....it's too good not to bring some home. Thanks again, Susies, for being so good!!"],"business_id":"jrZ4CdPKcXtFv_xhV8ThaA","name":"Susie's Mexican Cafe","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Try the \"Loco\" hot dogs.... 2 dogs with pico and jalapenos wrapped in bacon.... I had mayo on mine... Good stuff!!","Horrible food. Qeviche was so peppered and no other spice. Salsa has no kick and service was horrible.","Psst, hey Loco Patron, can you open a Loco by my house pleeeease. Like Queen Creek and Price. We'll be your first regulars!\n\nMy boyfriend and I go to K-Bella salon to get our hairs cut and while we wait for one another, we hang out at Loco which is in the same strip mall. The staff is really cool and they have great HH prices and pretty decent food. They also have lots of different tequilas to choose from.","Went back to Loco Patron last night.  My husband had to have the Salt and Pepper Wings!  Even though it is a 42 mile one way trip to the place.  For a Wednesday night, they had a lot of things going.  The hockey and basketball games were on TV and Wednesday nights is their poker tournament events.  There was a steady flow of people for the time we were there.  Even with all the activities our service was still GREAT!  Seth ROCKS!\n\nOk down to the good stuff - FOOD review:\n\nSalt and Pepper Wings served with carrots, celery and chipotle ranch dressing\n- The wings were fried to a golden perfection.  The wings were cooked through & through but still juicy and full of the simple balance of salt and pepper.\n\nBaked Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken breast\n- Spiral macaroni cheesed out with a creamy comb of smoked provolone and cheddar jack.  It is topped with toasted bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  The grilled chicken was still juicy not dry.  The combination of the cheese and the toasted bread crumbs was so cheesy and GOOD.\n\nHubby had the loco soft tacos with the shredded pork and told me that they tacos were just RE-DONK-U-LIOUS.  I am not sure if that is a word but OK we will go with that.\n\nNext time I need to save room for dessert.  The Sopapilla and ice cream has been calling my name.","First and last. I was there for 15 mins and i had to walk to the bar to place my order. Order 4 times a beer that never arrived. One of my lucky companions dare to order yet another beer and arrive 15 mins later... I think I never got mine. Never again!!!","We go here every Tuesday, they have the best atmosphere in Tukee.  No scottsdale kids, and dollar tacos.  This place rocks.  The hot wings burnt my butthole for 2 days, they were awesome!  I shall stumble home from you tonight!","We used to come here a lot. Now, no wonder nobody is ever there. They nickel and dime you. Tiny bowl of chips, about a quarter cup of salsa...if you need more it's $1....no matter how many in your party. If you have six people in your party you get the same amount as someone dining alone. \n\nThe real kicker was we had 3 $25 gift certificates. Our bill was $45...they don't give change and you can't use balance for a tip.  So to not lose out we only used one $25 gift card. We have to go back now. And no the gift certificates were not purchased at a discount. \n\nAnyways, bottom line we used to love this place, but this new owner had really ruined the whole concept. :(","Great food and fun on Clean Comedy night a few weeks ago.  Packed house.  A complete success.  Hope you guys do it again and again and again.","Why are there no half stars. It took an hour for the waitress to get us a beer. Horrible service. Food was ok though.","Worst service ever experienced in the Tuke.  Food decent if you ever get the server to put it in.  Ordered 2 coors lites no less than 4 times with 4 different servers- all no shows.  Horrible service - no organization. First and last time!  Waitress admitted she was new and it was bad experience- come on mgt get it together!","So glad to have a place like this nearby. It's a neighborhood hangout that has open air indoor outdoor bar area and good food. Service is slow at tables good at the bar.","Waiter: Can I get you something to drink?\nMe: Yes, I would like a Modelo Especial with a lime. \nWaiter: I'm sorry but I think we are out of limes.\nMe: Out of limes? I thought this was a Mexican Restaurant?\nWaiter: Limes coming up from Mexico are very expensive right now. \nMe: I could run across the street and pick a few limes off my neighbor's lime tree.\nWaiter: (Unimpressed)\nMe: (Unimpressed)","HORRIBLE service here. I've unfortunately been here probably a dozen times, and EVERY time I've had bad service. I've heard other people say that the only reason they are still in business is because there aren't a lot of other options around in the Foothills, especially places with patio seating. \n\nI usually have to re-order items several times, because they will tell me they're bringing my drink or food, and then it never shows up. \n\nI've even sent back drinks after they brought me the wrong drink, and they poured it into a different glass and sent it back to me?! \n\nBut credit where credit is due, their ceviche is very good. So is the salsa, the guacamole, sopapillas. Avoid the street tacos, they smell like a diaper. Most of the rest of the menu is hit and miss, even from one day to the next.","The food was bland. The atmosphere at the bar was nice with half the bar opening up to the outside. The drinks were a bit pricy but well mixed. The night life is better then most places nearby. While we have not taken advantage of it, they have a jumpy house outside for the kids on most Sundays. I would give it a try for evening drinks but do not expect much from their food.","Loco Patron has become our new neighborhood haunt.  I'm a fan of their Loco Trio.  Big portion sizes, low prices, good margaritas, and Wednesday night poker. Definitely a sports bar with a Mexican flair.","Over priced food for the amount and quality. Had shrimp tacos and the shrimp was small and tacos were skimpy. Bar tenders look right through you and the girl servers just stand around and talk to each other. It's been about a year, however, so I hope they have gotten better.","Very good spot for being so far back in Ahwatukee.  It's very casual but has a good beer selection and although the Mexican food is hit and miss, their wings are really good and Taco Tuesday is a big hit.  It's a good place to socialize with locals or go alone and read a book.  The longtime staff is also very friendly.  I recommend.","Did not honor website prices, overcharged on a la carte lunch specials, and charged extras without warnings. And every table was available at noon. Coincidence? I think NOT!!  What happened to the restaurant that was here under the same name a year ago!?!","If you're into Ahwatukee Housewives swapping and popping prescription smack on Saturday night, having your ass grabbed by a creepy divorcee old enough to be your father, weak sauce beverages and \"Mexican food\" that makes Taco Bell look appealing, then you will absolutely love Loco Patron.\n\nI also haven't been back in four years, so maybe things have changed. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot.","Patrons that go to this dive are Loco! I had expectations that night time hangouts in Ahwatukee would have at least a minimal amount of quality due to its yuppie reputation. I was so wrong on the expectations!\n\nI didn't go to LP for the food, which was lucky because nothing I saw on tables looked the least bit appetizing. This place would fail a health inspection because it's filthy!\n\nI went there to listen to a live band, and to drink and dance. That was a bad idea, although the band that played there was respectable. \n\nThe dance floor is pitiful. It's a dinky old cement floor that probably hasn't had a coat of paint for 10 years. It only shines because of the dried beer and stale grease that covers the dance floor and most of the rest of the areas. I assume people come here to watch ESPN and get drunk because it would be miserable to attempt to dance there.\n\nThe live bands get to play on an OK elevated stage that has a wood floor. The positioning of the stage would suggest that music and dance was an afterthought. Why couldn't they have used to the wood on the stage to build a floor that people could dance on? Duh!!!\n\nApparently people in the city of Ahwatukee have very low standards because this dive seems to get plenty of business.","Ive been to Loco once when it wasn't a Tuesday, but other than that I only go on Tuesday Nights... and by only, I mean every Tuesday.  My family and I go to Loco every Tuesday.  Kelsey and one other lady (im sorry I forget your name) are always our waitress.  Kelsey is awesome, I want to be friends with her! ha!  They always remember what we order.  I used to always get a margarita (one of the best frozen margaritas I have had at a restaurant) until I went on a health kick.  The atmosphere is awesome, they owners are always there checking in with people, and everyone is super friendly.  Tuesday nights are packed, luckily we get there early.  \n\nFood: I always have chicken, steak and fish tacos! Ha! I don't mess around.  Chicken tacos are $1 on Tuesdays, steak and fish are $2.  What a deal!! I have also had their wings, which are phenomenal at a Mexican restaurant! Definitely try their pretzel sticks at least once with the queso, also another fave! \n\nLoco gets loud on Tuesday, everyone is there for a good time!! This place is great for families, since its in Ahwatukee.  And the service is fantastic!  Can't speak for any other nights, but Tuesday is definitely Poppin!","I saw some older negative reviews here. They're not true now. Guys named Billy & Edward own and operate the place now. One of them always seem to be there... insuring quality service & food. Their Chips & Salsa ARE great. Their wings are huge & meaty. All employees were fantastic. A lot of TV's for sports too. Awesome / Casual hang out.","So lame. They don't have the decency to let people know on their restaurant.com ad that they no longer accept certificates, so we drove all the way there for nothing. We LOVE Mexican food, but this place lost present and future business from us. Shame on you Loco Patron.","Stopped by for some drinks at Loco Patron. The margaritas were great and brought to the table quickly.  Service was great. It was nice hanging with friends and having a drink during a wonderful February day out on the patio. I just wish the drinks were slightly cheaper.","We went to dinner at L.P. last Monday and were really disappointed. We sat ourselves, then waited for awhile before anyone came to take our order. The food was pretty good, but then after we had our check for about 15 minutes, I finally stood up and started looking for the waiter, who hadn't appeared. Another waiter asked me \"What's wrong?\" and I told him we wanted to pay and get out of there. He took the check, apologized for the wait and finally came back with change. Our original waiter seemed to have gone home. Bad service for a rather slow day. Won't go back.","Great house margarita, the pork chimi was soo good I wanted to order another one. The baja fish tacos are better than rubios fish tacos, and the come with smashed potatoes.. WOW.. Those are good. The salt n pepper wings with chipolte ranch were also amazing!! Great nieghborhood atmosphere, great patio view.","Dude -- awesome margaritas and Chips n Salsa!\n\nWe've been here a few times in our quest to find \"the best\" margarita and chips/salsa place. Last time we went it was a Sunday afternoon.  The crowd looked like they had been out drinking the night before and needed some mexican food to make their heads feel better.  \n\nLove this place -- I'd like one near my house too!!\n\nPeace Out","Yummy margaritas and nachos - slow service, salads weren't that great, soup was not good at all. Stick to margaritas and nachos and you'll be happy.","The food was terrible and salsa was the worst I ever had, very bland and boring. Overall not a pleasant experience.","Awesome happy hour!\nAnd reverse happy hour!\n\nI loved their lobster tacos... mmmm... .lobster in a taco\n\nYay!!","Crunchy fish tacos - the best in the Tuke and maybe the Valley. The burger is excellent as well. Solid sports bar.","Hello Arizona. \n\nJust flew in from Hawaii and went to this spot to have a few (a lot). \n\nService is slow. \nBUT if you go to the bar, it's on point. \nOr maybe they don't have servers. \nI dunno. None came by after dropping off the FREE salsa and chips. \nYeah. Free!!!!\nIs that a thing here in AZ? \nCuz in HI you have to pay for chips. \nI know right?! Wtf?\n\nAnyways. I'm not a margarita kinda person. But theirs is on point. \nHowever. I was ordering double Jacks on the rocks all night. Figured I would ask how much the shots were. \n$4!!!!!\n\nOh Arizona. I am gonna like it here.","Ada G. and I come here often and she's right on about the salads and the soup. I don't know why we still always order a salad (maybe someday we'll learn), but their margaritas are great, their nachos are awesome and I love their salsa - it's really fresh tasting. So fresh tasting ion fact, I once caught the toddler drinking it straight from the bowl, but hey, it's a vegetable, right? \n\nI have no idea how their \"real food\" is but their happy hour fare is delicious and cheap and that's all I ask.","Good place to grab a drink for happy hour...but that's about it. Food is an afterthought and rates somewhere in between Chipotle and On the Border.","Great outdoor seating, local vibe, decent frozen margaritas and tasty tacos.\n\nWe like to go on Taco Tuesdays with the Phoenix family as it is practically around the corner, the girls love their waitress and we love the margaritas and shrimp tacos.  \n\nForget the ground beef tacos as they are mediocre.  Chips and salsa are decent but not memorable.  \n\nIf you want REALLY good food and frozen margaritas then go to Z-Tejas.","I stand by my principle in saying Mexican restaurants have the best burger and fries. On a lovely ciabatta bun with pepper jack cheese and not cooked to shoe leather, that is how a burger should be.  Wife had the shrimp tacos and swore they were to die for.  Habanero wings? Hot. Very hot. But very good also.\n\nNow we were in on Cinco de Mayo and it was packed so I'm not gonna ding the service for that, but you could tell they seemed to be a little unprepared for all the people. Live music was good and if your into cougar hunting this seems like a nice spot to try.","It's ok. Lotsa cougars. Food is not that interesting, just Mexican bar food. Cheap tacos. Tons of kids on weekend.","We hit Loco Patron after soccer skills camp at Desert Foothills Park. Just a short walk up from the park, across the street and through the parking lot, so we we were thirsty and hungry.\n\nWe got our usual table in the middle of the bar area.  Kelly took care of us for a second time. She remembered us and treated us wonderfully!  She is an awesome server, great with our kids!  Kelly gave us a hard time and really made our night out fun.\n\nWe were able to use a check-in for drink special, but unable to use the 1/2 off appetizer (we wanted wings and wings were already their daily special). We enjoyed the atmosphere, food and plethora of TVs for the sports fans we are!\n\nOur food was served warm and delicious. We shared fajitas, fish tacos, an enchilada plate and of course, (if you've read any of our other reviews) French Fries!  Our son loves French Fries, thinks he's a connoisseur!  He rates the fries from each place, just as our daughter rates California rolls! \n\nWe had a good time, I'm sure we'll be back.","I am absolutely astounded that this \"Mexican Restaurant\" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. \n\nLets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants. \n\nYou know there is something wrong with a \"Mexican Restaurant\" when the hamburgers are better than the \"Mexican food\" they serve. Nuff said.","Could be sooooo much better. Everything just seems LAZY. From the food to the service :(","OK, this is not a hole in the wall Mexican place but it will do.  The staff is usually helpful in making recommendations.","Pretty damn good lil' joint. \n\nWe went there on Sunday @ ~ 5pm. It was not crowded at all and we got a table right away. Lil' girl came and asked what we want to drink. We shooed her away as we were not ready. But we made up our minds in a few min and she came right back to take our order for drinks. In the meanwhile chips and tasty salsa made its way to the table. By the time she came back with out Margaritas we were ready to order food and did so. \n\nWe got some soup and a Burrito Enchilada Style. Soup was properly warmed and sized and tasted good, to boot. Burrito was HUGE! Did i say HUGE? I never EVER seen gianormous burrito like this in my life, and l love Mexican food and consume quite a bit of it. So... it was HUGE! And tasted real good too. \n\nAll in all, it was good food for a fair price. I can not complain one single bit and will more then likely come back there.\n\n\"I like\"\n\"Very nice\"\n\nEugene","I went there for lunch and the food was very good. Also the people who work there are very friendly","Meh. \n\nStaff is hit or miss on the service & friendliness. Try to charge you for extra chips, etc. Food is mediocre. \n\nIt's close to me so I really wish it was my fave place ever. But I've been probably 6 times and have never left impressed.","The longer Loco has been open the better the service has gotten.  You have to ask for it, but they will bring you a green salsa that is much better than the red salsa for the chips, it has a lot more flavor.","service is slow, food is one star, place looks like a dump, pleaseeee buy some new chairs on the patio","We arrived just after 11:30am and practically had the place to ourselves. Our server was smiling and very attentive too!\n\nNice chips and salsa. Not much heat in our salsa, but full of flavor. Chips were very thin( but not weak) and fresh. \n\nWe shared the combo fajitas and fish tacos. We added extra flour tortillas & had enough fixens' to fill them all. Some a bit too full!  The fish tacos had a great sauce that went well with the fish, cabbage and corn tortillas.   The beans and rice were a bit bland, but edible. \n\nLoco Patron has Free WiFi too!\n\nWe enjoyed our visit and look forward to stopping in for happy hour food and beverage!","My parents live around the corner from here and it's a pretty regular stop for me when I'm up visiting them. \n\nI've gotten a few things on the menu and have enjoyed all of them. However my absolute favorite is the Grilled (not fried) Fish Tacos. They have the perfect amount of fish with delicious pickled cabbage and green sauce. With a corn tortilla it's perfect!! I have to admit I have not found better anywhere in Tucson...though I'm looking!\n\nOne major criticism is that their classic margarita is awful. Way to sweet. \nThis would normally be a big problem but the tacos are so good that it only takes away one star in my book.\n\nI've only gone for lunch but service has always been great! Their takeout is also wonderful. Just as good as in house!!","We were here to watch the football game with some friends.  They have happy hour drink specials even on a Saturday until 7pm, sweet!\n\n$3 Domestic and Mexican Beers\n$5 Margaritas\nDiscounted Appetizers\n\nSeth, our server was great.  Always checked in with us.  Made sure our drinks were always full.  \n\nSalsa was a little weak (no kick) and chips were good.  Got the chimi dinner in enchilada style with shredded pork, just one word WOW.  Love the minor kick of hot (I am a WIMP, so to others it is probably nothing).  The shredded pork was real good.\n\nEveryone ate their food happily, then after drinking for a couple of hours the munchies started.  We ordered the salt and pepper wings & habanero wings.  S&P wings were DAMN good.  Fried to gold perfection and the right mixture of salt and pepper on them.  Habanero wings kicks you in the lip, mouth, tongue, and fights you all the down the hatch.  If you like hot, then habanero wings are for you.  \n\nWe ordered the kings brownie explosion to top off the evening.  The warm brownies were SO GOOD.  The ice cream and whipped cream just added to the wonderfulness."],"business_id":"kvRA6hu6FC51vBKY7Kp9GQ","name":"Loco Patron","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["this place has the best fish tacos !! woo!","The salads here are very underrated!  I opt for the chicked ranch every time.  Add the homemade hot sauce with some fresh limes and wow not a bad lunch for like 6 bucks!\n\nI'm a fan!","The menu's a bit more pricier than the typical but the food is good. Star deducted because there are a lot of locations on the west side of Vegas so I only stop by if I'm visiting family on that side of town.","I think Rubios deserves a shout out! Especially because I ate there three times in a row and ordered the same exact thing every time. What was so delicious that had me addicted three days in a row...the Gourmet Shrimp Tacos! They were so good and it was even topped with bacon. The tacos had a sweet smokey flavor to them. They were cheap but didn't taste like it!","Mentioning my name in certain circles is verboten. Never mention Rex Marvin at the San Antonio Community  Quilting Bee...apparently quilting the greatest moment of your sexual history isn't appropriate for a 12 year old looking to enter the competitive world of quilting.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the National Bowling Stadium...apparently streaking across the lanes with \"This Isn't A Real Sport\" on your buttocks is a faux pas.  The beer and bratwurst crowd can be a touchy one.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the Birmingham Alabama \"Is This Your Sister or Your Wife\" Blueberry Festival...apparently screaming \"anyone who didn't take a bath with your future wife as kids aren't really married in this state\" is a little too close to the truth for most. (On a side not, moonshine, incest and the bible is a dangerous combination. A lot of bad ideas are formulated.)  And never...ever...ever mention the name of Rex Marvin at the Kentucky Apple Festival...I will just say this...when someone tells me there is an apple festival...and there is no Apple Spinach Lasagna then you get what you deserve...and if that means holding the Apple Queen down (a guy in a dress by the way)...and putting apples in every cavity...then you take it like a man...a man in a dress with shaved legs and a date that couldn't tell he was a man.\n \nIn most Mexican food restaurants...chain restaurants... there is a written rule to ban Rex Marvin on sight. They won't announce this policy...if you mention Rex Marvin they will call the cops and have you escorted out.  Only Del Taco has publicly stated on a Danish Crime Show roughly translated as \"Man Who Can't Salt Fish Correctly\" that I will be killed even if I try to go through the drive thru.  I have taken that on as a badge of all that is right in the world.  (Secretly, I go in to Del Taco's and eat their crappy food while writing 'Tom Sizemore banged your mom' on bathroom stall walls.)\n  \nI take Mexican food very seriously, because it is great when you just take great ingredients and don't mess them up. Most places use over processed crappy ingredients and used heavily handed sauces.  Fresh, simple and flavorful. Chain Mexican food restaurants seem to remove the flavor when they defrost the meat outside in the sun.  Canned vegetables. Premade sauces. Frozen food. Is there any reason that 4 of my 9 felony convictions have been committed in a fast food Mexican place? Instead of the Twinkie Defense I used the Canned Crap defense.\n \nWhen I woke up behind a Rubio's after 3 days of snorting bath salts and Pine Sol. Trust me it is something that is really best left to the professionals.  I woke up to a great smell...actually I woke up to 3 guys carrying trash cans and drinking low grade sake out of a plastic jug.  Three shots later I was ready to eat. Nice guys. Bought two Chinese stars and some fireworks.  They kept smiling and speaking Finnish...weird blonde bastards.\n \nI went into Rubios and it was a revelation. Very reasonable priced. Very good food. All of the chips are made fresh daily. The standout is the fish taco.  I have gone back several times and I have bought the battered fish tacos (I suggested calling it the Rihanna but they didn't go for it) and they were great every time. Get the Especial, very good guacamole and cilantro. Worth the 40 cents.  The Burritos are very good and a good size for the price. The salad has a lot of good things in it, not just lettuce and the blows are good if you are into that. They are light.  The taquitos are good, but not crispy enough the time I got it. The main thing is that this place uses great ingredients. The times I have eaten there I have loved the food.  Is it as good as a great local place...no, it can't be. It is still a chain, but a good chain...like the one from my scrotum to my nipple. \n\nIt does have a decent sauce bar. The three sauces range from very good to okay. They have roasted pepper sauce and the best one. There is a salsa verde, but it is the weakest one. They have a spicy piccante which is good, but one note.\n\nThe bad...the sides are not great. The beans are just awful. Very soupy. Not much flavor. The rice was dry. The sides are very important and seem like an after thought here. Sad, because it would be better rated if they cared about their side dishes. \n\nI won't eat there all the time. I won't eat there when I have better alternatives, but I will go back. I like it. I don't love it. It is how I feel about the girl who I peep into her windows. I like her enough to look...not enough to stalk. Fine line? Yes. A line nonetheless? Yes.","These are not the best fish tacos you will ever try, but they are good.\n\nAnd of you go after 2:30 on Tuesdays, the fish tacos are $1.25 each - which pretty much makes them very good.","I am a HUGE fan of Rubio's Fish Tacos with flour tortilla of course. I don't think I have had fish tacos anywhere else that was so yummy! The fish is always crispy and tender in the middle and the cabbage isn't overbearing and overstuffed. I also love the fact that Rubio's has a salsa bar that you can pick different salsas out. When I'm feeling for something a  lil healthier this is the place that I go to....although I'm not sure how deep fried anything is healthier.","I saw a special on the food network about their fish tacos so I had to try them.  Well I must say that it was love at first bite.  I can't say anything about any other menu items as I only have eyes for the fish tacos.","As a general rule, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. For some reason, it seems that the vast majority of Mexican restaurants do not offer fish tacos on their menus. That's probably because it's harder to get it right compared to a chicken or carne asada taco. Fortunately, there is Rubio's. Its whole claim to fame is the original Baja-style fish taco and as far as I'm concerned, Rubio's makes one of the best. Crispy beer-battered fish is served with shredded cabbage, mild salsa, and a tangy white sauce in a flour or soft corn tortilla. It's just as delicious as it sounds, but it tastes better if you eat it right away before the batter has a chance to get soggy. On Fish Taco Tuesdays, the original fish taco is only $1.25 after 2:30pm.\n\nWe also enjoy their carnitas rajas taco with its tender and tasty pork. My wife often orders their balsamic and roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken. Their salsa bar has 3 different salsas: mild green, spicy red, and my favorite, the chipotle. For the health conscious, they offer a grilled Mahi Mahi version which is very tasty as well. Sure there are other items on their menu, but we typically stick with our favorites.\n\nRubio's is a great choice for an inexpensive meal that tastes good. With friendly and efficient counter service and surroundings that are clean and comfortable, what more could you ask for? If you join their \"Beach Club\" email list, they will send you coupons on a regular basis, including a free meal on your birthday.","I'm a big Rubio's fan and this could well be their best location. We were served by the manager who correctly prepared our tricky order with a smile. Worth visiting for a nice lunch.","Great place to eat with friends during lunch.\n\nI've been frequenting this location for a few years and I have never been disappointed.  The wait for the food is reasonable, even when they're are exceptionally busy.\n\nThe employees are very friendly and even though we become a \"regular\" once a week, they even know what we're going to order before we can open our mouth! :)\n\nMy usuals consist of one of the following choices:\n\n- 2 Fish Tacos Plate\n- Nachos Grande w/ Grilled Chicken\n- Fish Burrito & Taco Plate\n\nAlways a good choice here.  Food is a great deal for the price!","I usually go for the garlic herb shrimp tacos- 2 taco plate. You get yourself some picante salsa, tomatillo salsa, pickled carrots and jalopenos, sit down and start eating. 2.5 seconds later when you've inhaled your food- you can thank me. swing by on tuesdays for $1.50 fish tacos (after 2PM). You're welcome.","Our morning at work consists of Getting set up and preparing for the daily business prior to opening our doors and a few other small things. But most importantly we have to all come to Agreement on what to eat for lunch.. Well today we had a tough time figuring it out but the underlying theme was Mexican. Someone shouted Chipotle, then someone shouted, \" Ugghhhhh, are you serious?\" Then From the other side of the building you hear a faint, \" Baja Fresh\", and again you hear, \" What? Are you kidding me?\" and finally someone suggested Rubios and there was a moment of silence and  the tension in the room Mellowed and the calmness of Agreement was among us. \n\nWe all put our orders down and I chose to devour a Veggie burrito. Veggie Burrito? You ask... Yep, Portabellos, peppers, beans, rice, and a nice kick to the hot salsa i had them add. Once the order arrived in our office we all headed back to the lunch table like a heard of Lions to a large................. salad..... Okay i know lions don't eat salad but just in case you are reading this as a bedtime story to your kid i did not want to say we headed to them like lions on zebra.. Moving on. The Burrito was plentiful, and they did not skimp on the portabello which i have to be honest I was expecting. This thing was stuffed like a thanksgiving burrito and was really really filling. Everyone elses food looked great and smelled great as well. I now think that this is going to be moved a little closer to the top of our lunch picks for the future feasts. \n\nIf you have not been here, and are in a hurry and like Veggies i would recommend trying out the Veggie burrito that they execute with perfection.","Work lunch take out....they deserve a 5 star for having our order ready when we arrived and for them confirming all orders were correct. We were in and out in 5 minutes. Great job Rubios!!","Excellent Fish Taco Tuesday! The fish tacos are amazing and for $1.50 each on Tuesday what a deal! I highly recommend a visit on Tuesday.","Oddly enough, this was my first time eating at a Rubio's.  I was in the area and decided to give it a try.  After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to go for the Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans instead of Black Beans ($6.29) and a Carnitas Taco ($1.69).\n\nWhile I was waiting for my meal, I went to the Salsa Bar and filled up 4 cups of their spiciest Salsa.  The food came out relatively fast.  I decided to go for the Carnitas Taco first......it kind of like the \"Street Tacos\" found in Mexico.....Corn Tortilla, Meat, Onions, Cilantro, Lime Juice.  I poured some Salsa on it and took a bite.....it was pretty good, but not great.  It's very small and in my opinion not worth $1.69.\n\nNext, I went for the Steak Burrito which came with a side of Chips.....bonus!  I took one bite of the Burrito and became a fan.  The Steak reminds me of the Carne Asada I had in So Cal growing up.  The flavor of the Burrito hit home for me.  The Salsa was pretty spicy too, so that was awesome!  The Chips weren't that good though.....good thing I didn't pay extra for that.\n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience.  Glad I found a new quick Mexican joint.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%","I use Rubios for catering through Restaurants On The Run all the time. I consistently get great quality, presentation, and the people I cater for LOVE it. Their food is always fresh and tasty, and they work hard to keep customers coming back. Highly recommend for catering!!!!","The last time before this visit that I went to a Rubio's, it was in Long Beach and they were hella rude when I asked if they could make tacos without meat.\n\nWhile vegan tacos aren't on the menu at all, this location is perfectly willing to not only meet my request, but make it just as delicious as anything else they offer. All their tortillas are dairy-free, and their corn tortillas are gluten and dairy-free, with the nutrition info made easily available on their website, and the staff is careful to make sure you don't accidentally get cheese on your order.\n\nNot too shabby for a chain. Come to Canada, please.","I live around the corner and had been wanting to stop and eat here. So I finally did. It was horrible. Paid over 35 for two average combos. The picture had a drink on the combo but at the counter they told me the drink wasn't included in the price. False advertisement.","This place is a healthy alternative to fast food Mexican food places. They have good fish tacos too. The one reason I come here is that they don't put lard in any of their food. The pinto beans and black beans are vegetarian. I would recommend this place over any other fast food Mexican restaurant.","There food is excellent for a fast food taco place. It's pretty pricey for 3-4 small shrimp on a taco (2 people $30+), but sometimes you just pay more for what you like.","I went for dinner on a Tuesday night.  I did not order the $1.50 Original Fish Tacos.  They were located on West Sahara Ave/S Ft Apache Rd in Las Vegas.\n\nI had a coupon for free chips and guacamole with the purchase of an entree.  i ordered my favorite Chipotle Shrimp Salad.  i was disappointed that there were no fresno chiles on the salad like they have at other locations.  Maybe the person making the salad forgot to put them on.\n\nI will be back!","Yeah it's another chain mexican type place but I'd say it's the best chain mexican type place out there.  I like this location for it's extra clean store and competent staff that didn't scowl, grunt, mumble or slouch while taking my order.\n\nLobster Burrito, $8.79, ugh, bad price, but great burrito, it's not all that big but it sure is tastey.","I LOVE @Rubios_BeachMex . REAL grilled steak tacos and 4 great salsa to choose from.\n\nThis visit I was redeeming my Birthday Email for a $7 Entree!!\n\nI ordered the 2 Steak Taco plate with Chips & Beans!\n\nFantastic. Friendly Service.  I had intended to take it to go but it smelled so good I had to tear into it right away.\n\nI would have given 5 stars except the nearest location is in BFE:(\n\nDon;t forget to sign up for the Beach Club to get YOUR Free Stuff!:-)","A delicious healthier version of Mexican food! Best pinto beans in town!","Tuesdays here are the JAM! After 2:30, the classic fish tacos are $1.50 each! They're great, too. And coming from SoCal, I know my fish tacos. Sure, Wahoos Fish Tacos are classic. I've been going to the original shack in HB since I was 16. And those are tasty and healthy, no disrespect. But the RUBIOS tacos are TASTIER and UNHEALTHIER... and cheaper- What's not to love?\n\nThe salsa bar is good. For some reason, the salsa bar at any local El Pollo Loco is still my favorite, but I usually question the freshness of the EPL salsa bar, although I can never turn down the guacamole salsa, even when It's 85° and I am scraping the bottom of the cilantro-cluttered bowl.\n\nBack to the fish tacos. I get them with an extra side of white sauce and extra cabbage. The fish is usually golden fried and of ample portion. Stay away from the lime, however, they are usually very potent and overpowering. Use a little salsa verde and a little chipotle salsa- Voilá!\n\nAnd I usually only get 2. Very filling, although when I feel like a fiesta I can order as many as 4 (that's pronounced 'quatro').\n\nThe staff is friendly, the girl at the Lake Mead location rides a GSXR- Whoot Whoot! And they always throw in some free corn chips. Love it.\n\nTry 'em, you'll like 'em.","ten years I think I've been going here and always yummy! People are super nice too!","This place is great!  George the shift leader was incredible. His team was friendly and happy especially since it was a half hour after closing. The music was upbeat and hip. Ill definitely be coming to this location more often. Oh yeah, and of course my food was great!","First time I went here. It was so delicious. I cannot wait to go back.","For fast food, their fish tacos and shrimp tacos combos are tasty. It comes with beans and chips. I love all their salsas too. Rubio's is my favorite Mexican fast food.","Fish taco plate is composed two tacos, a little cup of refried beans and some tortilla chips.If you also get a drink, you will have to pay almost $9.\n\nI do have to say, the fish taco was very tasty.","I wish this was closer to me. I'd eat there once a week if I could.\nObviously the fish tacos are the BEST and the Gourmet Steak taco with bacon is addicting.\nThe staff is always super nice, another manager, who has been there forever - you can tell he loves his job and Rubios!","I love everything they make. My 'must haves' would definitely be the chick/tortilla soup. The portabella taco is always good. The shrimp/mandarin salad is fabulous. Fresh brewed ice tea and the most unexpected music playing. I like it, I don't think most folks even know what they are hearing, and that makes me giggle. Hooray, Rubio's!","They have a wonderful ambiance! I really like their cleanliness and openness.  I'm grateful they are on my way from work and they are very quick and thorough.  Thanks to your wonderful staff!","Rubios is a version of a fast mex food... their specialty is \"sea\" tacos.. Tilapia, shirp, lobster tacos... their prices are very good and their food very delicious. also if you sign up online you can receive discounts and a free meal on your b-day.. \ni would recommend their combos.. half salad + any taco or their bowl..\nthe chipotle salad was amazing!!","Decent food. Had the fish tacos, good but nothing to get excited about.  Clean. Really good service.","My wife and I are hooked on your fish tacos. They are the best we have ever eaten and we have gone coast to coast and have tried some amazing fish tacos and other tasty  bites. The fish is always fresh and delicious and put in a warm fresh corn tortilla grilled to perfection makes this taco such a treat. Incredible and tasty and truly the best fish taco on this planet!!","The dining experience is more than I'd expect from a place like this. It's like I'm dinning at a 5 star restaurant-- I'm exaggerating, of course--with people coming over and asking how my food is, asking if I need anything else, taking away my plates. Can I give you a tip for god sakes? \n\nI'm always impressed when people learn my name and that definitely earns points from me. Right now, I'm obsessed with their pan seared salsa verde shrimp tacos.  You gotta try them! I have horrible cravings for those bad boys.\n\nThey also make sure you keep coming back.  One time, they messed up my order and because of it, they gave me a card that entitled me to one free taco for my inconvenience.  I wasn't even mad or upset about it, but I wasn't gunna pass up a free taco either.","Free birthday meal!? HECK YES!\n\nSooo on your bday they email you a 7 coupon for your bday, as long as you sign up for the email club prior. Now Ive been to Rubios in San Jose and really liked it! My son enjoys their classic fish tacos, and on Tuesday after 230 you can get them for 1.25 each! DEAL!! I on the other hand do not like fish, but do like shrimp, Im a weirdo lol. Anywho we ventured here after school a few days before my bday (they send the email on the first of the month) \n\nI scanned the menu for chicken and shrimp options, and asked the cashier what she recommends, her answer were the street tacos. Now I wanted to get more bang for my freebucks so I ordered the chicken burrito sans tomatoes. My son chose 2 fish tacos so my total was only 3!! SCORE!! We went to the salsa bar and got some hot salsa and FRESH cut limes!! FRESHHHHH! We always opt for water bc soda is the devil, I went ahead and squirted (dirty!) a lime into my water and enjoyed how yummy it was! \n\nWe only had a short wait and our food was BROUGHT OUT to us! WHOA! I couldve walked my little fat ace up there and when I seen him I stood up and he said no and walked it to us. Talk about hospitality! I cased my burrito and noticed it needed to be mixed up and needed more crema. I was a little afraid to ask, but he gave me a generous helping of it. YUM! So I put my crema and salsa and salted that bad boy. Now typically I do not like beans in burritos, unless theyre from Chipotle. Here the burritos taste like a more Mexican chipotle and most def make you feel fuller. The burritos are long and medium, not short and fat like Chipotle. \n\nWe both bit into our yummies and honestly I wasnt crazy about the burrito... it was kinda a fail : ( It honestly had no seasoning and was pretty bland even after all the stuff I added. I even added lime to give it a light taste, but negative! Also the tortilla dried out pretty fast bc the AC was on in there so my burrito pretty much stooped over and died mid meal. Thank goodness they give you chips otherwise Id be eating it with a fork. My son only ate 1 taco bc they also got a little soggy... we are the weirdos who take like an hour to eat, but since the ac was kickin it kinda died up our tortillas. No biggie! Cant be all grim over almost free food!!\n\nNow I give this place 4 stars bc of the customer service, as mentioned above both the cashier and food runner were very courteous. Also, my son was wandering and seen a beach ball so I asked if they sold them and the cashier gave him a FREE RUBIOS BEACHBALL! How nice right?!\n\nAll in all we'll go back to try the other yummies!!","Haven't been in for a while, but I had to get one of their new Smoky Red Chile Hand Battered Shrimp Tacos...it was really good. The sauce is sweet with a hint of heat, very nice. Had to get a Fish Taco as well, always a favorite of mine. Love their Chipotle salsa. Staff is always friendly, helpful. I think their food is worth the price, I'd rather eat here than a fast food burger joint.","Can't beat taco tuesday... $1.25 fish tacos after 2:30pm.  Good salsas.  Overall great value.","I am a huge rubios fan and prefer them over Chipotle. However rubios prices have been getting a bit too high.  They are over priced now just by a little bit.  However their food is fantastic and I love their chips and all their fresh made salsas to pick from.  Their restaurant is always very clean and comfortable to sit inside or outside.  I love their fish tacos too.  Their beans are never refried and I love their black beans too.  I wish they had a location a little closer to where I moved to but that's ok it's still worth the drive.","The grilled ono burrito is now nearly $8.00. Thats like a 25 percent increase overnight! Want cheese? .95 cents more! I couldn't believe my eyes. As the guys rang me up, I realized that with tax, a lousy burrito from an average at best fast food mexican hut was going to be over $10.00!!  I looked at the clerked and said, \" are you out of your mind?\". He just shrugged, I mean, what the f&$@ does he care, anyway? Then I promptly said, \" uh, bu bye.\" People, their food is marginal on a good day, and now everything is way too expensive. Chipotle anyone?.","This is my absolute fav place to get fresh mex in las vegas. People are always nice, food is always good, and it's cheerful and clean. Fish tacos are amazing and I never get sick of them. Bean burritos are my kids favorites. I've never had a bad meal and the price is good.","I've never had a bad experience at this Rubio's. The food is always good and they have never gotten any of my \"special requests\" wrong which is impressive.","I cannot stand inconsistency, and that is what you get here at this location. Sometimes it's great, and other times it's just not.  So, I find myself coming here less and less.\n\nPlus side the staff are very friendly.","She was a past lover. I used to visit every Tuesday.. I decided to check on her. She's changed; charged me extra this time. A whole quarter more for her \"fish taco.\" I told her: three, flour; chipotle and white sauce on the side, PLUS cilantro, AND Guac n chips. She complied, as I slipped the payment for the goods. I prepared the routine strategy. Handful of limes and four stacks of roasted chipotle sauce. No lemons. I waited for her arrival. The surprise lime embedded in every taco.. old moves, trying to play on my memories. She was different now, she changed. Yet, I still loved her. Not a bite wasted. It was done. I told myself I wasn't coming back next time; that it wasn't the same anymore. She smiled, she knew I would return, & at that very moment, I also knew."],"business_id":"ky_0S-PRZ3jldfFgzBDmsg","name":"Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["So I work right down the street from this place and I eat lunch here at least once a week.\n\nThe set up of this place is somewhat unique. When you walk in, you walk up to the counter to order your food. If you order a combo meal they give you tortilla chips and this really good hot salsa. When your food is ready they bring it out to you. \n\nI always get the same thing here: veggie burro without cheese or tomatoes, add extra cilantro. The burro is a pretty decent size and it's full of delicious pinto beans, cilantro, avocado, and onions. I can get that and a small drink for $7, which is not bad. \n\nThe staff is usually very friendly and welcoming and the place is kept pretty clean.\n\nIt is good for small-medium sized groups as there is ample seating and booths. They also have plenty of outdoor seating.","This is where my wife and kids like to go after shopping at Target.  They always order shredded beef tacos.\n\nI like their chips and salsa.  It's the perfect amount of heat for me.\n\nTheir dining room and bathrooms are always kept clean.  \n\nTheir staff provides a pretty good level of customer service.","The Barracho Burro is amazing!  Also, if you love Pollo Fundido then you absolutely must try theirs.  \n\nThey give unlimited chips and their own unique salsa.\n\nIt's not really greasy and \"unhealthy feeling\" the way some fast-food mexican food can be.  You get large portions with high quality ingredients that taste amazing.  \n\nI moved out of state but if I come back I'm here for nearly 2 meals a day, no joke.","Call it non-authentic, chained-out, garbage Mexican food, Someburros it is what it is. And I actually really enjoy the place. \n\nMy \"Mom in Law\"  frequently orders Someburros party platters of their mini chimis, flautas, burros, etc. for our annual family Christmas Eve gathering, graduation parties, you name it. For what this place is, that's always been exceptionally delicious. \n\nI especially love their chips and that amazing hot sauce that goes good on anything! \n\nAfter spending most of the afternoon volunteering (and didn't do our weekly grocery shopping yet, whoops), Dude and I decided to get dinner before attempting to walk into a grocery store HANGRY!  \n\nThis location is always very clean, has friendly counter service. And the chips are free, boom!\n\nDecided to venture off into the deep end having not had much else other than the party platter. \n\nOrdered that famous Pollo Fundido several of my Yelp friends (and many other) have raved about. \n\nMarinated chunks of chicken breast wrapped in a flour tortilla, then deep fried and smothered in jalapeño cream cheese, grated cheddar and green onion. \n\nDude had the Rod Burro, filled with green and red chili beef, refried beans, chorizo, and capped off with both red and green enchilada sauces and melted cheese. \n\nAll of this came out to just over $15 with two drinks. \n\nSo maybe they were having an off night, but I'm sad to say, the Pollo Fundido sucked. To call that mess atop the burro \"cream cheese\" is not only a lie, but an insult to real cream cheese because it had the consistency and taste of runny sour cream and no jalapeño taste whatsoever. \n\nI was super bummed after rave reviews of this! The chicken was also extremely dried out, but the hot sauce managed to save it. \n\nThe Rod Burro; however, was delicious and I had total plate envy. Was it knock your socks off delicious? Definitely not. But Dude enjoyed it, which was great . . . Given how spoiled we are by his Nana's Sonoran Cooking. \n\nNext time I want fast Mexican food and want to blow 700+ calories and over 35 grams of fat in a single sitting, I'm just going to Qdoba and getting a Chicken Burrito with that heavenly 3-cheese Queso and some habanero salsa. MMM MMM MMM! \n\nWill I still come to Someburros? You betcha! Their combo plates and chimis are pretty good. \n\nThere's something for everyone here. Check it out for a fast, affordable meal, or if you're hosting a party!","all around solid mexcan food restaurant. if you're looking for authentic though I'd look somewhere else this is Caucasian style mexican food.","I actually like this place, but today my experience was not good... why?\nwell I can't believe the price of their \"bean and cheese\" is actually more than a beef one? ... on top the beans they added was probably equivalent to a scoop.. mostly toritlla.. what a rip off!  Once again, I do enjoy their food but I better find me a more reasonably priced place.. or one that actually serves what you pay for..","Not that great but just ok. The spiccy beef burro was good....thought the beef taste different from other beef o eat....maybe it is donkey meat. Not a bad environment and friendly staff. \nThem my tummy hurt bad after ten minutes of eating....maybe it was food i aye earlier or maybe not. So if it taste funny...then throw it away.","Quick, easy, and tasty Mexican food.  I ordered a kids meal cause I wanted a churro (it was not good ha) and also a smothered burrito.  The tortilla was really good, tasted fresh and homemade.  Not sure if it was though.  And the chile was great.  \n\nBusy on Sunday after church so we had to stalk other tables and sit down right when they stood up.  \n\nPretty hot inside, but It's AZ...what do I expect right?","Someburros has amazing chorizo, enchiladas, chimichangas, salads, churros, and pretty much anything else you'd want. I love their original Tempe restaurant, and the Chandler restaurant is just as good.\n\nThe staff is great and the place is clean and inviting. I couldn't love it more (I come almost once a week.)","Ordered pollo fundido.. it was unedible.  Cut into the burrito and water drained out leaving the burro in a puddle.  Chicken appeared canned.  Hot sauce is good.  Posting a pic to show how the chicken looks.","Awesome place to eat lunch, food is good quality and the breakfast burrito's are great. Gets busy during lunch time but if the weather is nice you can always sit outside. Staff is friendly and you don't have to wait too long for them to bring you your food. Overall good place to eat","I like Someburros.  It's nothing fancy but they have good mexican food and quick service.  The red sauce is tasty.  I would't really travel out of my way to get here, but if I want mexican and I am near by I head in.\n\nThey have much better parking at this location than the one on baseline.","This is a typical weekend stop for the family.  I didn't like it much when we first started going but the place has really grown on me.  It is always clean, the kids working there are friendly, it is fast and the prices are good.  \n\nMy wife always gets a veggie burro that comes with what most places call pico but they call chunky salsa.  Their pico comes with avacod so we always grab a cup of that.  The kids eat rice and beans with the chips and also and always enjoy it.  Their regular salsa is more like a hot sauce.\n\nI rotate through several dishes, the rod burro (probably my fav), the poncho villa, crudo, burracho burro.  All are good.  I don't care for the carna asada burro  - it comes with rice inside and I don't care for that.  The carne asada taco plate is great with some pico or guac.  The pollo fundido is good but not a flavorful as the other burros.\n\nplain and sweetened iced teas are fresh brewed and good (at least the plain tea is I never drink sweet tea).","always a good choice for fast, yummy food!","A negative review of Someburro's can only come from the mind of the clinically insane.  Their food is always superb, but most importanly, it's consistent.  It's impossible for me to eat here less than twice a month, so I must maintain an intense workout regimen to offset the calorie onslaught.  I would drink the hot sauce by the gallon if not for fear of liquefying my gastrointestinal system. Having a rough day? A Pollo Fundido or Rod Burro can turn just about anyone's frown upside down in a hurry. The owners have carefully and slowly grown the brand, careful not to compromise quality or consistency.  Bravo for your many years of excellent restaurateuring!","They have really good chips and salsa. The crudo burro was spicy but not too spicy where it takes the flavor of the food.  The carne Asda tacos were ok, nothin to special. The beans were not too good however the rice was tasty.","I've been eating at Someburros since the early 90's in Tempe.  It has been great to see them open up more facilities in SE valley.. The big plus is the fact that their food is consistently delicious on all 4 sites.. My favorite is the Beef Chimi with Red Sauce.. You can't go wrong.. Oh, how can I forget.. Their chips and sauce are very addicting..","I ordered food for 40 people this past weekend and when I got there to pick it up I was shocked to see how small little there was. This was not going to feed 40! The manager told me that their serving sizes are based on what they presume a person eats, which is (1) serving size... What?!  You mean most people don't serve themselves twice?? I know I do. I ordered Chile Verde and it did not look like Chile \"Verde\" it was a brown ugly color and not green???  All the food was Waaaaaay too salty and I was very embarrassed by it!!  I will Never order from Somburros Ever again!!!","The red chili burro is fantastic. Every time. Sometimes this Some Burros takes fooooorrreeevvvveerr to get you your food though. At least, far longer than semi-fast food Mexican should take. It's been more than once. Just sayin.","Tried this Someburros for the first time tonight. Excellent as usual. This is some of the best Mexican fast food you can get. And they make excellent hot sauce!!!","The Pollo Fundido is outrageously good.  Light and flaky shell, well seasoned chicken...spot on all around.  I also occasionally will pop in just to get a taco or two if I need to take care of a crunch fix.  Great salsa and I love that it's authentic Sonoran Mexican food without having to commit to a sit down restaurant.  I do have a little hole in the wall Sonoran Mexican joint that's been in Phoenix for 40 years that is slightly better (if not just because of childhood nostalgia), but to cover my bases all over the rest of the Phoenix Rural/Metro area, Someburros gets my vote.","I never have a problem finding something good to eat at Someburros.  Some of my favorite items to eat here are the tacos.  The shell is perfectly crispy, with juicy shredded chicken (or beef), and even better when you put the hot sauce/salsa on it.  Another favorite is the rod burro, which is a huge burrito filled with chorizo and beef enchilada style.  In addition to tasty eats, they have refreshing horchata to go with your meal.","Came here w/ the hubster's. I've actually been craving this for some time now. The pollo fundido is great! So goooooood! Its a pretty big portion. The rest of the food looks really fresh too. The best part is that they have churros! \n\nGreat prices and food!","The customer service at this location was excellent. The cashiers and server were very nice and helpful. \n\nThe problem is they cook almost everything in lard and don't seem big on sharing that with customers. We discovered this after asking a few employees, and we were happy that they helped us find something that wasn't cooked in lard. Unfortunately, it ended up being a cold chicken salad with no seasoning, but the customer service was still great.","We love Someburros!  I have been going to their restaurants for 25 years.  This location is newer and nicer then the Tempe location by far.   You order at the counter and they bring your meal to you.\n\nThe food is not greasy for Mexican food, it comes quickly, is warm, and delicious!  The food is also cheap,  They give you a ton of chips while you wait, and they will refill them at the counter if you ask.\n\nI like the bean burro a la carte, but everything here is good.  They also serve beer too if you want.\n\nTry their party platters, they are reasonably priced and great for football season.  They also can be picked up a few hours after ordering.  Also try their Xmas tamales.","Not bad... really!","Nothing Special.  Just another ok Mexican place in Arizona.  Blah","If by burrito you mean a large corn tortilla taco then I guess some burritos are not created equally. Terrible and bland taste, nothing like what I expected. I probably should have read some reviews before ordering. Everything including salsa costs extra... I literally walked out without eating.","Its Sat night, and we have ran around all day and the last thing I wanted to do was cook some dinner, so I asked my son and daughter what do they want for dinner and they just looked at me with the deer in the headlight look, so I knew it was up to me to find the place.\n\nI remembered that Some Burros was next to the Chandler Mall, now I have had Some Burros before, use to work near by the one on baseline & mill & sometimes work has them cater events, and once the thought Some Burros got into my head I was craving their hot sauce, have you tried it yet? Omg it's a good hot sauce, goes perfectly with chips and food.\n\nSo I told them that's where I am headed, so off we went. My daughter ordered 2 beef tamales with red sauce & beans & rice, my son had the carne asada burro with beans & rice and they both liked their dish, my son even said he will go back, and that's a big deal because he is a picky teenager haha\n\nI had the pollo fundino, the chunks of chicken were very tender, the flour tortilla was fried perfectly, not too hard & not to soft, oh but that jalapeno cream cheese is to die for! Love that stuff!! \n\nIt was the perfect dinner for a sat night!","Always good lunch. But dont forget them for breakfast burros. I find there food is good american mexican.","I always visit this place every time I'm back home from school. The food is very tasty and the restaurant is clean. I usually order shredded beef tacos or the shredded beef chimichanga, and I am usually always very pleased. The only slight con about this place is that their prices are quite a bit higher than more Mexican restaurants that are a bit more authentic.","This place is a bit different than the one in Tempe.\nThey have on the menu Hot Tea, but when we asked the girl for Tea she said, we don't have that! But, it is on the menu, she said, it is???\nTheir  menu is up on the wall.\nSo then we said, ok how about coffee? (also on the menu)  She said, well, we have to make it.\nOK never mind.\nOther than that the food is very good, the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is nice and clean.\nit is worth the visit, their salsa is great!","Tasty, fast service, clean restaurant.  Gets a little crazy with the kids sometimes, but they cater to families, so what can you expect?  Shredded beef tacos and pollo fundido are great!  Really like the beans and rice (rice is moist and flavorful).","The food was OK. Finding a scorpion burned on a chip, kind of made me loss my appetite","Every time I go for lunch the restaurant is spotless. They must have a designated cleaning staff. A family of four can easily eat well for about $30. The food is always well prepared. Never had a bad meal. Very much traditional Mexican fare.","Someburros was the official restaurant of choice of the elementary school I taught at in Chandler. With good reason. The bean and chicken burrito will change your life.","We eat here about every 10 days.  Always for dinner (when it's my night to cook).  Food is good - to - real good.  \n\nService is way above average because the girl that buses the tables and my family now know each other on sight.  It's that personal relationship that makes it all good.  Next visit I am going to learn her name.\n\nPrice is good for the quality and the amount of food we get.\n\nSee you again in about 10 days...","So, on the spectrum of Taco Bell to Baja Fresh, this was a small step up from Taco Bell. I decide I want to try to get something slightly healthy and start looking at the salads; maybe that was my first mistake. I asked about the Chicken and Avocado salad. The young girl behind the counter said there were beans on the salad. When I asked if they were black or pinto, she said, \"I think they are kinda like pinto.\" Telling me that she really doesn't know the difference . . . maybe something they should cover in training. Side note, the salad did not have beans on it. Something else they might want to cover in training.\n\nThen I asked about the picante salad dressing. The response was a sweet/hot dressing. When the salad arrived, I would have called it PACE Picante. I don't mind PACE, but lets be honest about what is being served.\n\nThe chips that they gave me while I was waiting were a little over done, however the hot sauce in the squeeze bottle was pretty good.\n\nNow, some my say it is my own fault for ordering a salad at a place like this, however I think there are plenty of Mexican Food restaurants that have delicious salads, Baja Fresh being one of them. So, if you are looking for a salad, don't go here. If you want a 5 lb burrito to make you sluggish for the rest of the day, maybe it will be good - I wouldn't know. Either way, I won't be going back. Honestly, I'd rather go to Taco Bell.","This is another place on my regular lunch rotation.  I have been eating at Someburros for years frequenting the locations in Tempe and Gilbert as well as this location by Chandler Mall\n\nThis is deli style.  You go to the counter and order, they give you a number, and then bring the food to your table.  The restaurant is always clean and well staffed.\n\nThe food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley, but it is fast and inexpensive.   Most adult meals with drink will cost about $8.  Kids cost 1/2 that.  \n\nI usually get one of the burritos.  Lately the Crudo Burro is my favorite.  It is shredded beef with SPICY tomatillo sauce.  Do not order this unless you can handle spicy food.  I also like the Rod Burro and the Poncho Villa.  I really like the rice, as well.  \n\nSomeburros also has large party platters.  A number of times we have purchased party platters for a gathering at our house.  Our guests always devour the food and rave about it.  It is a relatively inexpensive way to cater a party.\n\nSomeburros is a great place for lunch and a relatively inexpensive way to feed the family.  If you have not tried it, definitely check it out.","Usually love this place. But tonight I tried ordering to go and the guy Daniel kept fighting me on the menu and that I was ordering wrong. I have been ordering the same thing since it first opened. I know what it is and what it comes with. He was arguing  with me. So of course I hung up. I called again 10 min later to try again and maybe get someone else and he was still fighting me on it. I hung up because at this point I am furious. I am calling tonight to talk to a manager because customer service is #1 to me and he made it horrible. I love this place but his fighting me is making me not want to go there for awhile.","With all the good Mexican food in the area, I am surprised this place stays in business. I mean seriously, I can't think of Mexican place that is worse than Some burros. The salsa taste like watered down ketchup with salt pepper and a little spice. My sons cheese quesadilla was scant on the cheese  my carne asada burro was dry and not flavorful at all. \n\nI am usually not this harsh, but I have been here and twice and have been underwhelmed both times.","Ordered two different chimis.  Red beef and machca.\n\nThe red beef was ok.  Although be ready to taste it again in a few hours.  The machca beef was more shredded beef (not a bad thing) than machca.\n\nOn the menu both come enchilada style which, quite frankly, is something I don't get.  So we passed on that.  Otherwise it was served with melted cheese ( kind of a weird texture/constancy), sour cream and guacamole.  Sour cream was sour cream.  Guacamole was ok, although the avocados could have been mashed a little more.\n\nChips were good but I found the salsa to be a little hotter than I prefer.\n\nOverall not bad.","I live no where near a Some Burros....and it is probably a good thing...because I would go there way too often!  They are quick, cheap and have some of the best beans out there.  I also have major cravings for the Boracho Burro, which is a green chile beef burro smothered with more sauce and topped with sour cream and guacamole.  \n\nI love this place so much I sometimes make up excuses to go to Chandler Fashion Center just so I can eat here!  I sometimes grab takeout if I am in the area for work and bring it back to my office.  They lose a star for not giving you free chips with take-out orders...but other than that...for \"fast food\" they are excellent!"],"business_id":"lDaRjBglhfWCRMMYbXDMNg","name":"Some Burros","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Awesome, new 2nd location of my favorite taco shop in Las Vegas.\nNot much more to say than I've said in my 5-star review of their original location - I refer to this place again and again as my benchmark for street tacos and nachos.\nService is professional and friendly, and their fresh-made salsas are spectacular.\nIf you've got your favorite LA taco spot, you will be more than happy with this one.\nKeep it up guys!","Note: I'm an east coaster. I'm no taco pro. But these guys are awesome and the $5.99 lunch special is rad. 4 'cos (carnitas, pastor, pollo, chorizo), rice, beans, soda, bawse. The rice is bleh (but who needs it) and the pollo taco is bleh (isn't every?), but every other 'co was legit. 3-4 bites each in corn tortillas, they were sized perfectly.\n\nThe salsa's are solid, too. Reading previous reviews, I knew to ask for them at the window but didn't expect four different kinds to be tossed in the bag. Each different in consistency and spice level, it was fun to mix and match. \n\nThis place crushes Roberto's (minus the breakfast burrito) and I can't wait to get back here (tomorrow). Bonus: it's right next to a taco bell (sorry TBell).","I've been looking forward to trying this place since it opened....sadly I was not pleased. The lady at the cashier was so nice but that's about all I have to say for nice things. The tamale was small, and just eh tasting. Tacos were alright. The enchilada....was not an enchilada at all. No meat, flat, and almost like a quesadilla with enchilada sauce on it. Honestly, Frank and Phina's Caucina and Roberto's has bigger, real portions and prices are good!","Love my 4 tacos, rice, beans, and pop for $5.99...Best lunch deal in Vegas! The pastor is soooo good! I always want to try a burrito or torta or something, but can never stray away from the lunch special!","One day several months ago I was trying to find a good taco shop close to work. With the courtesy of Yelp, I found the Tacos La Mexicana restaurant, so my friends and I decided to give it a try. Here's what I thought:\n\nTHE DECOR (3 out of 5)\nNothing too special here as you would expect from any other taco shop in a little strip center. There are a limited number of tables here, but it usually isn't too much of a problem finding a place to sit after you've placed your order. The good part is that they do keep the dining area clean, and they have a couple of flat screen TVs to watch to pass the time.\n\nTHE FOOD (4 out of 5)\nNow, the food is the best part. I usually order the 4 taco lunch special which includes 4 tacos, beans, rice and a drink. With the tacos you just need to let them know what kind of meat that you want from Al Pastor, Chorizo, Carnitas, etc. The tacos taste fresh and are definitely delicious. The little salsa bar that they have setup on a small table may be a little lacking but at least they have the usual suspects with a couple of different salsas, carrots, jalapeños, and radishes.\n\nTHE PRICE (5 out of 5)\nSo, the lunch special that I usually get is just $5.99 plus tax! So you won't be breaking the bank when eating at this restaurant. \n\nOVERALL (4 out of 5)\nSo, if you're on the west side of town and feel a hankering for some good but cheap eats, you should definitely give Tacos La Mexicana a try!","Authentic mexican food. Get it made your way. Hard tacos & Calientê picante salsa. Smells sooo good and is located next to a Taco Bell lpl.  Very nice service. Made to order. Only $1.99 for hard tacos beef or chicken, and real shredded cheese. They werent tight on the salsa either. I had it to go they incl. limes napkins without me asking. Sooo yummy. Ill def. be back.","Awesome I only do the lunch special always, cause the deal is great, one time the rice was kind of nasty tasting, but I gave it another try. And ever since then I am In love. I still want to try other things but I love tacos, (no cilantro) I grew up in Mexico and these are great tacos","I read a lot of positive reviews about this place and had to try it out for myself. I came and got a lunch special and I have been going back ever since. I'm tired of the Roberto commercials talking about real authentic Mexican food, Roberto's has nothing on Tacos la Mexicana.","love it! delicious!!!!!!!  if you are looking for excellent mexican food, this is the place to come...","Looking for a reasonably priced, fast and exceptional Mexican spot? This place is it! Roberto's has nothing on this place. Cleanliness and appearance alone beats them. Friendly workers and it also has a drive thru for the lazy pajama cravings;) Definitely my new spot for super burritos!","Really good and the only complaint was my carne asada buritto was full of rice and beans yuck!!!! i couldnt taste the meat over these flavors it tasted like what i call a white burrito lol i know next time but theyre food is great all in all from the other things i have ordered try it out theyre great","Decent tacos and super cheap too, especially if you come during lunch (before 3 pm) for their lunch special where you get 4 tacos, rice, beans and drink for $5.99. If you come after 3 pm, you pay the same price and just don't get a drink. They also have several other specials on the menu and the same policy applies. \n\nThe chorizo is my favorite so far. The tacos seemed smaller than other places but the meats are tasty although sometimes slightly greasy. The horchata tasted watered down so just opt for a soda.","Popped in for a couple breakfast burritos with the wifey this morning. Good sized burritos with plenty of eggs, taters & bacon inside. The tortillas were cooked perfectly, where they're slightly golden brown & crispy.\n\nMy only complaint was the burritos seemed a little dry... A lil' sour cream on the inside would compliment them nicely.","Me and a friend stopped by to pick up some dinner to go. The lady at the register, Diana, was so nice. She took time out of her day to describe some of the foods that we had questions about. Super nice staff, friendly and makes you feel like you are a part of the family. The food is so good and flavorful. Will keep going back again and again!!","I love the carne asada huaraches they are the best!!! It's a gigantic tortilla filled with black beans topped with meat,cheese, onion  and salsa verde. They take a long time But its worth it. The service is always good.","Pretty tasty chicken nachos!  Beats Roberto's by a landslide.  Glad I found this quick lil yummy Mexican place nearby.  Thanks fellow yelpers!","Best tacos in town PERIOD!!!","I needed a street taco fix so we drove cross town to and decided to share a 4-taco platter that included beans and Spanish rice.  My wife chose 2 with al pastor while I settled on a pastor and a chorizo.  All were authentic (that's good), but the chorizo made my taste buds do the Shimmy, Shimmy Shake.","We always see this lil restaurant when we pay a visit over to CJ's next door but I only remember it from the days of the original owners of BeeGees :(\n\nAnyway, we were craving some Mexican food so we decided to give them a try. When we walked in, there weren't very many customers so we were kind of weary at this point about continuing with our little adventure, but we proceeded on and ordered our food.\n\nI ordered a plate that had 1 tamale and 1 chile relleno w/ beans and rice. I'm not asking to blow me out of the water, but the flavor on my entire plate was non-existent :(\n\nHonestly, I'm no health inspector but I am pretty sure that the hot sauce containers have to completely be in ice, not just the bottom portion of it... AND there has to be the usual sneeze guards or at least covers not just random containers on a table in front of the bathroom?\n\nStaff was uber nice but-- I'm sorry, not returning.","Had the Carne Tacos. It was pretty good. Their beef had some seasoning to it so it wasn't bland.  The service was nice and there's a self serve salsa table, which I love.","If you want best bang for you money and good Mexican foods, go somewhere else. First time ordering carne asada fries here and was very disappointed. They gave me half of what other shops are giving in their orders and charged the same price as other places around town. Wouldn't come back here again","I ordered the rolled tacos combination with beef, they were just ok.  The beans were really runny and did not have much flavor and the rice was pretty standard.  I will try again to see if this was just an off day.  The service was great though!","I really like this place! I like it better than  Roberto's Got 4 astada Tacos, beans and lettuce with tomatoes.  I think they just threw the lettuce and tomatoes on my plate, because I was suppose to get rice (I love rice, any kind of rice)  She told me as soon as the rice is ready she will bring it to me.  I love the condiment table, ohhhhh the pickled jalapenos.  I really liked the tacos!  the beans.......Well they could have kept that.  The lettuce and tomatoes, not sure how all that was suppose to be tied in with the rest of the meal, but what ever.....My rice never came.  \nSo I decided when I get off work, I will come back here so I can bring a plate home to my husband.  So  I just told the cashier, that I will pick up my rice when I get off work.  \n\nI go back after work.  They already knew what the deal is!  That's pretty good service.  I ordered the same thing for my husband that I go for myself for lunch.  Tthey also gave me a free soda for my troubles.   So when I got home, and opened his plate!  WTF, I didn't get chips!  And he didn't get lettuce and tomatoes!  The chips were so good!  And the rice was the BOMB.COM!  They gave me a pint  and I ate the whole thing!  Next time, they can keep the beans, give me chips and rice!","Wow. How lucky it is that I've found this place. I hate to cook so I always eat out, and by always, I mean two meals a day. I've been going around different restaurants for months that fit my budget and I would pay around $10 ~ $15 for a decent meal at a decent restaurant. Then I came here. I ordered a lunch special for $6.43. I expected a paltry amount but no, I was quite full and the food was delicious! And the food wasn't watered-down Americanized food; it was genuine Mexican food. Since then, I've been coming here EVERYDAY (literally). I don't know how they are able run their business, serving such high quality food while charging so little. I almost fear that they might go out of business. I feel obligated to leave this five-star review because I want them to have a lot of customers. I absolutely love the place. Highly recommended.","Yummmmy!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis place is amazing!!! Real authentic drive thru mexican food!!! Omg! the best.\n\nI was a little sad at first cause their menu showed no vegetarian option so I asked for a specific burrito without meat, the worker then told me they do in fact have a delicious vegetarian burrito.  My suggestion to them would be to put it on the menu. \n\nOther then that this place is my go to fast mexican food.","I've been a fan of the original Tacos La Mexicana on Decatur and Twain for some time. So, I'm thrilled that they brought all that taco goodness closer to my neck of the woods with their second location near Durango and Spring Mountain. The carnitas tacos are just as good as the ones at the original spot. The quality and flavor of the asada are better than almost any taco shop on the west side of town and the al pastor wasn't bad either. Tacos are pretty cheap at $1.39 each. The chicken tamale ($1.75) was pretty good, but the carnitas is what you should load up on.","I've seen this place on Durango for a long time and finally decided to try it.  I hit the drive thru with one car in front of me.  I ordered the cheese enchilada combo and a large diet coke.  The car in front of me waited at the window for about 10 minutes before receiving their order of one to-go container.  I drove up and the gentleman at the window apologized for the wait and took my money.  I waited at least another 7 or 8 minutes for them to finally get my order.  I then had to ask for my drink and some hot sauce as none was offered.\n\nNow I sit at my computer at work with my order......that is wrong!  They gave me chicken enchiladas instead of the cheese.  In fact there was almost no cheese anywhere on or in these enchiladas!  There was almost no sauce on them either.  They were practically dry!\n\nOverall, a pretty bad experience from slow service to getting the wrong food that was not very good.  Next time, I will go to the usual Robertos.","Not very good anymore just flavorless and kinda gross I don't know what happened the torta was really bland and dry my rolled tacos were just not good :-( I use to really like this place","Great service and fast you get that these days. The drive thru is quick and they have a nice light menu so you won't be struggling on reading the menu. The employees are very nice and they know menu really good. I will be back when ever I want authentic Mexican food","Good place for Mexican food. And it's very affordable. Roberto's is shit next to this place. Their salsas are actually salsa, not water down crap lol try it and enjoy the food.","Don't let the 4 versus 5 stars fool you, the food here is delicious, and everyone is warm and friendly, even to a very pale American girl who never had real Mexican food until she moved to Las Vegas\n\nI judge Mexican food by the Carnitas, something I had for the first time about 4 years ago.  The carnitas here is delicious, but occasionally a bit too greasy.The carne asada has good flavor, also, and I enjoyed the pork tamale, huarache, and the rolled tacos.  The green salsa is absolutely too die for delicious.\n\nI stop in once a week or more, and get treated like a welcome friend every time, and that keeps me coming back even more.  If you haven't tried it yet, stop in for lunch and try one of the lunch specials. You can even go through the drive-thru and take it with you!","I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was garbage! The carne asada tasted bad, thin and hard, just bad quality. Roberto's is not that great but it's better than this place","Decently priced Mexican food. The carnitas torta is amazing!  Kinda far from my house though. Tried the torta at Roberto's and it's just not the same...at all. Oh well, the drive is worth it!","This is going to be our new go to spot for mexican food. Its a brand new hidden treasure two blocks away from our house.\n\nRoberto's is crap food and very expensive. They nickle and dime you so I really wanted to find a new mexican place that taste authentic. especially since our favorite restaurant chappala's closed last year.\n\nWalking in the place was packed, no where to sit.. which in my eyes is a very good sign. there arent a lot of places to sit, maybe 5 tables but every chair was taken and people were chowing down.\n\nOnce we started looking at the menu a gentlemen walked out from behind the counter and handed us a menu. He mentioned we could always call ahead and then go through their drive thru for pick up. Wait, drive thru!? Thats a star in itself because theres somedays I just want my mexican food but dont want to get out of my pjs or put any makeup on. \n\nI noticed they are significantly lower than other places around here which is great. Here are the prices of some of the items we ordered. 4 rolled tacos (chicken) combinations plate (included guac, lettuce, sour cream and cheese) 6.95. Chicken hard tacos (fully loaded!! and huge! Completely worth it) 1.99. Small horchata 1.50. Pork tamale 1.99 Cheese quesadilla (made with the mexican cheese and super huge!) Asada burrito (beans, rice, cheese, onions, and meat) 4.99.\n\nAll of the above were delicious. I think the tamale could have had a bit more flavor but   I may just be spoiled from having cook them myself all the time.  Everything was in great portion. We have leftovers actually. Half the quesadilla, two chicken tacos and two rolled tacos, rice and beans. It came to 17 but next time im sure we will spend less.. our eyes were bigger than our stomach.  \n\nThe customer service was great and everyone was friendly and welcoming. they had no problem explaining what was in every burrito or mentioning what their biggest items sold are.\n\nThey had a salsa bar with lots of items and their salsa was delicious and fresh.\n\nI really liked that they didnt charge to use our debit card, like robertos does.\n\nwould have taken more pictures of the food, but we inhaled it but i take that as a positive note :)","Tacos de carne asada were very good, carnitas was very good as well but the al pastor was lacking in flavor. I liked the orange'ish salsa they had to go on the tacos and my son liked the rice as well.\n\nOne of my complaints with this type of place is always having the TV blasting Mexican soap operas while I'm trying to eat. Give it a rest.","Went here again, and the food was still good in respect to taste, portion, and seasoning. Ordered a supreme burrito.\n\nWhat changed that I disliked was that the sauces and jalepenos weren't readily available on that one middle table against the wall, and when I asked for jalepenos, they took it out of the freezer in the back of the kitchen and handed it to me directly.\n\nThe big deal about the jalepenos is that they are less spicy this way. In fact, boiling them makes them spicier. This might not be as big to other people, but when I order spicy food, especially if it's Mexican food, I expect a lot of spiciness.","This particular location have change owners like 4 times in the past year. they recently opened Tacos La mexicana and I really liked it. the portions and prices are pretty good. I tried the burrito with the flan and it was delicious. to give you a better idea of this place is like going to Robertos, but a bit more scale (not too much, just a bit)\nTip: do not miss their lunch special, 2 tacos, rice & bean + soda for 6 bucks!!","Great Mexican foods with many different seasonings and large portions.","Opening day free food! Thank you. Cheese quesadilla was excellent. Daughter enjoyed the french fries. Tried the red salsa and the brown salsa. The brown was pretty good and the red was excellent. Chips were okay, but I tend to like a thinner chip. Restaurant was bright and clean, service was fast and cheerful and the overall quality of food was great. I will go back.","I had the urge for tacos but wanted too try something different then my normal spot. So thought too myself is there better time too check out Tacos La Mexicana! I remember back when it use too be japanese restaurant and always been curious too check it out. I heard lot of positive reviews for it. My first impression walked in was floor space itself nothing changed and there still bamboo plants that use for decoration. Really that when the similarity ends. Inside they changed the color, added big sombrero on the wall, the menu has a nice diversity (but not too big), and drinks have your horchata, mexican soda (love that old school soda in glass bottle) and old school coke glass bottle. Small place laid back atmosphere plus if on the go they even have drive thru window.\n\nI always been fan of authentic tacos none of this american fast food tacos. Between taco trucks and authentic places like Tacos La Mexicana nice option. Lengua guy through and through. No exception got two lengua and two carne asadas tacos. I had too get some refried beans just cause. It like having peanuts and beer. One compliments the other. Both tacos were awesome! I like the portion size of meat they give you per tacos. Both cooked perfect, nice moist, hot, tasty, and hit it with one of five different salsas. Delicious! I almost got in all five. The salsa verde, salsa roja, and regular salsa. You can tell they were freshly made each day. Although the way they ice it down had its own personality. I think the fact that they have FIVE different salsa all daily fresh made, along with your pickled jalapenos/carrots. By far best salsa bar or station had in town yet! The refried beans were pretty tasty too. I just came Big fab of Tacos La Mexicana.\n\nThe lunch specials talk about STEAL of deal. Four tacos any choice PLUS you get rice and beans plus drink. It not that much more for dinner but ordering tacos at dinner that all you get. So lunch better bargain but still lunch of dinner great value great food. Plus five different salsas not as though same tacos every time. I know Tacos La Mexicana is place that plan on stopping by more often.","Authentic food, but they messed up my order and over charged us.","A fine Mexican joint with good food, good prices, and a slightly hole in the wall interior.\nThey use Mexican cheese instead of jack or mozarella which gives their quesadilla and beans with cheese a delicious, authentic flavor.\nHad some chorizo tacos and the meat was stellar.  Nice spice and the corn tortillas were cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend this place.  \nIf you're used to eating at Roberto's you will find this place is leagues better and with lower prices to boot.","The tacos AL Pastor  and de carnitas are awesome.  The enchiladas are good too. Their green salsa is tasty.  I liked the Horchata because it wasn't super sweet.  We will be back.","Was surprised of the quality! Had the tacos. The beans were very tasty. Had the chips and guacamole. Was not what I thought. Negative there.","This place rules. I'm guilty of settling for Taco Bell for lunch before, but one time the line for the drive thru was nuts while the one for Tacos La Mexicana, which is right across the way,  was barren. I decided to stop betraying my heritage and give their drive thru a try, even though I knew it would take a little longer considering I was buying real food. The wait wasn't too much longer though: I got my food in minutes, it beat the crap out of Taco Bell, and I've been going here ever since. I loved everything I've had so far, the people are always nice and very accomodating, and the cost won't kill your wallet.","Food was so so. I wanted to try them vs Roberto's but the food wasn't seasoned well and i didn't much care for the chicken rolled tacos. The carna asada taco was ok. Im from cali so i know good Mexican food and this isn't it.","Tacos La Mexicana is the place to go for lunch. For only $5.99, you get four tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small drink. I usually get their chicken and pastor (pork) tacos. The chicken is not particularly seasoned and is more like pulled chicken. The pastor is not the best that I've ever tried, but it is definitely decent. The food in general is tasty, and the price is even better.\n\nI also like their small salsa bar. The red salsas are all delicious, and my favorite salsa is the green one (without seeds). It is packed with flavor and is definitely their spiciest salsa.\n\nOverall, the service, price, and food is great and a must-try!"],"business_id":"mI4ozvIRxcGqwGdbd9i8NA","name":"Tacos La Mexicana","categories":["Food","Food Delivery Services","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["This Filiberto's was not as yummy as other ones. I don't know if it is just a difference in cooks but the food just didn't taste that good. This was the closest one to my work; I now have found other Mexican food restaurants by my work. Don't want to go back to this location again. I would gladly go to other locations though. Filib's makes for great drunk, and hung-over, food!","\"Best Mexican Food in Arizona, California, New Mexico\"? Oh God I hope not. If so, I am so sorry.\n\nI went there the other day with some co-workers and ordered the #17--2 Carne Asada Tacos for $7.77. While I waited for my plate to come out, I helped myself to the self-service chips & salsa bar. The food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite generous.\n\nI was presented with the typical Mexican plate--tacos, rice, and refried beans. While the carne asada tacos were relatively average, the accompanying rice and beans were absolutely terrible. Honestly...how can you mess up rice and beans? They tasted like they were mixed with cleaning solution.\n\nIn retrospect, any place that prides itself as \"Best...\" is a self-delusional ploy at convincing yourself that your canned/frozen goods are better than other places' fresh goods. Methinks not.","The food came out quick. I recommend the chicken quesadilla plate.","I like Filibertos a lot. I have eaten at most of the locations several times. This particular location is pretty reliable, there are some occasional misses but they are rare. They have a fairly nice and large interior with a salsa bar. Try an arizona burrito with beans or the two taco combo... delicious. And don't worry about rumors, I have been eating Filibertos since high school, hundreds of times by now, and have never, EVER, gotten sick.","Ugh. I love Filbertos cheap, tasty food but I hate the service! I called earlier today to see if they could deliver. A girl picked up, said \"hold on\" and hung up. Then I called back several times and nobody answered. Pretty obvious they were dodging my calls.","soggy food","So I love burritos and will try one at just about any Mexican fast food place. I know what to expect when I eat at those places and know what to expect from Filibertos but this Filibertos should be closed down.It was horrible and nearly inedible. I really love food and usually can deal with some bad stuff but this was just disgusting. The tortilla was overcooked as well as everything else inside. The meat was horrible and very low quality. Be sure to avoid this location at all costs. Could not finish my food and it gave me a sour stomach throughout the night into the morning.","I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.","Definitely a real Filibertos. The food was pretty good; what I expect when I go to any Filibertos location. I got the chicken tacos (as I usually do), and they were pretty good. I will say, though, that I had some pretty nasty, kind of painful indigestion the next day... so I'm not sure what to think of that. Could be because I haven't been eating much processed food lately. Careful, though.","Have you ever had to wait 30 minutes in the drive through? Neither had I until I went to this hell hole. The obese woman who takes your money had a look of emptiness in her eyes as if she knows her life has peaked. I'm sure the cook was sleeping or getting high in the bathroom while I was waiting for my order of one burrito with two cars in front of me. I can't believe it took literally 30 minutes from when I drove up to when I was given my receipt and not even thanked for paying them to give me diarrhea. Screw that.","In general, I really like Filiberto's, but that comes with some warnings. Most of the menu ranges from mediocre/uninteresting to genuinely bad. It took me awhile to find something I liked here (came back because my friends loved it). There are some obvious staples that you can't go wrong with  like cheese quesadillas, ground beef tacos, etc. The cheese quesadillas especially are amazing as a simple item almost everyone would like, and although they can be expensive (not counting the $1.19 jr. quesadillas on friday!), it's only because they're huge!\n\nBut the best thing at FiliB's, to me, is the Arizona burrito drenched in hot sauce. Their hot sauce is amazing by the way. Most of their steak-based burritos are great. Carne Asada, AZ, California. Their fish tacos and shrimp burritos are great too, though a little pricey. So yeah, generally, Filiberto's has some great greasy fast food if you know what to order.\n\nThe reason this only gets 2 stars though, is that even the \"good\" food here is pretty bad. I don't know what it is about this location, if their employees don't know how to work a grill or if they use worse ingredients, but their food is consistently worse than other locations (specifically the one on Guadalupe and McClintock, which is always amazing and has free chips too!). But the cheese in the burritos consistently comes completely unmelted, the meat in them is always weirdly textured, and the employees clearly don't give a shit about helping you at all.\n\nAnd not that it really matters that much, but the interior of this place is kind of a shit-hole. I've seen worse in this chain, but I've seen much better as well.\n\nOverall: I go to this place because it's the closest filiberto's to me and sometimes I crave it. But if I truly want to enjoy the food that Filiberto's has to offer in its fullest, I make the drive to a different location.","Worst place to stop and eat in the morning. 3 cars in the drive way and it's taking 20 mins. This is not the first time. Seems only one person works at this time.","I don't really know what the heck I just ate here, but I thought I had ordered a Carne Asada burrito.  They gave me a bunch of meat, guac, salsa all wrapped in a fried tortilla...where is the produce??  It tasted like a gigantic greasy abomination...im sorry but that is not a burrito.  I'm not sure of the quality of the meat, but I think I'll try and find a better place to go for my lunch break.","Sorry excuse for a filebertos horrible staff carna asada full of grease carnitas full of grease dirty restaurant meat taste like it might make me sick you will be better off going to taco bell","Came here on my lunch break for a simple $5 meal. I waited in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes. The last five minutes of waiting took place AFTER I had finally paid. TOO SLOW!!! You would think in all that time I would get my meal the way I asked, without lettuce. But they actually went and put extra lettuce. So rediculous. Never had problems at this Fili B's before until today. Not going back.","Usually my stop before heading into my account if I am working the night shift.  The food is a'ight.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito and often find that the cheese isn't melted.  Which is crazy that it isn't warmer considered how long the wait is.","Excellent customer service is imperative, this location does not have that. Visited this location on 4/29/14 around 10:45PM and the girl that took our order was rude. I'm chalking down that she hates her job and probably her life. Granted, she did say \"thank you\" once, so she has some hope of success in customer service. It's nice this location is open 24hr and 70% of the time they get your order right. I'll drive to another location for my hungover needs.","Hit's the spot - not Taco Tore down in El Paso - they set the bar for me in drive through cheap Mexican","Food has always been good at this location: no food poisoning and tastes great! The wait can be a little long sometimes but only like 3-5 minutes longer than your average fast food place. To me, it seems like the longer wait times are due to the fact that they make to order things since I've never seem the employees be lazy/slow and even with no one ahead of me, it always seems like they are making the order just for me!","Service sucks. Food is decent, except they never get the order right.  Every time I have been there I have either been treated so poorly for no reason, I would rather go to a different location so I don't get snarled at by the staff.","It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, but differ considerably in food quality and service.\n\nThis one is the worst Filiberto's I've been to. Dirty, poor quality, and staff we encountered were argumentative and rude. I think my wife and I got sick from the food at this one.\n\nLike any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless!","After hearing a few individuals talk about Filibertos at work I thought I would give them a try.  Sadly to say after 3 different meals and visits to their drive thru I have to report the food is beyond edible or palatable.   On two occasions the beans and rice were disgusting.   I attempted the chicken quesadillas were sandwiched between two massive tortillas with queso slop not cheese, the chicken tasted like canned chicken that had not been opened in years.  Instead of putting sour cream and guacamole on the side it slopped on inside which added to a even sloppy mess.  The flavors were so bad that this expensive mess had to be just thrown out.  With all the options there are for Mexican food....runnnnn to somewhere else.  Serrano's was heaven compared to this place.","Filiberto's is a local favorite for late-night Mexican food. The quality of food has always been decent and worth the wait-time. This location takes exceptionally long, but it's a good sign that your food is fresh. \n\nItems to get: Bacon Breakfast Burritos, Carne Asada Fries and anything with Guacamole. Their salsa is also decent and has some kick to it.","I love that you are always there for me, all hours of the night, less than a mile from my home. I always get the bean and cheese burrito with extra cheese. I am no thrill seeker here. I really really dislike just about all Mexican food, but the bean and cheese stays close to my heart. I get bean and cheese burritos every time my husband drags me to one of these shady little Mexican establishments, and I would say that Filibertos does not do it best. This particular location is one of the biggest I have seen, but still a little too sketch for me to sit and eat there. Also, the drive thru takes FOREVER. Just run in - it will be much faster. Good burritos, and I will always be back for you, Filis!","Wanna know how to ALWAYS get something good from this 'Bertos?\n\nOrder this:\n\nSteak Egg and Cheese Burrito\n\nThat puppy will NEVER let you down.  Moist, tender, flavorful carne asada with fried egg (yolks cooked all the way - not runny) and artery-choking cheddar cheese.\n\nIt is a huge amount of food, and be sure to ask for 3 containers of red salsa if you are taking it \"To Go\" as you will need that many to have salsa with every bite.\n\nThe flavors meld together VERY WELL and this will hit both your salt craving and your protein sweet spot.  It's my favorite \"fast food\" burrito in town - and I've had a LOT of them over the last 15+ years of living in The PHX.\n\nGuaranteed you will like this one, if you eat carne asada and eggs in any other setting.","Will try not to eat here unless I am drunk. Greasiest tortillas I've ever eaten. The location off Guadalupe and Mcclintock is much tastier.","Hey, we know what we're getting with Filiberto's... cheap Mexican grub in large quantities! Some Filiberto's are clean and somewhat nice, this location definitely isn't one of them.  The dining room was dark, grimey and dingy, the tables are too high for the bench seats, and whats with only turning on a single light in the entire space???  The restaurant had a weird odor ( I probably don't want to know what it was) and our food was all extremely over cooked, probanly spending an entire day under the warming lights because most people have abandoned this location.  Every single thing in the restaurant was worn out and dirty. Time to spend a few bucks on a rehab or close this dump down. What a waste of a meal!","My fiance and I just left there. We are drunk and happy, so most food, at this point, would be pleasing to the palate. \n\nHowever, as we sat there debating the 17 pounds of inedible food left on our plates, here was our conversation:\n\n\"We just paid $17 for this shit?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Should we take it home to the dogs?\"\n\n\"I don't really feel comfortable giving it to them, do you?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\nAnd so then, we threw that crap in the trash can.\n\nThat about sums it up. Next time, I will indulge in Jack in the Box tacos: 2 for $0.99.","\"I have never gotten sick from this place\" shouldn't be a positive review. I haven't...but still. I stopped going here the second time I got an incorrectly rolled burrito. I mean c'mon! The name of the place is Filibertos and the entire staff is Mexican! Incorrectly rolled burritos? TWICE!?!?! WTF?\n\nIt'll work for me if its 230am and I am in a car that is already going through the drive through. I have often made the decision to go to Denny's across the street for late night grub. They've never f'ed up a burrito there!","A lot of food for a cheap price; that's the only reason this place doesn't get one star. Place is just nasty dirty! Used my debit through the drive through, and the guy hands me the thing to type in my pin and its just covered with crap. By crap I mean it looked like it was dunked in grease, and then splashed with some kind of red sauce. I told him I wasn't about to touch that, you could tell he was mad. Thought he would clean it off, instead ran me as credit...","Dear Filly B's,\n\nI have loved you long time, we were bff for nearly 10 years... that is until you gave me food poisoning. I will never eat carne asada again thanks to you. I knew we wouldn't last forever, nothing that hot and heavy ever lasts long.","we had been frequenting this location for many years (probably 60+ visits), but we will never go there again. . it has gone so downhill...i agree with the earlier review that stated that it should be closed down. it seems like every surface in this place is dirty, and the service is exactly what the opposite of friendly is. you would think that after giving this place so much business, after being regular customers for so many years, that we would be treated nicely...not the case. we were treated so rudely the last time we went (by an awful lady who works the drive-thru window late at night), that we vowed to never go there again.  there is a new location over on priest and washington that has much better condiments, is a much nicer restaurant, and has a far friendlier staff.","I visited this place on 9/1/2013. I love that they are open 24 hours. I recently moved to the area and after a long day of moving my husband and I were very hungry. We used to eat at Julioberto's in Phoenix (see my review on them), and I was skeptical about Filiberto's after hearing they are nothing like Julio's. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge, like a Julio's, but the food was different. My husband's Chimichanga was great! and I enjoyed the burrito/taco combo I got as well. I like Filiberto's beans better than those served at Julioberto's. We each got a huge combo and split a drink (with a side of sour cream) for under $20, which, for the portions, is very fair. If we weren't so hungry, we could have easily split a combo, which we often do at Julio's. \nAnother thing I appreciated about this place was that they got my order correct. At Julio's I often was missing little extra add-ons, or they would get my drink order wrong. Nothing devastating, just irritating and Filiberto's GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!!\nIf you're looking for a late night tasty Mexican feast for cheap-- LOOK NO FURTHER and go to Filiberto's!","Not the best taqureria.I prefer amados late night or Rivas.but its close to my house after a late painting session or working in the garage,if you order simple you,ll be fine,preferably if you have a maxi can buddy to order for you,you probably wont get the squirts,haha","While my friend Rand H. enjoyed his meal here, I was not impressed.  There are no Filibertos in Northern California.  When I moved to Arizona and saw them all over I thought I might want to try them.  Almost everyone I know said \"noooooo, don't do it!\".  But I did not listen.  And I do like to think for myself.  Not everyone has the same taste so I gave it go. The taco shell was a bit stale, the meat tasted over cooked and greasy.  There was only one good thing about the burrito, the tortilla was fresh.  Overall I doubt I will go back but at least I can say I tried it.","Eek, aren't the reviews for THIS place all over the map?     :-O\n\nTo find out what's really going on here, I stopped in today for my first visit ever to a Filiberto's.  What struck me as soon as I entered was the floor plan & furnishings exactly like the Carl's Jr. I used to go to regularly in Los Angeles!  I guess this used to be a Carl's.\n\nLooking up at the picture menu, I spotted Plate #17 with 2 Chiles Rellenos for $6.79.  I didn't see anything else there, except a dab of salad, so I ordered that item plus a ground beef taco for only 99 cents extra, & hoped it would be enough.\n\nWow!  Help-yourself warm chips & various salsas, FREE!  There's one Star right there!\n\nPretty soon, Señorita calls me over to the window to pick up my tray.  ¡Santa caca!  What a HUGE plate of food!  Along with my Chiles Rellenos were generous servings of Spanish Rice & refried beans, as well as good dollops of sour cream & Guacamole, PLUS a lettuce & Pico de Gallo salad!  On top of that, there was a big roll of 2 HUGE flour tortillas, plus the taco I shouldn't have ordered, which was big, too!\n\nI'm a Chile Relleno nut, & the ones here were made with big, mild but tasty Anaheim chiles, stuffed with lots of melted Oaxaca cheese, & topped with grated cheddar cheese, plus the sour cream I scooped on.  They were REALLY GOOD!!  The Spanish Rice & refried beans were very good too, the salad ok, & I didn't care much for the taste of the taco, although it was BIG for 99 cents.\n\nI don't think this is \"one of the best in town\" overall, as the competition is tough, but I will say that they're not afraid to really feed you at this place, & you could do a lot worse!     (Go to Taco Bite to put things into prospective!)     :-))","Pretty ghetto restaurant, not a surprise though based on the prices.\n\nI've always heard people complaining about Filiberto's and getting food poisoning and whatnot, however in 5 years that's yet to happen to me.  Many a long night of drinking has ultimately led me here, and my favorite thing to get, hands down, is the pollo asado burrito.  Carne asada isn't too bad, either, and I really can't comment on most of the other food because I mainly eat those two burritos.  I've taken my parents here a few times when they'd flown into town and their only complaint was that they kept getting too much food and would never be able to finish the leftovers.\n\nIt's not some la-di-da place, however Filiberto's will always have a place in my heart...","Initially coming into this Filiberto's for lunch, I thought I had accidentally stumbled into a Halloween themed haunted house.  I check my phone for the date and see that it is too early for Halloween.  Interesting.  Someone tried to pass this place off as a restaurant.  Wow, you got me going, good job.  Scared the shit out of me!\n\nLet us hit the brakes and back up a bit.  The parking lot here has had zero maintenance performed on it.  I think this building used to be an old Carl's Jr. or Jack in the crack that was poorly renovated and has a really piss poor paint job on the exterior.  Potholes in the parking lot made me think my truck had a flex capacitor in it and brought me back in to time to when I was in Philadelphia, dealing with the world's shittiest roads.  Nope, still in Arizona.  I assume there is a lobbyist in the vehicle alignment business working hand and hand with this establishment.\n\nIf you can get through this minefield of the parking lot, might as well go for broke and come into the restaurant.  There is an entertainment factor due to the signs all over the place yelling at you to not fill up your cup with soda if you have not paid for it.  Classy.\n\nI don't expect fillet mignon from Filiberto's but I also don't expect to have the cook stare at me the entire time I am waiting for my food.  That guy looks really pissed off.\n\nBeen here several times and wanted to enjoy the chip and salsa bar with almost zero chances to seize the opportunity.  The chips that are left are broken if there is any in there at all.  Ask them to put more in, the cook will just stare at you.  No chip refill.  There is a plastic fork laying in one of the salsa containers.\n\nThe air conditioning control unit is hanging about a food off of the ceiling only suspended by the failing duct tape trying so hard to defy gravity, like Sylvester Stallone trying to save the girl in the Movie \"Cliffhanger.\"  The walls here looked like there was wallpaper ripped off and never replaced.  A few of the seats have no padding on them,  but plenty of graffitti to read to help pass the time.  My particular booth on one visit read \"Fukkin Crakar\" written on it.  Maybe I should bring my Mom here for lunch.  I can teach her all there is to know about racial slang.\n\nThe bathroom is constantly trashed with no soap and am amazing amount of piss all over the floor.  No worries, there is yet more gang graffitti written in languages I can't read all over the stalls which I assume is not a positive message (like \"have a great day, champ!\")  There is no sign to indicate the men's room from the women's room either, the first time I was in there the men's room sign was sitting in the urinal.  Think they replaced it? \n\nBagging on Filiberto's is easy and I know that, but this particular location seems to really go out of their way to have a beat to shit restaurant.  It is more depressing than the condition of a landscaping pick up truck I once owned.  \n\nIf it wasn't for the Tuesday 99 cent menu... well...I really don't know how to finish this sentence.","No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look","Our friend brought us some Filibertos because it was 3a and we were hungry. It was okay. The tortilas were a bit stale and dry on the burritos. The guac isn't good. It has value going for it though; the portions are cheap and gigantic, especially the carne asada fries. They seemed like a giant plate of frozen fries that a few carne asada tacos were emptied out over. And since it was 3a, even not-great Mexican food was greatly appreciated.","I am just s sucker for a chips and salsa bar. This is the only location I am aware of with one.\nInside an ex McDonalds sits this Filibertos, on island in a decaying parking lot. The menu is standard for fast hole in the wall Mexican. This may not come as a surprise to my readers but I opt for the chili rellno burrito. I really like their take on it. It consists of the obligatory chili rellno but it is surrounded by guacamole and a tortilla, simple rich and oh so good.\n\nAs I stated before the draw of this location is the free chips at the salsa bar. The chips the usual well ground corn chips slightly warmed, but the free party really adds to the meal, on average I think I can add over 1000 calories for free to my lunch. \n\nAdding to the self serve fun this is one of the few locations with a soda fountain that you can access for free refills.","You can't go wrong with the chile relleno, chicken, or breakfast burritos. I can't believe there isn't a review of this place up yet. The horchata isn't as good as La Tolteca's, but you can't walk to La Tolteca from Palo Verde at 2 in the morning, and it wouldn't even be open anyhow. My 5 stars take into consideration the price (extremely cheap), service (always solid, not exceptional, but generally friendly at a minimum), and cleanliness (may look grubby, but I've never gotten sick). \n\nI don't think the jukebox works.\n\nThe chips with guacamole are decent (they come with a mountain of shredded cheddar) but only if you add some red salsa.\n\nLITTLE KNOWN SECRET ALERT: free chips at lunchtime (could be weekdays only). Do it.","This is a decent Filiberto's.  Certainly better than the abomination on Apache Blvd.  But it's not nearly as strong as some of the Phoenix locations, specifically the one at 19th Ave & Dunlap.\n\nRanking the various Filiberto's and its numerous imitators is an important exercise for taqueria fans in Phoenix.  Serious connoisseurs of 24-hour Mexican food need to know how to avoid stale torillas, under-stuffed burritos and slimy chicken.","My old school late night 'bertos was in North Phoenix, but this has become my handy work 'bertos.  \n\nConfession:  Every once in a while I get a hankering for a greasy quesadilla dipped in hot sauce - at 7am.  I know it's weird.  I can't even explain it.  But say 3-4 times a year the urge strikes and it strikes hard.  This place has satisfied that urge in style.  As a 'bertos quesadilla fan I have to say - be prepared to swab it down with some napkins.  Because it is 100% real cheese so it can be a greasy mess.  \n\nThe same could be said for much of their food.  It may be greasy - but at least it's real.  You know what you're eating.  One of their cheap combos is an easy 2 lunches.  And while this place definately falls into the \"fast food, crap food\" category vs. the \"hole in the wall, heaven\" kind of food - it's a great alternative to have.","anyone who has lived in the East Valley for more than two years and says they've never eaten here on a after-bar food run is a mentiroso (liar).\n\nopen 24 hours, this is only good when your taste buds, along with your judgment, is compromised.\n\nfast food, but no taco bell, this is more authentic. come 2:30 am on the weekends, and even weekdays, the drive thru line snakes around the building, and it's almost all drunk drivers. i don't know why the tempe PD doesn't just stake out the drive thru exit and pick off DUI offenders one by one. expect to see girls running behind bushes to pee and guys trying to start fights from windows, and consider it entertainment as you wait for your food (this can be a 20-30 minute expedition during peak hours).\nfood is not bad, and relatively cheap. just try not to pass out in your car while waiting for it"],"business_id":"mQ6_slsCd8-c8WFNtESnqw","name":"Filibertos Mexican Food","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["This is the second food truck I've tried since the craze hit Phoenix and I still just don't get it. \nNow, the food was great (I got the Pot Head[?] Quesadilla - cheese, potatoes, spinach, green hatch chilis but sans pico for me, and it came with chips and salsa) and the service was friendly but it was a bit overpriced ($8 for single tortilla folded in half and a small handful of chips) for the amount of food and ingredients (including a meat in it would have made it worth it, perhaps, but that was for another $1). I give them credit for the great tortilla and chips, obviously home made as it was fresh and moist, and including plenty of cheese - plus being able to pay with my card instead of relying on cash -, but I wouldn't try it again. \nI was sad they didn't have the lemonade in mason jars they're supposedly famous for since this was at the Four Peaks 16th anniversary party - I asked and she said no because there's beer. I realise I was at an event for a brewery but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm drinking.","Great Food Truck Friday experience at Luncha Libre! I had the Steak and Bleu which came with a side of chips and homemade salsa. It was delicious! Definitely interested in trying other menu items...","LOVE LOVE LOVE this food truck!  I have been many times, the Arizona Cheesecake is one of my favorites and it a delicious spicy cheese steak sandwich.  I have also had the Vietnamese taco's which were amazing, the steak and bleu and the Thai'd up.  Everything is so good, it is hard to decide what I want anytime I go.  The drinks are super as well.  Fresh and tasty, so good on a hot summer day!  I recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something delicious, because you will not be disappointed!","Luncha Libre is my usual stop for Food Truck Friday. I can't get enough of their Steak and Bleu quesadilla: Carne Asada and Bleu cheese with chips and salsa? SO DAMN good!\n\nThey have other varieties as well including the All Thai'd Up, which is chicken with an Asian twist. Sounds good but as far as I'm concerned, if it ain't broke don't fix it. I'll stick with my Steak and Bleu, thank you very much.\n\nLOVE YOU GUYS!","I have had the sheer luck of being able to enjoy Luncha Libra on many different occasions. I have to tell you their food and service is OUTSTANDING! I have been known to drive downtown from Anthem just to get these tasty morsels across my lips! \nThere is always a tasty variety of things to choose from, and the menu changes daily. Ohh, almost forgot...portion size is great! These guys will really spice things up for you too, just ask! \nLong story short, try them!!! There is no way you will walk away disappointed!","My husband and I first tried this food truck while at Urban Cookies, and now .... we log on at least weekly to see where we can follow them to. Ya, it can be a little pricey, but soooo worth it. And the luncharitas are amazing!","Ok, I finally got food from Luncha Libre and it was phenemonal, one of the best hamburgers I've had in my life! It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, great quality of meat, fantastic toppings, and it was a great size.\n\nThe Luncharitas are one of my favorite things on earth and if I could only drink 1 thing for the rest of my life those would be what I choose.","I love this food truck.  The chorizo they serve is amongst the best I've had.  I took my boyfriend to the truck - he was a skeptic about how good and amazing food can be from a truck - now he's a convert.  Treat yourself and eat anything they have on their menu... it's worth it.  YUM!!!","Sooo good. I wish they'd stop circling so close to my work, because it takes a lot of restraint not to get it every week.  Both the Steak and Bleu and All Thai'd Up are amazing.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey given the portions, but it's absolutely worth it.  Plus, with one of their huge drinks (all the teas are phenomenal), I have never finished a meal and still felt hungry.  Plus if you return your mason jar, you get $1 off the next meal.\n\nThey can get thru a long line pretty quickly, but be prepared for a bit of a wait if you go in the middle of their slot. I find I usually beat the lunch rush right when they arrive.\n\nCatch them at Urban Cookie for a great cupcake afterward!","The best food truck around! Amazingly delicious quesadillas; mouth-watering agua frescas; and by far some of the best salsa I've ever had. It's fire roasted and when paired with their freshly made chips, it's heaven.\n\nBest part about this food truck? They're very active on social so if you give suggestions or feedback, they'll acknowledge you. They made horchata on request for me and gave me a free jar. They now know me and my coworkers by name. \n\nGreat service and even better food.","Oh man.\n\nI almost wish Luncha Libre was at a non-mobile location so I could visit anytime I wanted.  The luncharitas are refreshing, and I love that you can keep the mason jar afterwards.\n\nI have dreams of the Papa Verde quesadilla.  Dreams.\n\nThe Luncha Libre Food Truck is worth visiting even on a 110+ degree day.  You can also follow their Facebook page for new food items!","Had the Steak and bleu Quesadilla today, absolutely phenomenal!!!!!!! Tortilla home made and fantastic, inside filling to die for! Chips and salsa delicious!!!!!!! SOOOOOO Glad I had this for lunch!!!!! Definitely eating their food again!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Mmmmmm quesadilla...........\n\nTried these guys at the ASU food truck block party. So delicious. I couldt decide between the deliciousness I got or another item, but since the girl taking my order (super nice) proclaimed that said deliciousness is her fave item they serve, I had to try it. Potatoes...in a quesadilla? She honestly couldve just told me that and I wouldve still been sold.\n\nMy friend, however, got the chefs secret special... holy god was it good. Totaly worth what he paid for it.\n\nCant wait til next Wed when I can try the chefs secret special for myself along w/ one of their Luncha-ritas!","Ohhhhh   Yeeeeeahhhhh!  Now we are talking!!   For me when I am hungry and unsure what to eat at home I turn to making a trusty quesadilla.  Warm, crispy, cheesy goodness that satisfies my hunger.   \nBut there are times I do crave something more and Luncha Libre does that for me.  It fills a need, comforts me in a moment of indecision and feeds my hunger.  Crispy tortillas filled with a variety of creative flavor combinations of meats, cheese and veggies.  [I have also seen hamburgers on their menu but I have yet to try them.]   \n\nMy favorite go to is their Papa y Verde.  Warm [Hot] nicely fried potatoes with cheese and green chile.  Comfort food goodness.  \n\nThey also have these amazing drinks in various flavors.  Some are like the traditional Agua Fresca you would find at a Mexican restaurant and others more sophisticated like mint green tea.    The coolest part (depending on how you look at it) is they are served in a cool reusable multi-purpose class canning jar.  I use them when they get home but for some carrying around a jar around 1st Friday after you have finished your drink can be a bit of a 'burden' .\n\nThey are a great balance of  simple complexity and complex simplicity.\n\nLuncha does not disappoint.","This is the second time I eat here, the first time was surprisingly delicious, and this time, the food kept its momentum, it was also delicious. \nI didn't get a chance to try the Papa+Verde, which seems to be very popular because after waiting in line for a long time, when I finally was able to put in my order, they had run out, so I went with the Alejandro The Great Quesadilla, which was Gyro beef, Kalamata Olives, Feta & melting cheese. Was really yummy, and also got the Mango/Peach I believe in the mason jar. The drink was pretty expensive at $4 each, but you get to keep the huge jar, and can bring it back next time for a $1 refill, not bad!!\n  Will be back to try the Papas-Verdes!!","Had the pleasure of trying Luncha Libre today at the Coronado home tour. I admit I was skeptical. I mean, it's a quesadilla. Tortilla and stuff in it. Had it hundred of time after living in Houston all my life and now Phoenix. Well done Luncha Libre. Well done! The tortilla was perfectly crispy, everything was held together nicely. It wasn't that sloppy-everything-falls-out-in1-bite quesadilla. Flavors were great. I had the Marco Pollo (clever name) - which was a chicken quesadilla, pico de gallo, and hoisin sauce. Thus the clever Marco Polo pun of Asian fusion. I added a little sriracha and more cilantro in mine and it was perfection! The balance of spicy of sriracha and pico de gallo, the sweetness of the hoisin, and plentiful amount of chicken to entertain my taste buds. Simply great trucking food!","Mac Daddy Quesadilla is Da BOMB!!  Omg I will eat this every time they have it.  Please don't change anything it's perfect just the way it is.","I started my love of food trucks with Luncha Libre. On a random visit to Urban Cookies I noticed there was a food truck that had a luchador painted on the side. Being Mexican, I was instantly curious. So I grabbed a quesadilla. I was in heaven. It was delicious. The salsa was perfect and the quesadilla was just the right size for lunch. I even grabbed one of their luncharitas. Also delicious. I'm lucky to live nearby a few of their stops so I try to stop whenever possible, although these days fewer times than I'd like thanks to my waistline. If my pants allowed it, I think I could eat at their truck everyday. I should confess, that quesadillas are one of my favorite foods, but even then, luncha libre's are the best. Their staff is always super friendly and they get you your food fairly quickly. My favorite is the their steak and blue but my husband swears by their hamburgers. Be warned, these might induce a nap/coma. They're big and delicious. You can follow them on facebook, twitter, and instagram to learn their stops for the day.","So we were wondering around First Friday last night 2/7/2014, and our 8 year old decided he was starving.  Tucked in behind a couple of galleries was the Luncha Libre truck.  The menu looked enticing and we were not let down.  I had the Steak & Bleu Quesadilla and it was absolutely delicious. My husband had Alejandro The Great and it to was yummy.  Our son had a chicken and cheese that he devoured. The quesadillas all came with a side of homemade chips and salsa that were much better than most you would find in a resturant  We also tried the homemade drinks of a black iced tea, a peach iced tea and a lemonade.  All of the drinks were served in large Mason Jars with the lid on.  Talk about a totally unique food experience.  We thought the pricing was pretty fair for the portion size that we got. From the gentleman taking our order who was friendly and had a great sense of humor to the amazing chef inside.  We totally loved our experience and may have to start stalking this truck.","The hubster and I didn't get a chance to try this truck at the ill-fated Street Eats Food Truck Festival. Alas, we were destined to part of the crowd that went hungry, unsatisfied and without feeling in our legs after standing in a line for 3.5 hours only to get to try ONE truck. So thank the stars that aligned and brought us to a local event this past Sunday where Lunch Libre was parked and...behold...there wasn't a line a mile deep! \n\nWe immediately placed our order before our luck could change and managed to try their potato/chile quesadilla and their chicken torta sandwich. We are sooooo glad we got a second chance to try this food truck! Hubby and I were both super impressed with how fresh and flavorful the salsa and veggies tasted. They really added to the quesadilla and sandwich instead of being simple filler. After polishing off my entire quesadilla in a few giant bites, I told my husband that I could see myself craving this again...translation: we MUST begin stalking LL asap.\n\nThe bonus to this truck is how nice the owners are. They were super friendly and really made you feel like you were enjoying a home made meal. The pride in their food was obvious and contributed to our overall experience. We can't wait to try more menu items!","Went tonight during CCV's Neon Dash. Food was awesome, as usual. Staff was plentiful, friendly, and attentive.  Had my usual...... Steak and Bleu with chips. Also had a churro this time. It was more than enough to eat!  Leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Son had Carnae Asada and a churro. Mango Lemonades for both of us. Thanks Tim, Kim, and crew for a great time!","I have had the sheer luck of being able to enjoy Luncha Libra on many different occasions. I have to tell you their food and service is OUTSTANDING!

There is no way you will walk away disappointed!","First of all, I'm not a fan of the price for a small/easy quesadilla.  I am a fan of the potatoes and green chile quesadilla I had because I think the combo and smell was really great.  I ordered thinking it was going to be some type of gooey green sauce, but instead it's like grilled sliced potatoes and strips of green chile and pico de gallo mix (onions/tomatoe).  As soon as I opened the little box it smelled so yummy!\n\nI also had the orange/mango drink which tasted like kool-aid or some type of powder mix....I guess it thought it would be like a fresh ingredients type of drink with a little pulp or something..  Anyhow, the glass it comes in is really big and can be used to store other things.  From reading other reviews I understand if you take it back you get a $1 off your next order?  I would never had known that because no one told me when I ordered it :(\n\n$12 dollars total for lunch...and I picked up 3 cupcakes from Urban Cookies! Yummy...  Apparently if you follow them on Facebook sometimes they give you a code word or something to get a free cupcake!","Yum!\nA girlfriend and I planned a lunch date for Tuesday. Not too sure where we were meeting, but I noticed she commented on Luncha Libre's facebook page that morning. They were set to be across the street from her office, so we decided that would be a perfect little lunch.\nShe ordered the papaverde (potato and green chile) quesadilla and I had the grilled chicken - with the plan to share so we could try both. \nWe both inhaled our food so quickly we forgot the sharing plan! She said hers was fantastic, and I am enamored with the citrus marinated chicken.\nPortions were a bit smaller than I was expecting for the $8.50, but the quality is definitely there!\nI also ordered the honey vanilla iced tea (served in mason jar for $4.00, but with $1.00 off if I bring the jar back for refills) - it was subtle and delicious!\n\nDefinitely a nice add to the food truck scene - I look forward to trying more of their offerings!","[Sigh]\n\nI had to share my meal. \n\nI'm an idiot. \n(But if you know me you already knew that. But seriously -  Never give up the FORK POWER!)\n\nLuncha Libra was at the Scottsdale Food Truck Caravan. I'm going to keep an ear to the ground to see where these kids are around town. GOOD STUFF!\n\nAll Thai'D Up\" (Ha!)\nConsisted of citrus marinated chicken, serranos, onions (no one needs to kiss me, food is involved! carry on), jack cheese and sweet thai chile sauce. When there's a feeding frenzy going on it isn't pretty. (Hey, the FOOD WAS GOOD!)\n\nWhen asked if \"regular\" was ok we nodded. \"Eh?\" Turns out that \"spicy\" really would have been a kick in the pants. And this is from the kid who grew up sucking on Taco Bell extra hot packets. And the adult who has an established relationship with Sriracha.\n\n(Listen, I have a very myopic view on life: Food/booze, the gym, fashion and beauty products. Women understand. Spice goes well with food. These guys totally have the hot market cornered!)\n\nBiting into the Quesadilla was a delightful mix of textures and flavors. The tortilla was thicker than I expected and had a slight crunch to the outside. (None of the expected goopy mushiness that can happen with so many other quesadillas.) The chicken had been grilled and I can't do justice to describe how wonderful the taste was. Which really just means YOU SHOULD EAT THIS. \n\nYeah, pretty much. I'm sitting here trying to articulate how great my eating experience was. Words fail right now. I should have whipped out my Yelp pen. But NO. I was too busy STUFFING MY FACE. Yeah. That.\n\nOh! Drinks are really good. They have some fancy sounding drinks (which I can't find on their menu) that come in a mason jar. The Guava something - Hoh My. YUM!\n\nHigh Five for This Food Truck!","I had the Thai chicken quesadilla for lunch.  It was everything I expected and more!  Delicious crispy tortilla on the outside and warm melty cheese with plenty of chicken and onions inside.  The only thing I didn't like that much was that the Thai sauce was a little too sweet.  I really loved the salsa they served on the side, and the chips were great too although a tad too thick for my liking.  I am full and happy now.","Yum! What drew me in far and away were the beautiful luncharitas in all of their tasty looking splendor! I couldn't stand watching everyone drinking them all around me and not try one of my own. They are as delicious a they look and you won't be disappointed. Their All Thai'd Up quesadilla is to die for! Anything with thai sweet chili sauce is OK by me! And their churros are delectable as well. I only gave them 4 stars for a couple of reasons. I wasn't particularly impressed with their Steak and Blue quesadilla, it seemed a bit bland when I had it. Their menu is pricey! 4 dollars for a drink is a lot. Yes I know you get a glass, but what if you don't want it. You should be able to walk back and get your dollar back that day, not a promise of a credit on your next one. Lastly the line can be absolutely atrocious. Now I know it's hard to hate because they are so popular, but it seems there might be a more efficient way to manage the line. Maybe a line just for luncharitas, so those wanting only drinks didn't have to wait in the full food line. Just an idea. All in all I love this place, love supporting local business, and eating yummy food! COME TO THE WEST VALLEY!","Finally broke down and tried Luncha Libre at this past Saturday's Food Truck Caravan in Scottsdale.  \n\nWhat the hell have I been waiting for!? \n\nI had the Steak and Blue - Cause 2 of my loves are STEAK and moldy cheese goodness.  J and the Thai'D Up, which he said was nice and spicy.\n\nA little bit on the pricey side for the portion, but you'll wont go hungry after eating 1 quesadilla.  Had a strawberry banana Luncharita...which was super tasty!  Pretty nifty putting them in glass mason jars.  And I hear tell that if you bring the mason jar back, you'll get $1 off your next visit!  \n\nI think we'll return","Now I know I just wrote a review of L.L. last week, but we went to the P.P.M. last night and had L.L. again.  \n\nUpdate from 4 to now 5 stars.  \nWhy?  Because of a few things which I'm going to list right now:\n\n1 - Integrity.\nWe brought our 2 mason jars back last night and were due to get a $1 off each  Luncharita.  We had asked, and the guy confirmed that it was $1 if you brought a jar back.  We sat the jars down on the table and thought nothing of it, thinking we'd get our discount.  Well I guess we didn't. When we ordered, he asked if I wanted a receipt, but I said it wasn't necessary.  The guy noticed the jars on the table when I went up to get our food and said..\"Wow, I completely forgot to give you your $2 off for the jars.\"  He handed J 2 $1.00 bills after he helped me walk our food to the table.     \n\n2 - Benevolence. \nWhile we were up at the table deciding on our order, I noticed a flier on the table.  They're donating a portion of August's sales to the Hey Joe family (cant remember the husband/wife's names) to help out with their medical costs.  Hey Joe's wife was just diagnosed with cancer.   \n\nThere truly is a great camaraderie among some of the food trucks owner/operators.    \n\nOur order last night - 2 Luncharitas, 1 Steak and Blue (super awesome), and 1 Papas con Chorizo (super awesome with great flavor/seasoning).  \n\nIf you haven't tried Luncha Libre yet...you should be beaten.. with a tortilla.","We had our first (and definitely not our last) experience with Luncha Libre at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest this past Thursday. Today is Sunday and we plan on going back to the Foodie Fest just to grab another meal from Luncha Libre.\n\nSome people think a gluten allergy is a myth, a junk allergy. I've had this allergy for many years, possibly starting when I was a baby, and it wasn't until recently that people took this allergy seriously. The guys at Luncha Libre didn't treat me like I was a pain in the butt (even though this allergy can be a pain in the butt for any restaurant/food truck), and they made me feel completely comfortable eating their food. \n\nThey only offered two dishes at the fest, and the one I could eat was angus beef mixed with chorizo and jalepenos, drizzled in maple syrup and served with tortilla chips since I could not eat the Tres Leches bun. However, my husband could eat the bun, and he looked like he was in pure heaven eating that burger. I enjoyed their salsa as well. At first it wasn't spicy, but then it crept up on you and hit a mini punch.\n\nI love good customer service and someone who doesn't make me feel like I'm a hassle, especially since I wish I wasn't one with my allergy. The next time they're at Foodie Fest or I am in AZ, I will definitely find them so I can try the other items on their scrumptious menu. Go here, get something that you can't get anywhere else right now. Salty, sweet and a little bit of spice makes your tastebuds sing, I promise! You'll love it!","Have been following these guys for awhile now on Twitter getting ready for our upcoming, now over :( vacation to Phoenix. Lucky for us we were in town for the Scottsdale Art Festival and their usual Friday stop on 7th Street in Phoenix at Urban Cookies. The months of anticipation DID NOT disappoint upon our arrival at the truck. Along with myself, my wife and kids were AMAZED by the flavor and overall size of these Quesadillas!! We tried Steak and Blue and their weekly special which was the Carne Asada I do believe along with the chips and the Luncharitas in both Horchata and Mango Pineapple, all which made for a GREAT GREAT lunch! There was a line of people which was great to see for the LL Crew and a good majority brought back their Lucharita mason jars as you get $1.00 off on your next drink when you trade in you old jar for a new one, a great way to keep the people coming, and boy that they were, the line 12-15 people deep! And most importantly the staff...they are great!! Which makes it even better...we can't wait to see them again on our next trip. If your ever in OH-IO let us know :) Thanks again and thanks for remembering our Anniversary!!","Kind of expensive. The drinks are fun and good. The food was good. Fresh salsa and chips and very flavorful quesadillas. Fairly quick service and very friendly.","My experience of eating from Luncha Libre was memorable yet foggy ...\n\nI was at a beer festival at Heritage Square last December. After a few hours of countless free beer tastings I was walking sideways and chatting up way too many strangers. My husband went on a mission to find something other than beer to fill my belly.\n\nHe comes back with a paper tray and said \"Here. Vegetarian quesadillas.\" I took a bite. 'Angels singing' ... then the heat creeped up. I started devouring it. My friends came over and started tearing pieces off like the rude, ravenous hyenas they are. I turned and ran for cover behind an abandoned beer tent and finished off my quesadillas in a dark corner. Really it was reminiscent of that \"Nature \" show on PBS. I polished them off and then proceeded to lick my fingers. By the time my husband found me I was in a happy belly trance.\n\nSo yes, I will seek Luncha Libra for some more of their delicious food. If they let me after that very un-ladylike behavior...","Luncha Libre catered my business event last evening (2/7). The food, the service, and the presentation was most excellent. My expectations were exceeded. This was a VIP event and PR was a premium for me. Luncha Libre was the hit of the evening and seemed to be a natural extension of who we represent ourselves to be.\n\nThe building management has some fairly strict policies for caterers; no problem for Lunch Libre. They are totally professional not only up front, but back behind the scenes where attention to details can make or break a deal. These people were on their \"A\" game the whole way.\n\nI highly recommend Luncha Libre and we will be calling upon them again for all of our future catered events.","Luncha Libre was one of the three food trucks available for good eats at the Adult's Night Out/Play Date at the Children's Museum.  I tried the Koreadilla ($9.50), a beef bulgolgi quesadilla with fresh jalapeno, shredded cabbage, and jack cheese.  It came with a side of salsa and chips.  The tortilla was nicely toasted.  The meat was nice and tender, and had a good amount of sauce covering it.  The sauce itself tasted too much of Hoisin sauce rather than Korean bulgolgi though, and the salsa, while cool and refreshing, was a bit bland and very mild to me.  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes for the quesadilla to be made, and there was a steady stream of customers ordering.  As for drinks, they offer a selection of sodas and water ($1 for soda).  I'd like to try more Mexican creations from them again, but probably not the Korean style items (I've been spoiled by the awesome Korean/Mexican food at KoMex Restaurant in Las Vegas).","The toasty perfection of the tortilla is what sets Luncha Libre's 'dillas apart from the rest. I had the Carne Asada 'dilla and the tort was a little charred, a little sweet and was imparted with all the flavors from the grill.   I would buy a side order of grill toasted tortilla chips if it was an option. I also had the orange blossom tea and was given a large mason jar to keep and return for refills and a buck off my future visits. Now how good is that?!\n\nMondays: Lunch at Luhr's (Alley) - Downtown Phoenix","It's not often I say this about any food.... but Luncha Libre blows me away every time. Everything I get is a new party in my mouth. Every bite is an explosion of bliss.  I know this sounds dramatic, like I'm going over the top here. Try it, I guarantee you will have the same experience. If you like it mild, it's great, but these guys turn up the heat with some of their salsas, so ask for it to burn! Luncha Libre is awesome, check them out!","Love at first bite! Papa Verde de mi corazon! \nTranslation: Green Potato (not dad, lol) of my heart! \n\nI've been stalking this food truck for a while via their location texts (you can sign up for them on their website) & had yet to be close enough to give them a try.... UNTIL I went to the Science Center and BAM!! There they were, just waiting for me :D\n\nWhen in doubt, I ask for recommendations. The guy taking my order told me his favorite quesadilla was the Papa Verde with chicken. So I said \"I'll take that!\". To tell you the truth, it looked like a common quesadilla in it's little box, but ohhhhh, sirree!!! It was anything but common! It was a burst of flavor with every bite & the potato and green chile sauce really made it awesome! \n\nThey had run out of Horchata, which I REALLY wanted to try, so I got the limeade. It was yummy! Fresh with just the right amount of sweet and tart. I also really like that it came in a mason jar :)","EDIT ok whats the deal here, you guys all afraid of food trucks for some reason? This was some of the best quesadillas I have ever had! You guys are seriously missing out if your cutting out food trucks ... Granted I dont go hunt them down, but Im always game to try em out when the opportunity presents itself!\n\nThis truck was brought in by our work. I had the \"all thai'd up\" along with the orange blossom luncharita. Both were phenomenal! Good big portion, a bit of spice to make you sniff, and some sweet honey to mellow it out. Definately would order again!!","Today I had THE BEST lunch experience ever!  I had the Steak and Bleu Quesadilla along with a Mango Coconut Luncharita. Homemade chips and pico are included.  It was very satisfying and VERY filling!  All was made by Tim Cobb and his crew at Luncha Libre Gourmet Food Truck.  Those working at the truck are funny, and yet very professional at the same time. I have been to this truck a couple of prior times.  Usually I whimp out and get a plain cheese quesadilla.  I am glad today I decided to go for it and try something different!!  Their service is always quick and quality is always 100% As a matter of fact today, my food looked so good that someone stopped me and asked me where I got my lunch!  Awesome job, Tim and crew!  Quality people making quality food. That's what you get at Luncha Libre Gourmet Food Truck!!  I now have a new favorite place to eat!","Lunche Libre ! You now found a new stalker ! I was fortunate enough to live near two schools they stopped off at the past two weeks. Both times I had the Steak and Blue quesadilla. The Carne Asada was delicious and the combination of everything in it was perfect. I've had the Aqua Frescas in the past and they are a must.","Ohhhh Luncha Libre, I love all of the wonderful, greasy, gluttonous goodness that comes out of your food truck! The food combinations are unique and delicious, with some items having a bit of a Latin/Asian fusion. The guys inside are usually incredibly busy but they're always friendly and fast. The salsa has a good kick to it and the chips are freshly made. \n\nI am always happy when I see Luncha Libre around. And I'm always happier after I eat there."],"business_id":"qXyhCYV6cjojzy5rJKooMA","name":"Luncha Libre Gourmet Food Truck","categories":["Food","Mexican","Food Trucks","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["I have no comment on food for this place since I just went there one afternoon for happy hour drinks. The place was not busy as it was 6pm on a Thursday evening. We walk in, the two hosts are standing at the podium carrying a conversation which was more than likely gossip of the drama there lol. we walk in, the host hands us two menus, continues their conversation, and points us to the dining area/ bar area. Surprising. So we walk in the direction that they pointed us to and picked a place to sit. The sangria drink was pretty gross and tasted like a virgin ( virgin drink that is). The chips and salsa were good but the server was not so good. Didn't really talk to us, he did take our order, did not inform us happy hour details and became annoyed when asked about them and told me to look at the menu. The server did not inform us as to how much time was left for happy hour out of courtesy. So some of our drinks were charged for full price due to not knowing of our time left or even offer another drink before happy hour was over. When we were ready to leave, we requested our checks and there were four of us which meant four different checks. He returns with four different pads with our checks in them and just leaves them on the table stacked and walks away- doesn't bother to personally hand them to us or even say a word. Once we all distribute our checks on our own, place our cards in them and he takes them, he returns after swiping our cards and does the same thing of placing them on the table stacked without a thank you or any word and walks away. Pretty bad service if ya ask me. Wish I could have tried the food to see if I'd enjoy it but based off the service alone, I most likely will not be returning. Bummer...","We have been here many times and I am unsure why it has a 3 star rating at this time. The good and service is always consistently great. We are always served with friendly attentive service. We have had the taco platter on several occasions and they are always so good. We have tried many other dishes on the menu and they are always great. Prices are not low-- but average for restaurants in the area. This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Goodyear/Avondale area.","I have eaten here on several occasions and like the food quite a lot. I really like the salsa.  I have had shredded beef tacos at several Mexican restaurants, and like them here best.","I enjoyed the service and food.  \n\nIf you are a fan of HOT spices, you'll want to try the roasted jalapeños.  OMG!  I pride myself in eating hot food, but this was too hot even for me.","The food was just \"ok.\" The service very underwhelming. With the sheer number of Mexican food restaurants around the Valley, there really is never a reason to eat mediocre food with mediocre service. Normally I'm a pretty generous tipper, but due to the minimum service we received, I only tipped 13% of the bill. She got back what she put out.","Four of us had dinner here and we all felt a three was a an accurate rating.  The food was OK with average flavor.  The staff was nice and addressed complaints efficiently.  One dinner was so greasy and tasteless it had to be sent back but they were very gracious.  I enjoyed my cheese enchiladas with an egg but the fish tacos were average and the chicken salad was average.  We would probably eat here again but would not crave it or trust taking guests again.","Manuel's had always served delicious food to our family for many many years,  and this location is no different.  We love the Mexican pizza and could eat nothing but their chips,  hot sauce and salsa!","These guys do a great job.  The service was good and I never had to wait long for my food or appetizers.  The mini chimichangas were great as appetizers the whole party enjoyed them.  My main meal was good for lunch.  I had the cheese enchilada.  I would definitely go again and take friends.","I like the ambiance at this restaurant.  However, the service is poor!  My sister & I  went in on Saturday, November 30 & it was not busy.  We ordered a couple of cokes & nachos.  It took over a 1/2 hour to get the nachos - when they were served to us it was served on a tiny plate.  I'm thinking really??  this is $9?  This is the 3rd time we've been there & had lousy service.  The woman who was at a table next to us had also ordered nachos & her plate was huge!  Not recommending!","Overall good service and good food. Delivered on taste and quality. The chicken and steak fajitas were tasty and the ground beef chimichanga could've had more flavor. The fried ice cream was perfect. With so many options in the area, it will be awhile before I go back simply because its good but not great.","Absolutely loved the food my husband and I had today! We both had the special. It consisted of a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. The refried beans melted in your mouth and the sauce on the enchilada was so delicious! The beef taco was tasty and fresh.\nThe service was excellent! They kept our chips and salsa bowls full and refilled our drinks when empty. Next time I am in the area, I will make it a point to come back and eat there again!","My husband and I went here for Valentine's day dinner. We saw it advertised on tv and the food looked really good. They all gave it great reviews. The food was alright. My husband had the enchilada trio and he said he really liked the shredded beef enchilada. I enjoyed my meal of spinach enchiladas.  It would have been better of the spinach was cut up smaller. I felt like I was eating a salad. The margarita was refreshing and pretty strong. We got there during happy hour so the beer was only $2.50. We finished sinner off with fried ice cream.  Oh man, that was the best part. We will be back to try something else at a later time.","I'm relocating to the west valley from OK and I was vet impressed by the food and service. Gonzalo at the bar area was extreme my accommodating and recommended that I have the three enchilada plate. It was one chicken, one spinach and one beef. The house margaritas were good too.","I was asked what I want for dinner tonight, I say Mexican. Okie Dokie then, where? I say Manuel's since we have never been, Okie Dokie then.\n\nSo we arrive and are greeting by three people and taken directly to a booth, which for me is strike number one. I hate booths my body is just not made for them. But there seems to be no tables. I assume the interior is meant to feel like an outside courtyard, it does not in the least feel as such. I am truly over the open duct work look.  But it is clean and not overpowered with music, and thank God no TV's. So we are then greeted by our waitperson, Patches. Yes her real name, I asked. Most wait persons could learn a thing or two from her, very friendly but not over familiar and patient in answering any question and making sure you understand the menu and what comes on the dish. I watched her take the same care with all of her quests, but not letting the attention delay her service.\n\nNow on to the food. I did not like the chips and salsa, to me the chips tasted like cardboard and the salsa had cilantro. I do not like cilantro and if I am aware it will be in the dish; ask that it be left out. I had the tacos with pork. I liked this a lot, the meat was tender and very flavourful the cilantro on this comes in a separate bowl. My mate had the sampler plate; he did not like the food at all. He said it had a hint of flavour and that would be the same flavour for each sample. So he was not impressed. I doubt we will be back as there are other places as close to our home we like better.","I tried this place for the first time and ordered their special on Sunday of enchiladas,eggs, and beans. My daughter ordered the taco salad. The chips and salsa arrived with a small bowl of chips and huge bowl of salsa ( very amusing). The chips had a burnt taste to them but did not appear burnt. Did not eat emm. When our plates arrived the taco salad was typical, served in the fried tostada bowl and her words were, \"it's ok\". My plate looked ok until I noticed I had only one fried egg on my plate...strange..they usually come in pairs. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she said there should be 2 and said she would get it taken care of. A few moments later she arrived with a plate with a very raw egg on it. It was not even fried...it almost looked like a poached egg...but raw.I showed our waitress and she said that it didn't like right to her either , but the cook told her to serve it to me. I was upset...with situation and asked to speak to a manager. He arrived and I explained the events and he said..\"well I didn't see the egg, so I am not sure what happened\". I assured him it was raw and he said he was sorry and that he ask the cook about it and he left. he did not offer any compensation for it and as a matter of fact the waitress is the one that gave me an employee discount. The manager did not appear to care about the situation and the cook obviously could not even cook an egg...I will not return.","It's official I can probably eat Mexican food every day.  Either for lunch or for dinner.  What else could explain two nights in a row?  \n\nAfter a little pre-vacation shopping the husband and I were hungry.  Manuel's was right in front of us and we decided to go on in.  The weather was nice so we sat outside.  The seating here is very back yard with a pool seating.  Tables made out of rod iron.  Uncomfortable chairs that are angled weirdly.  Not the most comfortable.  Our waiter came over immediately (he was the also the bartender) to take our drink order, our chips and salsa came out shortly after.  I do have to agree with the other Yelpers.  What is with the small bowl of chips?  It would behoove Manuels to get a bigger bowl so they dont have to go back and forth 20 times for more chips.  My husband dislikes onions but also likes things a little spicier.  He ordered the hot sauce and it came in even a smaller dish.  He said it tasted like \"spicy ketchup\".  He still liked it.  \n\nI ordered the Fiesta Platter.  A bunch of different things for $11.50.  It was good.  Their beans were delish.  I think that might have been my favorite thing.  The star in this dish was probably the mini pollo especial.  Several different things come out on one plate.  The pollo especial has a sauce tht they absolutely covered.  Inside is plenty of chicken.  You can see all of the big chunks left.  That was good.  It was a tad bit salty but it was good.  \n\nMy hubby ordered the # 1 combo dinner.  Red chili burro, cheese enchilada, beans.  He liked it.  If he's not talking during dinner he's into the meal.  Either that or he's just super hungry.  Our meal was good.  The wait staff was super attentive.  In a pinch it did just fine.","This review is based totally on the food, I haven't actually eaten in the reasturant, we've always had it delievered with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com or picked it up.  But the food is good.  It's not the best mexican food in the valley but it's yummy.  The only thing I don't like is it's not really consistant.  Some nights the food is fantastic some times it's meh ok.  I order the fajitas a lot I love them and they aren't the least healthy thing on the menu lol.  Some nights the are full and yummy some nights it seems like a lunch portion or something becaue it's half of what I usually get (which for me is enough for two meals).","THIS is my NEW favorite restaurant in Goodyear!  GREAT service, love the bartenders they are very attentive!  THE food is another plus. YOU won't be disappointed.","I was an attendee at a baby shower that they graciously held in their bar area... it was great to be around a bunch of drunk women and a crazy pregnant woman.\n\nThe server was very pleasant, she came back regularly to check on us and refill drinks.  We were able to order our own stuff if we wanted to or we could just eat the flautas or mini-chimi's on the table purchased by my gracious hostess sister.\n\nFlautas and mini-chimi's... you can't go wrong.  Love that stuff.","Salsa was decent, Food average.  Not bad, but I won't stop there again.  Travelling through Phoenix on our way back to Tucson and tried to find some relatively authentic Mexican food  This worked out fine, but was nothing to get excited about..","We took a family friend here for some dinner as he was traveling from New Orleans to LA. I've heard good things and I've been wanting to try it for sometime. I can only speak for the Pollo Especial I had, and it was very good. Service was good, and our server even made sure we were squeezed in at the happy hour prices. \n\nIf this were located in someplace besides the SW (say Indiana or Ohio) then I think people would be giving this 5-stars. But here in the valley, there are much more flavorful and authentic Northern Mexican places to eat.","I am giving 3 stars because I expected better Mexican in Phoenix than in Denver.  If it were in Denver, I would have given it 4 stars at least.  The frozen margarita was awesome however.  I could see if you are in Phoenix in the middle of the summer going to this place.","-Food is decent, not the best Mexican food. It's about $7.75 for a 2-item combo during lunch, no rice or beans. Taco shell was dripping with grease and the meat was room temp. That's appetizing, right?\n\n-The WORST waitress EVER!!!! We thought she was either drunk or on some sort of drugs! We tipped the bus boy instead. It was too late to ask for a different Food Server...we were stuck with her. \n\n-Waitress told us she was going to clear off dishes at another table and will be back to take our order, even after we were sitting there waiting already for 10 minutes and told her we WERE ready to order....we saw her chatting with another table. Who does this?\n\n-The Busboy acted more professional than the Food Server. She was \"in-your-face\" patronizing, rather a very \"fake friendly\", and acted like someone who had been drinking, it was really uncomfortable.\n\n-Chips and salsa were good.\n\n-Not a good value for the price/portion.\n\n-Hostess was friendly. \n\n-I would NEVER eat here again, esp since there are so many other choices for Mexican food in the Valley.","Very slow service, seems the employee that provides chips and salsa upon arrival was on break.  When the server finally greeted us, she said he'll be back soon, but didn't offer to bring some herself.  Food was delivered same time as complimentary chips.  The waitress never came back for drink refills until she brought the check.  We had to raid an empty table for a place setting as we were shorted.\nThe food was less than average but not awful.  Average value but leaning to slightly over priced.\nIn my opinion there are several Mexican restaurants in the vicinity I would choose over this one in a heart beat.","Nothing to write home about but will do for an average meal.  Salsa was good.  Meal was average and service uninspired. At least we beat the dinner rush so there wasn't a wait.","Delicious Mexican food, have great service and sometimes on the weekends they have live music.  Good place to come relax and watch a game or listen to music.","Love it! We go there about once a month. Sometimes we'll get a below average waitress, but for the most part we are well taken care of. Love the chips and salsa & the green chili burritos. The taco salad isn't great.","12/26 dinner. Very very long wait for food..service was poor. Our server~Heather wasn't pleasant or friendly to say the least.","My wife and I really enjoyed the food and the salsa. We also had very good service and did not experience any of the negative things that I had seen on Yelp. That being said, I have to mark them down because their prices are absurd! It's Mexican food- tortillas, chicken, beans, and cheese... You can't charge me $13 for that! That is more than my steak, salad, and side at Outback... Twice the price of a meal at Costa Vida (which is a Mexican grill in the same strip mall)!","I cannot believe how bad the food was here.  Lets start with the salsa, terrible.  It tasted like some peppers and tomatoes mixed with store purchased Pace salsa.  The appetizers of Chicken Nachos where soggy from the second they hit the table.  My wife order Shrimp fajitas, that arrived just warm and not sizzling on the plate like they should be.  I ordered a Chimichanga that was so bland and dry I could only eat a quarter of it.  Even my daughter could not eat her bean and cheese burrito because she said it was so dry.\n\nAfter a $71 lunch bill ??? I still cannot believe it was that much, I will NEVER go back to this place again.  How they are still in business I have no idea, as I've had a better burrito's at Taco Bell.","My family went to this restaurant on a Saturday night . Walking in and seeing how vacant the place was should have been a sign to walk away. My family was seated promptly and the service was ok, One of the dishes ordered contained shrimp. The shrimp was horrible! It was tough and not fresh. The shrimp tasted as if it was cooked without being defrosted. The waiter was informed of how horrible the meal was. He took it back with the food still on the plate. \nWe asked to see the Manager and after multiple request it took over 15 minutes for him to arrive. When we informed of the meal he said there was nothing he could do and would not refund the meal. The way he handled the situation was very unprofessional and rude. He then took out his phone and showed us a photo of the plate and it showed the whole plate cleaned off which it wasn't! This manager was horrible and should never run a restaurant. He was very unprofessional and I would never go there again!","We stopped by for dinner on Friday night and the place was packed. When we walked in the sitting area was full of people waiting. Since we decided to sit in the bar we were able to get a table right away. \nI am not sure if this was a good or a bad thing. Our drink order was taken fairly quickly and our chips and salsa arrived promptly. The chips were so-so and the salsa was unusual but we decided we liked it. I ordered a margarita which I did not think was very good.  It took a while for the waiter to make it back to take our order but that was nothing compared to the time it took for our food to come out. My husband ordered some type of casserole so maybe that took a little longer to cook or something but wow!  Once our food arrived I was a little disappointed to find out that my chile Rellano was wrapped in egg instead of fried but other than that it was ok. My hubby's casserole was also ok. Like the other reviewers the food is decent, not the best mexican food we have had. \nIt also seemed like the more the place cleared out the better the service was. \nIn all this was much better and cheaper then Arriba Grill down the road and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We will probably give it another try on a less crowded night.","The service was terrible - the food was not much better. We waited forever for our drink orders, but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because our kids had to get milk from the bar. When we had to get the chip guy to refill our drinks, I knew it was no fluke. \n\nWe then pulled up the Yelp reviews and read all about what we were living at that moment. But as we hasn't gotten our food yet, we still had to wait. \n\nI was full of chips and water, so I wasn't  able to finish main course. The only reason I took it home was because I was taught as a child not to waste food. \n\nWon't be back-ever. Wasn't all  bad, but with so many good restaurants within a couple of miles, eating here would be a waste of time and money.","My first time coming to Manuel's and was really disappointed. The waitress/bartender was really slow, they're usually quick about bringing you chips a dip, took approx. 10 min. I ordered the red Chimichanga. enchilada style, with red sauce, she brought it with green sauce, when I told her about the mistake, her fix was to bring a side of the red sauce... Not good customer service. I had an Arnold Palmer to drink, she never offered to refill it until I asked for the check. Now don't get me wrong, 1 bad day does not break this place for me. This waitress/bartender just needs to pick up her game if she's going to be successful here.","I loved the salsa. My shrimp tacos were just okay. Next time I'll try something else.. The fried ice cream was fantastic!","I have never eaten here before, and I will NOT do it again. I ordered veggie fajitas. It came with zucchini, onions, corn and some kind of spicy red pepper. It was utterly flavorless aside from heat from the pepper. I don't think they even added salt/pepper. These were seriously the worst fajitas I have ever had. It comes with corn or flour tortillas. I had flour and they were good. It came with tomatillo salsa which was meh. The only thing I enjoyed aside from the tortillas were the refried beans. \n\nTalk about a waste of 12.75. I would have been better off at Chipotle.","After moving to Buckeye from a small town with nothing but sub-par Mexican restaurants I swore I would never eat at another Mexican place again. Of course we were taken to Manuels for a \"thank you\" dinner from some friends. The 4 of us were immediately seated and after a short time got a hot bowl of chips. Now was my chance to try a fish taco. Nope, never had one and never wanted to spend money and not like it. This was a great  I must say!. Not battered or fried but grilled. The bummer was I chose the corn tortilla and was embarassed to try and eat the the darn thing coming apart due to steaming it. Nothing short of shoving it in my mouth made it possible to eat. I also looked like a slob because they don't give spoons so it was too messy trying to get more then 5 pieces of rice on my fork without it falling all over the place. Can't really rate the taste.  My husband and I returned for a lunch date and got there when it first opened. Kinda wierd that the chips weren't warm like the first time. Got the chicken taco salad and since I can't eat sour cream and wasn't going to eat the fried tortilla bowl I realized there's not much chicken in that dish. I got a heck of alot of lettuce though (I left a little hungry) We did have nice service both times and I did catch a cute (private) moment coming from the ladies room. One of the waiters was quietly whispering I love you to one of the waitress. They were embarassed when I tried to walk past unnoticed. Not the greatest place but I will go back as it's clean and I love the fish tacos.","Don't go to Manuels... food is BLAND ,then don't ask for anything extra like 2 tiny plastic cups of green sauce,,, $2.00. Frys has 8oz for $1.00.Taco bell is much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","The service was very sweet and well-meaning, so as an experience where I sit still in an air-conditioned space and people bring me stuff, this was fine.\n\nThe stuff... not so fine. Let's get the party started with... stale chips. I am also skeptical that the sangria contained any alcohol at all. While I'm grateful to have not had a buzz on with a drive home, if I'd wanted alcohol-free fruit juice, I would have stopped at Fry's for a quart of cran-grape and paid less than the $6.50 that went with a small glass of mostly ice.\n\nThe steak fajitas consisted of a great mass of caramelized onion and seven small strips of the most gristly steak I've ever encountered. The fajita strips I buy at the supermarket are openly \"meat leftovers we can't sell otherwise,\" and they have less gristle. I seriously worried about pulling a tooth loose while trying to bite through these and had to give up on wrapping the fajita fillings in tortillas, which is kind of the gist of the fajita experience.\n\nOr not, since only two tortillas are provided. Do not look to the guacamole for flavor; it could well be the shortening-and-green-coloring kind sold at the supermarket.\n\nOh, and the free wi-fi wasn't connected to the internet. Um, what's the point of wi-fi,then?\n\nI went into Manuel's thinking \"I'll be adventurous, I'll support local business, I remember having really good food for cheapish at a Manuel's right after I moved to Phoenix.\" I left feeling that the proprietors were laughing at people like me for paying $15 an entree for food that doesn't measure up to most people's home leftovers.\n\nThat's the last time I impulsively stop at a restaurant before checking Yelp, as any number of people could have warned me."],"business_id":"rjm5zAnCJ8Cxg0wb1CxtMg","name":"Manuel's Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["For many years, I was resistant to the idea of fish tacos. Little did I know what I was missing! 8 years ago, I decided to try them at Rubio's and I've never looked back! On this particular visit, I redeemed my free birthday meal, which is a perk of signing up for their email notifications. Consistently good food every time I visit!","Love the fact they have a low carb wrap! I will forever drive by the \"Chip\" place I used to know so well..\n\nKeep up the good work!!","I have only come to this location once but I was blown away! Great, friendly staff, awesome food and their fish tacos are to die for. They have them half off I believe on Thursdays.","I alway enjoy this place. Great food. Head over after 2:00 pm on Tuesday and have fish tacos for $1.50 each. Enjoy","We came here on a whim and it was surprisingly tasty! My husband had some kind of shrimp tacos with bacon (it was good, I don't think you can go wrong with shrimp and bacon) and I had the beer-battered fish tacos with avocado and corn and some kind of tasty sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed everything except maybe the rice, but the chips and variety of salsa were really good! After checking the nutritional info, I feel slightly scandalized, but not so scandalized that I won't go back, haha.","Rubios is one of my favorites, its got a great atmosphere, super nice employees, and its great if you're a pescatarian like me. Rubios offers a lot of choices.","My hubby and I ate the lobster tacos really great!!","I don't care what people say, but there are some chains that I love, and Rubios is one of them.  I love their original fish tacos.  I don't care for anything else on the menu.\n\nAnd anyone who hates on eating in chain restaurants... I DARE you to come to Rubios.  Original taco plate, and substitute the beans for rice.  Yea, ... I said it!  I'm done here, you need to know nothing else.","love the flavors .fresh and anuthentic","I've stopped by this Rubio's quite a few times. Strangely enough it is probably the furthest Rubio's from where I live here in the valley. But I do have a friend who lives close by and if I'm in the area it is always nice to stop in and grab some tacos.\n\nI like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.\n\nThe chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar. \n\nLastly, this Rubio's is clean, the employees were very nice to me and my mother (and made sure my mother did not get any guac in her meal). Overall, Rubio's is still a fave of mine, especially this location.","I have a habit of finding a food location, eating everything on the menu everyday for over a month, then getting sick of it all, and that is yet to happen here! First off I love fish, and fish is their speciality, so the relationship is now mutual. Getting a delicious Ono Burrito after a hard workout at the gym is a great pick me up. They have your typical steak and chicken burrito options if your not in the mood for fish, and these are also great. There is alway some new flavor on the menu to try. There food items are not swimming in grease so you wont feel like you swallowed a lead ball when your finished chowing down. If its your first time I recommend the Blackened Ono Burrito. If you want some shrimp, give the Mesquite shrimp burrito a go. This location is next to Whole foods on lake mead off the 95 exit.\n\nOh, comes stocked with a salsa bar as well. Grab a churro and enjoy!","I'm addicted to the Street Tacos! They are really yummy. I am sad I hadn't tried this place before but will now be back for sure. I got  the 3-plate combo so I got to pick from 3 tacos (chicken, steak or carnitas) and it came with rice and beans. I was able to mix-n-match the tacos so I picked one of each to try them all. They were all good but the carnitas was my favorite. \n\nInside is clean and the staff is super friendly. If you sign up on their e-mail list (beach club) you get a nice coupon to go towards the cost of your purchase on your birthday! They also send other promotions. Rubio's also offers catering and fundraising services.","Mother of God this place is GOOD.!!  I can not express....how amazing the staff was. \nAmber and Rachael were great!  One of them went  next door for a drink that they did not have because the machine was out.  Food was yummy, hot and fresh!  Try it!","I love Rubio's. I've never had a complaint at any of their locations. Clean restaurants. Good food. Friendly employees. Amber at this location is especially friendly and goes out of her way to ensure your experience is top notch. \nTheir Tuesday fish taco deal is awesome. $1.50 after 2:30 pm.","Went here based on yelp reviews. The server was great very helpful with menu choices. Had fish taco trio it was delicious and filling. Also tried the chicken salad and chicken quesadilla. They were all delicious. Clean and pleasant atmosphere.","We love this place and eat there often. It has fresh food, is consistant and very clean. The staff is very friendly and gets to know its customers. So far, our best place to eat in our area!  The girls that work there have become like friends to us, Amber and Vanba especially.  We ate there again last night and again we were pleased.  You always leave there full and content!\nWe always wind up going back there.  We highly recommend this Rubio's to anyone looking for a good meal in a friendly, clean environment.\n~Eileen and John~","Wow! I was so very pleasantly surprised with this place!\n\nI had the Mahi Mahi burrito. There was delightfully flaky mahi mahi, rice, roasted corn, red onions, guacamole all wrapped in a delight flour tortilla. The serving seemed bigger than my head and came with tortilla chips that were perfectly crispy and sensationally salted. I sampled each salsa from the bar and have decided that the tomatillo is the one for me. I absolutely love that they have Vanilla Coke 'on-tap'. \n\nWe will absolutely be back for more. :)","I have not been to a Rubio's in years because I was not a fan of the menu. I am glad that I returned. I love that my food was brought to the table. The condiments bar is a nice place to add some more flavor to your meal. Food was light and filling. I didn't feel heavy and overstuffed afterwards. A big step up from other \"Mexican\" fast food places.","This place has great food and the friendly staff is the best! Fish tacos were great.","I have just recently discovered Rubio's and my belly is happy for it! Here's why: \n\n1.The food is tasty and high quality. \n\n2. Huge selection of food, so everyone in your party will be happy for sure.\n\n3. The prices are reasonable for what you receive.\n\n4. The staff is extremely friendly.\n\n5. Salsa bar!  The salsas are all yummy and you can have as much as you like.  \n\nWhat's not to like? If you like Mexican food and want to try something new, check out Rubio's!","Their service is the best.\nTheir staffs are  very attentive and good energy.\nFood is very fresh and delicious.\nQuite clean.\nSeems Surfer friendly.\nWe love to come here with my kids.\nKids loves the kids menu.","I love the greeting I get at Rubio's. My order is always correct and tastes great. The manager on during the day shift is pleasant and knows my name now. Love the chicken tortilla soup.","I came here last night with Donald for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos after 2pm). There were quite a bit of people dining inside since they had the special going on, but there wasn't any line at all, so we got our food right away. We ordered 3 fish tacos each, which was more than enough since they were pretty big, and a small fountain drink for only $12.26. Now that was a cheap dinner! The fish was cooked well and the cabbage was fresh. The only thing I didn't really like was the corn tortillas because they were pretty thick and broke easily, but that wasn't a big deal. i just wish there was a Rubios closer to my side of town!","they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!","My Mom loves the food, and they have Lobster right now! Getting my grub on, then hoping my headache goes away.\n The workers went WAY out of their way for us, even running next door because they were out of the drink my Mom wanted!\n The food was excellent, and the place was spotless. The decor is quirky, and there is always seating.\n I have never left hungry, and even though I think it's pricey it is always worth it once I get there.","when it comes to fast food that tastes good, too.  rubio's is a great catch  absolutely love the blackened talapita taco.  it's a reel keeper!.\nthe employees are always pleasant and e-fish-nt.\ni'm hooked.","bomb ass street tacos forever fresh, enuff said!","Food and staff are always awesome! Gourmet steak tacos are my favorite!","I come to Rubio's for one thing, the herb garlic shrimp tacos with bacon. I was craving these and I was on this end of town so I stopped by. This Rubio's has great seating (inside and out) and super friendly service. They were also sampling food options as you waited for your food. How awesome is that?!","Not bad. Not amazing or anything but not bad. \nThe good: \nvery friendly service\nfish tacos!\ntortilla chicken soup was pretty awesome\nThey have vanilla coke!\nThe not so good:\nMy chicken burrito.. I can't remember which one I ended up going with, had tons of quac in it.. I like guac, but I couldn't taste anything else in the burrito. So meh.\nWasn't really impressed with the salsa. I love spicy salsa, but I also want it to have more flavor than JUST the pepper.\nProbably will return for more of that tasty soup and taco. :)","Yippee!!!  Veggie tacos are back!!  How can you not love portobello and poblano grilled on a corn tortilla with grilled cheese and then add chipotle white sauce, rice and a squeeze of lime-sooooo goooood.\n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I discovered Rubio's about 3 years ago and for about 2 years I was there every friday for lunch.  I could walk in and they would ring up my very specific order right down to the extra chipotle on the side.  It is very nice to see great service like this place.  Fish tacos are great,  guacamole is awesome!\n\nPeople will say, \"oh, it's like Baja Fresh,\" and I will kindly say \"no, it's way better!\"","This was my 2nd visit to a Rubio's....this one is in my neighborhood.  My 1st experience with Rubio's was great and I was hoping this one would be good too.  I was right!\n\nI ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans ($6.29).  It came out shortly and I went to the Salsa Bar to get their Spicy Salsa....it has some pretty good heat and I enjoy the flavor a lot.  The Burrito was very good and satisfying.\n\nI'm glad I found this chain and that there's one near my house!\n\nReturn Factor - 80%","I've been coming here since I heard of $1.25 fish taco Tuesdays and every Tuesday has been the same routine: get out of work, call Rubio's, order 3 flour fish tacos, and pick em up on my way to choir practice.  Every time I call and tell them my name, Jesus always recognizes me when I come to pick them up. Jesus brings back the comfort of being a regular at your favorite place and he always make that exception of ringing me as soon as I wall through those doors. Thumbs up for Jesus and the staff at Rubio's on Lake Mead! Happy eating! :)","Steak burrito especial was delicious. Perhaps it was the location (lake mead) or the fact that it was free. But kudos to Rubios for using this promotional opportunity to dish out some good stuff. Fast food Tex Mex done right.","Someone had to twist my arm to come here and I'm glad they persuaded me. Surprisingly yummy and cheap fish tacos. \nI'm told Rubio's brought the fish taco to the US.","Always fast and friendly service here. I mostly go for Taco Tuesdays. There is never a long wait to order or to get your food. Place is clean, salsa bar is always neat and well stocked. I love sitting outside when it's warm, overall a good casual place to relax and have some tasty grub."],"business_id":"s3u1ET2VN9NkY0qsn9gSwQ","name":"Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["The grilled veggie burrito was decent, the salsas thick and delicious.  My criticism would be the yellow cheese in the quesadilla.  I don't think they claim to be authentic, however yellow cheese is a no no in my book.  I would have given it 4 stars however it was cramped, uncomfortable and cold inside...That is a fast food restaurant trick to get ya in and out quick..I guess they don't want customers hanging around too long.  Overall I would go back but I would take my meal home and eat in a more hospitable environment.","Wife got Mahi mahi burrito and I got burrito especial with steak and everything was excellent.","What?! This is a fast food restaurant?! Wow... just wow. \n\nFirst of all, when I think of fast food Mexican I think of Taco Bell... I'm sure that doesn't ring (no pun intended) too well. In fact, most would say Taco Bell is completely disgusting. I wouldn't go that far, but it's clearly fast food. \n\nI was more than pleasantly surprised to walk in and be greeted by an incredibly clean looking and smelling place. Furthermore, the manager on duty who took our order was friendly, helpful and more than accommodating. My wife and I can be pretty picky when it comes to certain types of food, Mexican especially... boy were we pleased with the outcome of this side trip. \n\nWould I go here again? Absolutely. Would I go out of my way to go here again? That's debatable. But even now just thinking about the fish tacos... my mouth watered. \n\nYum!","Yummy Yummy Yummy.  My fav is the grilled shrimp burrito & the fish tacos.  Service is always good here which is nice.  Great choice for a quick meal.","Seriously. This is the best rubios ever.\n\nThe workers are amazing. Every time, and I mean every time I'm greeted by a friendly, \"hello welcome to rubios.\" I'm helped promptly, and the food comes fast.\n\nI come every Tuesday after 230p for the tacos at 1.5. And I add a chips and guacamole for 1 dollar more! \n\nThe place is spotless clean, salsas are consistently fresh and delicious, and I love the food. \n\nRecommended for your fish or Mexican food needs.","Extremely clean facilities. Management was seen doting on the facility's cleanliness and the patrons' well-being. Perhaps the tastiest Rubio's meal I've had, though I may have just been extra hungry. Basic shrimp taco is quite tasty.","This is definitively a find. We moved from Chicago over the summer and it has been hard to find really good restaurants. The food here was delicious!!! My kids are super picky and they maxed the kids meal taquitos and Mexican rice. My husband had the lobster langostino burrito and the surf and turf tacos and there were no leftovers. I had the mango chipotle Mahi Mahi tacos and they were delicious. I also had the shrim and salsa verde tacos and the shrimp salad and they were both really tasty! Will def. order from here again!","It's a great taste on the fish tacos! And I'm from Ensenada where the fish tacos born!","First time I had the grilled shrimp taco...it has bacon! Yum. Now its gonna be tough to pick...do I want original fish or gourmet grilled shrimp taco? Um...both! \nGreat workers, clean location.","Personally this is my favorite taco place to eat period! Try the gourmet shrimp taco and the salsa verde shrimp, these 2 are my favorite but honestly u cant go wrong with anything on their menu....also the customer service is unbeatable!","I had the steal burrito especial. The price was a little more then I would have liked.\nA little to small for that price but, it was still good. \nThe place was clean and the staff was acceptable. \nI would have to say that this 2nd place to Phat Phranks but, its still not bad. \nTry it at least once if you're in the area.","I never met a Rubio's I didn't like.  I think I've been to every Rubio's in town. Usually getting fish tacos...yum. I'm addicted. \nThis location had friendly workers, it was clean and food delicious as always.\nAnd it was $1.50 taco Tuesday! Yay!","Original fish taco... OUTSTANDING!!!!  Gourmet Shrimp Taco... TO DIE FOR (get the bacon on it, it comes with it.  Staff was great too.   So why no five stars???  Salsa bar was boring, beans were just OK, and grilled Mahi Mahi taco was just good.  But I've been there 3 times in the past month!!!!","YES, STAFF WAS GREAT!!!!  The food was great, I had the:\n\nOriginal cripsy fried fish taco: outstanding, crispy and tasty!!!!\n\nGourmet shrimp taco: orgasmic, what flavor!!!!  I wanted more!!!!\n\nMahi mahi taco: very good for being healthy, LOL, needed the green slasa!\n\nI can not wait to go back!!!  Best 10 bucks I spent in a long time!","A vegan shouldn't have to bite into his specially ordered, non-dairy, bean burrito to discover he has been fed cheese. \nAnd the manager should do a little more than offer a free coke to apologize for lacing lunch against a customers number 1 moral tenement.\n\nAccidents happen.  We all understand.  It's the way you deal with accident that separates the good establishments from the bad ones.  \n\nThanks for the free coke... \n\nGreat job making amends!!!","Rubio's are a dime a dozen in California, especially in San Diego where it originated from.  Lived there most of my life and I got sick of Rubio's.  Well, now I rediscovered them here.  I was recently in the area for something quick.  It was going either be Aloha's Kitchen, Thelma's, or Rubio's.  Aloha's Kitchen wasn't open, even though it was after 10 AM.  I wasn't in the mood for Flip food at Thelma's.  So, I settled for Rubio's. \n\nI wasn't disappointed with my eats.  I ended up getting 4 Chicken Street Tacos and for good measure, an extra side of chopped chicken breast.  Let's start with the tacos, these were good.  I was a little disappointed with how small they are.  Real street tacos aren't even this small.  But at least they aren't as small as Nacho Daddy's street tacos.  Because they were small, 4 was needed.  It's cheap so I'm not complaining.  I was actually satisfied with my 4 chicken street tacos, but needed that additional protein so I got an side of extra chicken.  The chicken was a bit dry when you have nothing with it, but it's all about the macros at this point. \n\nI tend to frequent chicken grills like T-Boy, Samurai Sam's, and TMAD lately.  But discovered that Rubio's sells chopped chicken breast on it's own too.  You know what that means, I'm adding them to my list fast food healthy eats.\n\nPro Tip:\n-Best fish tacos for a fast food joint\n-Their nachos with chicken, cheese, and sour cream is a must try\n-Addicting Chipotle sauce here\n-Their steak street tacos are my favorite\n-Great service at this location.","Talk about this Rubio's in particular...\n\nNow we all know Rubio's food is great and their fish tacos are awesome. But this location in Henderson has some of the nicest staff of any place I have ever been to. I came here today with my husband to redeem my $7 Birthday Meal Coupon. I was greeted happily and all of the staff said \"Happy Birthday!\" to me. \n\nThe place is always super clean. The salsa bar is always stocked. The food is always good. The staff must be loving their jobs because their happiness does not seemed forced. \n\nThis is definitely my go-to Rubio's out of all the ones in the Valley.","Come here a couple times a month. LOVE the fish Tacos. Simply the Best!!","I love this location! The service is amazing and the tacos and guacamole are delicious!","Yum the place is clean. The employees were helpful and understanding that this was my first time in. They help me select a dish to my taste and it was wonderful. I'm proud to say upon my next visit I will try the fish tacos. You have got to try this place.","Yummy fish tacos mmmm!","Always great fish tacos. Grilled gourmet shrimp is my perennial favorite. The staff here is exceptionally friendly and personable. This is our favorite place to eat as a family (2 kids under 5).","As far as healthier options of fast food go, this place definitely delivers. The service was very friendly and helpful. We had salmon burrito and the blackened ono burrito..between the two the ono was better, but both were very flavorful and tasty. The prices are reasonable and the menu features many different options.","$1.50 is an excellent deal for a quality fish taco on Tuesdays. The fish comes out really crispy, so you'd better eat it at the restaurant to avoid loss of texture. Make sure to squeeze that lime onto the fish and throw in something from the salsa bar (four mild and not-so-mild options). You can have as few or as many as you'd like, so come here for either a late afternoon snack or a filling dinner.\n\nAlso, I've had a burrito especial and a baja burrito, both with steak. Probably enjoyed the burrito especial more, but they were both nice. The burrito is not as huge as Chipotle's burritos, and I definitely miss the corn salsa, but it's still yummy and comes with chips. I suppose it's a better portion size if you're not looking to stuff yourself at lunch.\n\nFinally, the parking is always nice since they're in a small portioned-off strip mall with nothing else that's any good.","Lately, I've been visiting many Mexican eateries, fast food, authentic, chain restaurants, you name it. It's one of my food phases I go through. \n\nThis month, that phase is tacos. I'll have to say Rubio's Grill Gourmet Taco with Garlic Herb Shrimp was awesome. The blackened Ono taco, not so much. I'm sure having a fried fish taco would have sufficed, but I gave it a try. Not surprisingly, fish was pretty dry. I can't dock too many points, though, it's hard to expect good grilled fish from a chain, no offense. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and very efficient. The store is kept clean, and of course I always love their salsa bar. I think this store is probably well run compared to other Rubio's.\n\nI'll be back for more tacos till my cravings subsides...","Oh my gosh... Why is it that I've lived in Vegas for almost two years and have never tried Rubio's?  This morning we wanted to try something new but stay fairly close to home.  We searched on yelp for nearby restaurants and decided upon Rubio's.\n\nWe both ordered the gourmet steak taco plate.  Yeah yeah, I know they're famous for fish tacos.  I'm not a fish fan.  So sue me.  My tacos were a-mazing.  Soft tortillas, tender steak, GREAT salsa.  The staff were friendly and the place was spotless.  My favorite were the pinto beans... I loved the cotija cheese on top... Gave the beans a little extra zip.  \n\nWe used to frequent Chipotle and Baja Fresh, but I don't see us going back there as often now that we found Rubio's.  Maybe, just maybe, I will try a fish taco someday...\n\n*EDIT:  Now I've officially tried the cajun fish taco.  I'm in love!","Fresh Mexican food but fast and Good prices.  Always tasty!","Never did I ever think I'd give a ~fast food~ place 5 stars but this place totally deserves it. I was over at Sam Boyd for something, looking for lunch on my phone when I saw a solid set of Yelp reviews for this location. I went, and the kid at the counter ran me through everything on the menu, his favorites, his suggestions. I ignored all of them (sorry, I'm an idiot plant-eater) and went with the portobello & poblano tacos. To my surprise my meal came with 2 sides (rice and beans were my picks, duh) and it was all way delish. I stood around for a minute and the kid was like, \"have a seat, I'll bring it over to you.\" What even??","While I've never been disappointed by any Rubio's location, this is by far my favorite.  The staff here is amazing.  They provide exceptional service and are always very helpful with any questions I may have.  The food is always good.  Perfect size portions (not too small or too big), great variety, and a great salsa bar. \n\nIf you are looking for a good place to eat at a reasonable price, this is the place to go.","Fish Taco Tuesdays!!!  Never been to a Rubio's before and I heard that they do $1.50 tacos on Tuesdays so I decided to stop in with some friends to test it out.  The tacos are awesome, come out real quick, and Rubio's has a full salsa/condiment bar to add some extra sauce, onions, peppers, etc. to your taco mix.  The staff is always friendly when we stroll by on Tuesdays and they even offer to take your trash for you even before you leave.  Andddd service is almost always with a smile... very nice to look forward to on Tuesdays.","I put you to the test, you really are the best\nThere are miles of smiles and the food is great \nI hardly even have to wait!","I contemplated between steak street tacos and a steak burrito. The street tacos were fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and light. It came with a side of refried beans covered in cheese. They were yummly. But if your hungry go with the burrito. Lots of fresh menu options and I will be back.","I was having a terrible day.. I decided to go to rubio's for the first time, i walked in saw the menu and almost walked right back out because i was looking for the dollar menu section... so glad i didn't.  Rubio's has the best mexican food i have ever had outside of california, and even then it would give some of those restaurants a run for their money.  you can taste the freshness, the quality, and the time they put into their recipes.  i had a big burrito, and the manager gave me a gourmet taco on the house... the taco was the best taco i have ever had, and the burrito was up there too.  so the food is worth the money, also, i ate a pound of food, but i dont feel like i ate a pound of food, most places i go eat at i need to take a nap after the meal, i actually feel better after rubios than i did before i went in.  \n\ncustomer service was amazing also, got my food before i was even done getting the salsa for it, and it wasnt cold like you would normally expect your food to be when it arrives that fast.\n\nI will be eating at rubios often from now on, i recommend everyone do the same","Rubio's, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\n\n1. I have never been to a Rubio's that did not serve me delicious, hot, fresh food.\n\n2. The Famous Fish Tacos are absolutely amazing. I have had them all kinds of ways, grilled, blackened, different types of fish, even the fried ones are great.\n\n3. Prices are decent for what you're getting and since it is a step-up from typical \"fast food\" it is to be expected.\n\n4. Salsa bar!\n\n5. Even the rice and beans always come out hot and tasty, some places can get their side dishes all wrong, but not Rubio's!","Let me just say I first tried Rubio's in San Diego Co. where the Rubios I visited the most was down the road from their corporate office on Yarrow Rd. where they hold the taste testings..and they give you 3 gift cert. for $7.00 each. Can't beat that! I've tried all kinds of Rubios up & down san diegos coast and I never liked the veggie tacos.. till I ordered them @ the sunset location. It was so good it was even better than the gourmet shrimp - - which  is my most recent fav.. right behind the fish taco especial .. which the best one was on Sycamore/ Hwy 78. I'm not a fan of the chipotle salsa but I love the green and the Hot salsa. and even the mild. my only thing is the salsa is kinda runny - compared with Baja Fresh's Salsa.. but I prefer the food @ Rubios.. so I alternate btwn the 2. they are right across from ea. other This one is right outside sunset station and baja fresh is inside the galleria mall ring circle. If you are in the area.. these are must trys.","A huge fan of the Fish Taco's but the service was crazy good. (Never experienced this in a fast food restaurant ever.)\nThe Manager Sean was by far the coolest...not only did he ask what we liked to help us get a better taste of what Rubio's had to offer beside there fish taco's but also made us a special sample to try...(FREE). Never before have I seen or experienced such service.\nIf you go there, I would ask for Sean....","I have always been a fan of Rubios, especially their lobster burritos they have a few times of the year.  Unfortunately, the last time I ate at this Rubios I am pretty sure I got a bad batch of something because I was ill for the next couple of days.  Hopefully they get things worked out.","First time here and the food is wonderful. Great flavors, made fresh to order. This place is a great find!!","Rubios honestly has the potential for great fast food. The shrimp and fish tacos are pretty good by fast food standards, and the Langostino Lobster tacos are pretty tasty. However, I cannot justify spending so much on so little. The portions are very small for the money, and the fish does not taste fresh. So while I will say the food is decent - the pricing is not. \n\nAs far as service, the staff seems friendly and helpful, as long as you don't advise them that your order is wrong. They seem confused at that point.","Can hardly find fish in fish tacos. Long John silver's at least has some fish in their fish tacos. Will not return. They did try to bring something else. Chicken burrito. It was ok at best.","Your ad says you close in one minute I still don't have my order from two hours ago where is it?  I waited 3 hours and their third party delivery service never showed up and no one seemed to care.","First time at Rubio's and we were so impressed! Love the fish tacos concept. We ordered every single fish taco on the menu along with their shrimp taco and burritos. I like my fish seasoned with their blackened seasoning. My boyfriend thought the burritos were good but a bit too heavy.\n\nIf you want something light and refreshing, go their their fish tacos! We even recommended this place to a few friends already!","I've been to this Rubio's several times and never had a bad experience. This time I tried the pan seared shrimp enchilada combo. It was delicious. Usually I have the 2 fish taco especial plate. So far I've only had seafood entrees and they've all been great. The staff is always very friendly. I just wish they were open later.","I love rubios. I think I'm there 3 time a week. Well I work in the same complex. Since I gave up meat for 40 days for lent, I discovered rubios.  I fell in love with the salsa verde shrimp tacos. Its pretty cheap and awesome service.","I enjoyed my $7 birthday meal of grilled gourmet shrimp tacos with rice & beans and only paid $1 something. Rubio's gets kudos for their e-mail club with this awesome birthday deal. \nThe grilled shrimp tacos come with bacon, avocado and a yummy white sauce. Add picante salsa and it's the best meal ever! The restaurant is clean, service is fast and they serve consistently fresh and tasty food."],"business_id":"sJygoiagLWj4ci0BWZkcgA","name":"Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill","categories":["Seafood","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["This was the worse place to order burritos. The lady didn't even care and had no concerns. I can't believe this place has 4 STARZ!","Really, no stars! I ordered a chimichanga for pick up close to closing. I mentioned I would like sour cream and guacamole as well. I expected a possible charge for sc and guacamole, then again I've other places that already provides it part of the meal. Anywho, I arrive to only having to wait 3-5 min. I lived 5 min. Away, not bad! When I received my meal to go, of course I checked  for the guacamole and sour cream to no avail. I politely inquired of absence of side condiments. This is where it gets interesting. I had already checked the receipt and it was charges for .99 twice ( guacamole and sc) the cashier stated it was inside of the chimi. So I did what anyone else who knows what to do in this situation unless you don't care or know how much you love guacamole and sc! After I cut into it and saw the very minimal amt. of condiments I was charged $2 for, I proceeded to ask for more and I would pay the difference of what they supposedly already given me ( so little, couldn't tell). Granted the prices of 4 oz. containers of guacamole and sc were $1.99 and $1.15 respectively. This is where drew the line... They said they couldn't/wouldn't do it and would have to charge me for the 2 condiments? After minutes of trying to explain the the logic of just giving me what THEY thought was fair amounts extra for what I was WILLING to pay the difference for ($1 for guacamole and $.15 for sour cream) the cashier and waitress both said no can do! Even after she/they went to the back, I guess to confirm, they came back with the same answer. So already knowing I just should've asked for a refund. I made it simple for them and suggested they just back what gave me or trash and make me a fresh 1 with the condiments on the side in its respectful sized containers. (At this point I was damn, I shouldn't let them make me another, for those who know about some food workers/ handlers who are asked to remake something...) plus, too much time had passed with all the back n forth rhetoric and food was getting cold. Well after they refused to make another, even after cashier consulted with someone on the phone about the situation for literally 5 min. Before I ultimately made the right decision and politely asked to don't worry any further and just refund my monies. All $8 and some change which she acted like she was ruluctant to do. After receiving my refund, I simply rode my motorcycle across the parking lot to EL POLLO LOCO. Damn I was wanting a chimi chimi... If you don't know, don't piss of a possible loyal customer (any for that matter!)","Mexican restaurant? And charge extra $1.50 for the sour cream in the chilaquiles? Really? last visit for me","Good prices! Authentic mexican food! We really like the salsa that we ordered some to go. The portions are also the right size.","LOVE this place. Consistently good food, excellent service. \n\nWe go here several times a month at least and have not been disappointed. \n\nTheir salsa is good, not too spicy but not bland either. \n\nFavorite menu items include:\n\nChimichanga\n\nTamales\n\nChile Rellano Burrito\n\nVeggie Burrito\n\nAny of the above smother in the their green sauce.\n\nCarne asada tacos are delicious as well. \n\nDefinitely a bit of a hole in the wall but if you like Mexican food you will not be disappointed. The prices are extremely reasonable as well.","My Menudo favorite!  Sometimes get my order wrong but I pick up food once a week. Good choice for the closest thing to home made mexican fast food.  Pretty good service too","Went to this place on impulse after the dog park.  We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised.  We got our food to go and didn't have to wait long.  We got the enchiladas and a wet asada burrito.  Our food was delicious and correct so we will definitely be going back. Best Mexican food I've had in Vegas and not as Americanized like other spots.","Not a big fan of Mexican food- BUT my co-workers suggested that we eat at Tonys. Ordered the Carne asada plate! FANTASTIC! Service was great! Staff was pleasant. Restaurant was clean- service fast!  My friends had the taquitos and wet burrito.. also very tasty! Definitely recommend! Prices very reasonable too!!","The food here at Tony's is really good and the staff are always nice. The wait to get food takes awhile which is kind of surprising since Tony's isn't ever terribly busy. I've been going to Tony's for years and the food is consistently delicious.","I really liked this place. Before my visit, I was planning for this to be a replacement of the neighborhood Roberto's, but this place is definitely a step up. \n\nThis is what we had;\nChips and Salsa: I wasn't expecting them to serve complimentary chips and salsa, but they did. I think this is a very nice touch, which really distinguishes this place from Roberto's. The chips were made in house, and the salsa got spicy after you stopped eating. Make sure to have your drink topped off before you dive in.\n\nCombination (with beans and cheese) shredded beef chimichanga covered in hot sauce and cheese ($11): I like shredded beef over carne asada on my chimichangas because the beef is typically more tender which makes the burrito easier to eat. I loved how soft and melt-in-your mouth the beef in this burrito was. It also had beans in there, which I wasn't expecting but wasn't complaining about. The ONLY issues I had were that the size was pretty small, and the fried tortilla covering wasn't as crispy as other I've had. \n*The beans and rice were really awesome. The rice was light and fluffy, and the beans had really good flavor, but could have used a little topping of cheese.\n\nCarne Asada Quesadilla ($6): Larger than we expected, and there was no issue finding carne asada- it was STUFFED with meat. Jason said it was good.\n\nCarne Asada Tacos ($1.29 each): Jason was also impressed with these. He was expecting the tacos to come topped with the onion and cilantro it was pictured in the menu with, but it came out plain. The server was happy to bring out the toppings he requested though. \n\nI hate that I've been comparing this to Roberto's during the entire review, but it's the quality of food & service I was expecting. This was obviously not the case for several reasons:\n1. Service was good, and everyone spoke English. The last 2 times we went to R's Jason got a regular burrito (with guacamole, which he hates) instead of the breakfast burrito he ordered. Needless to say, I thought my chimichanga days were numbered.\n2. This is a place you'd actually want to sit down and eat.\n3. Servers were around to top off drinks, and get you everything you need to enjoy your meal.\n4. Chips are served when you dine in.\n5. Quality of food was definitely a step up. \n\nTRY IT!","Very good mexican food and a lot better than Robertos Taco shops.\nHugh difference","Once again I'm writing as I eat..\n  Chips and salsa while waiting for my order, I added a side of guacamole and sour cream..Cops are good but the salsa, sour cream and guacamole are watery but decently flavored.\n  Hard shell shredded beef taco- needed work..the shell is bad and the meat was not shredded nearly enough\n  Wet Chili Colorado burrito is a treat...very good\n  Rice is very good\n  Beans are good\n  Service is good\n\nAll in all, I like it and I well be back","Affordable and authentic--it's an A in my book! Recently moved here and I have only tried don Roberto's (yuck). Thankfully I tried this joint cause I'm sure gonna come back. Ordered to go my usual which I devoured cause it was tasty and juicy but I wish they would have given me some salsa and chips while I waited aprox. 15 min for my order..guess I've been spoiled with my other to go Mexican joints in Cali. Thus the -1 star!","Trying something new and couldn't believe how good the food and service is. Family oriented business and recommend this place to everyone. Definitely a must try.","Service is always great and I've never had a bad meal. If I'm there for breakfast I get the red chilaquiles and they're the best I've had in Vegas. Their salsa and horchata are really good too.","Worst customer service ever!! There's only 3 employees, it took almost 10 minutes to get our drinks and and another 10 minutes for the girl to come back to take our order. I'll never give this place my business.","First time there and from most yelp reviews figured give it a chance. \n\nService was meh. They sat us down and brought small basket chips for 3 people. The salsa was very good chunky tomatoes onion cilantro.  Ordered wet style burritos. Ordered carne asada unfortunately it was 70% beans and rice, maybe 20% steak rest salsa onions.  The enchilada sauce comes red basic, green basic & red spicy all very watery. Asked extra chips they replied $1.25 each basket.  I was like really? Oh ok I replied.  Only to bring another basket with salsa cup in half of the basket! Really?  Your burritos are tiny and $2.29 for a soda? \nSorry but you girls were ok servers, had to ask for refills of soda,  but extra for chips and meh food was hard to see $33 for crap had hard time adding $7 for the tip. I felt violated @$36 for 2 wet burritos 1 chicken enchilada combo 3 sodas.  \nDel taco about the same for half price.","The only reason why they get 2 stars from me is because the food was actually good... Prices was ok.. Didn't receive the chips and salsa that I've read about on here.. Wasn't approached by the cashier so we can order our take out for about 20 mins, even though she seen us standing there and smiled!! \n\nOnce we finally ordered it took 45 minutes to get the food!! I had time to walk to food 4 less, get a few groceries, put those in the car, walk back to Tonys and I was still waiting!!! Once I got the food I went home and boy was I disappointed!!!! There was barely any food on my plate!!!! So.. I waited all that time for this small ass plate! I love mexican food and this by far is the smallest shit I ever seen!!! Once I ate it I was STILL hungry!!! I ended up eating cereal afterwards!!! \n\nTo sum it up-- bad customer service, long wait (even though no one was in there), very small portion, no free chips and salsa.. Like I said the only thing saving this place in my eyes is that the food is actually good..","The best Mexican food I've had since moving to Vegas 8 years ago. The prices are very reasonable. The food takes longer because it is made as you order instead of just being re-heated and scooped on to a plate like a lot of greasy taco shops. This is an instant favorite because this place cooks real Mexican food the right way and isn't afraid to serve spicy salsa.","I used to come here often and was craving Mexican food and made a trip here instead of Robertos(what a mistake that was).  I got the chile relleno. It was the most disgusting relleno I've ever laid eyes on. It looked like it was made that morning or the day before and then popped in a microwave for 5 minutes. It felt like rubber, and the bottom of it was completely saturated in grease. I can't even put into words how disgusting this meal was. I called the waitress over and showed her, she apologized and acknowledged that it was gross and took it. A different waitress comes back with my food.. Long story short she said it was right and how it's supposed to be and that I'm wrong. And admitted they use a microwave. I don't know what happened to them but that was the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Can't figure out which was worse... the customer service or the overpriced crap microwaved food. Those girls you have in the front are ruining your business.","Here for the first time with co workers. Everyone loved what they ordered including taco and burrito lunch specials at 6.99.  The beans and rice were surprisingly good.  There were clear plates all around. Service was a little slow to start but after drinks came out, orders were taken quickly and brought out quickly.  The server was very polite. It was busy around lunch time like 12ish.  We're definitely going back.  Small note: $.50 service charge for card transactions under $10.","I enjoy going to tonys the food and service are great. You can't beat the prices and they serve beer :)","Place has really good Mexican food. I was skeptical because of the name, I know very shallow, but once my wife made me go I have been a fan. I stop in here every few weeks. I could eat Mexican food every day if I wanted to weigh 300 pounds so I limit it to twice a week and Tonys gets my Business twice a month.","Love this place. Came in once just to check it out and now we are hooked. We are here at least once a month. My favorite dish is the chimichanga.","They have really good food but their portions are small for a 10 dollar plate and waitresses don't check on tables unless is to pick up their hardly earned tips, they have good flan!","Great service!   Best chips and salsa combo, salsa is perfect not to spicy..  I really like their carne asada wet burrito so GOOD!   The chimichanga is the best I've ever had!","Great Food Great Service Always! There always there to see if your ok & they make feel at Home.....","I love this place! The beef tongue tacos and carne asada tacos are sooo good!! And so cheap!!","I had to come back the second time which was the next day. Nice and cheap and tasty too. If there's a crowd try it. This place is good. If you don't like it, My feelings wont be hurt.","I love me some Tacos...  And as such, I'm always in search for real, authentic flavorful tacos...  I was waiting for my pets to come out of the vets office and decided to do a quick Yelp search for tacos nearby; this is how I found this place.\n\nThe place had one customer, not that unusual since it was like 3 PM when I stopped by, but said customer seemed to be enjoying his food.\n\nThe cashier/waitress was very nice and took my order promptly.  Not knowing how the food was, I decided to do a \"sampler\" plate, with Carne Asada, Pastor, Buche, Carnitas and Deshebrada, one taco each.\n\nWhen the plate arrived, the tacos were made with the small tortillas, but they were filled up very nicely...  I enjoyed all of the tacos while drinking an orange Jarritos soda.\n\nThe food was so good that I had to order more tacos to go.\n\nI can definitely recommend this place to anyone and you won't regret it...","We were not impressed. Growing up in Cali did spoil us on good Mexican food. Tony's was just ok.","I order a torta of carnitas and it was not what I expected. The tacos are good.","Best Lengua I have had since leaving Los Angeles.  Alway have great service.","I was visiting in LV and saw the 5 star ratings here, so had to try it as it was close by.  It was very clean and a friendly staff.  I can't give it 5 stars tho'.... the food was pretty good, the salsa was great, and I will probably go back whenever I get back to LV.  I'd recommend it if you're in the area, but wouldn't make a trip across LV for it.","First time here food good service good the pork was awesome found a hidden gem must try","I eat here at leasts once or twice a week.  I love the cheap soft tacos and the shrimp and octopus cocktail.  The chips are good and the salsa is spicy and delicious.  The staff is always polite and the service is great.

{"reviews":["Well not sure I would give it a 5 star review. Its a Filibertos --- nothing really wrong - nothing really outstanding  except I like the carrots and cucs.","Extremely salty carne asada tacos! The meat was inedible it was so salty and I'm a fan of salty foods so that's telling you something. The horchata was bland and watery. Tables were dirty but that wasn't so much of a big deal I guess. Oh not to mention over priced! I spent $22 on a crappy burrito and 3 tacos. Come on! Would not recommend! I don't understand why this chain is so popular. It's NOT worth it.","I'd like to give a couple stars for the quality of the food but it's hard to judge the quality when they can't get your meal right....\n\nThis location is super busy & it looks relatively clean, that's about as far as I want to dig into it..... You ever get that feeling like your not wanted- well thats the impression I got from the lady at the counter. Felt like I was bothering her with my presence. Ordered a beef chimichanga and she confirmed my chicken chimi order so I had to specify beef. Ordered a couple rolled taco meals & sum hard tacos-all with rice & beans. With every item she asked \"is that it\" NO, we would like to continue ordering if possible..... read back the order and somehow we had a chicken chimi at the top of the list. had to revise that for a 3rd time. We specified rice & beans with all the meals. \"OK, in come with it\" A couple minutes later we received our order and good thing we did a quality check. Only the Chimi had rice & beans..... So of course we went back up to the counter and the lady then said-\"you want a side of rice & beans? That will cost you.....\" REALLY??? We asked for rice & beans with every meal. Promised we would get rice & beans, got our order NO RICE & BEANS! Now we have to pay for it. \n\nI like a Filiberto meal every once in a while but this place JUST PLAIN SUCKS! You know what else, I showed the lady my phone with my whopping $.50 YELP discount and of course she blew me off and didn't apply it. Why offer a cheesy .50 discount if your not going to honor it. It's only .50 but the snowball effect of their epic customer service entitles me to cry a little about everything.","Absolutely the best filiberto's around. Super clean, friendly staff, and amazing super rolled tacos!!!","Well as usual the rolled tacos lacked the quality of my first visit.  They were mushy in the middle and some parts of the tacos appeared maybe to not even been dipped into the fryer. The guacamole quality also not impressive this time and the cheese on the rolled tacos was not melted at all. Very concerned about prices for this item too as in most places you can get 5 of these for under 5 bucks always,  but they are 6.50 here with tax. Not worth it based on quality and not even a healthy dose of alcohol helped either.","We have been to this filibertos many times in the past with good service and great food however today ( which by the way will be our last time ) the food was really bad, we ordered supreme nachos, shredded beef taco and a I think a chicken taco ( I ordered a grilled chicken taco which the lady at the registered repeated back when she took our order ) all I can say is what a disappointment .......","I have always considered this a cheesy restaurant (no pun intended) but after eating at their dine-in on Indian Bend road, I was pleasantly surprised!  Great extras and great food!  Open 24 hours a day is pretty cool.  \nOn a side note I think the mall owners are going overboard on inexpensive Mexican dines... Taco Bell, Filbertos, and now Chipolte and on the same corner.  Poor planning and a little unfair to the restaurants!","Food salty and no flavor excepted grease","Can't believe I've lived in the Valley almost 10 years before my 1st visit to Filiberto's.  I've tried several things on the menu, but this is the bottom line - the places are SPOTLESS.  The food is cheap and real and good.  I'm partial to a tostada when I'm in a hurry.  I'll get an enchilada plate if I'm in the mood to sit down.  Both fill me up.  The salsa bar is always a nice touch, although I don't think their salsa is the best.  Quality fast food and a good price.","If I could choose less than one star I would. Filberto's is worse than methinks not!! Let me describe it another way - the food here is crap!! The prices are expensive and whom ever considers this Mexican food they deserve to get ripped off.\n\nThe beans on my plate were like a lump of paste. Wait paste has more flavor and texture. The Taquitos sucked because they were flavorless. The rice tasted like the cardboard box they came from. Very rarely do I throw food away. Normally I would take it with me to eat later but not this stuff. Should I go on - hell no, just don't go here. Go across the street to Taco Bell which really is not real Mexican either but at least it is edible!!","Very fast drive thru. My bacon burrito was a little on the soft bacon side for me. Ask for cruncy and it would have been a ten. I added pico to it great flavor combo as good as at home. Tortillas were fresh always a plus.","Not really that great. Large portions though.","This place isn't the greatest Mexican restaurant in the world, but it isn't the worst either. I  like Mexican food, but I don't care for the slow service and half warm food I got. I've been in a few times, which is why I give it three stars. The service could use some improvement. I don't think a smile would kill them. \n\nAnd since it's not all organic, I think the prices could be a bit cheaper. It's a hit or miss with this place.  Some days it's great. Other days, you wish you would have just let your 3 year old loose in the kitchen with last years leftovers.\n\nBest I can say it try it for yourself. You'll either love it or hate it. Or like me, you'll deal with it when your in town.","Located just off the 101, I drop in here for lunch and breakfast quite often.

I usually go just before or after that time period.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%","Good food for a fast food joint.  The staff is usually very cool (I'll admit to having a bit of a crush on one of them), the prices aren't the cheapest out there but the quality is generally good, and the daily $1 deal usually rocks.  \n\nAdd to that the free salsa bar with assorted goodies....I've rarely been let down.","I am impressed with this Filiberto's.  And, I believe Heather C has it right -- \"Mexican food the way my god intended it to be....huge portions and dirt cheap!\"\n\nSorry, normally I don't begin a review by quoting another Yelp'er and in this case a friend as well.  Up until a years ago, we had never been to a Filiberto's before and found the food genuine and good.  \n\nAnother positive working in it's favor, is that Filberto's runs variety of specials during the week (see photo).  Like Taco Tuesday and Bean Burritos Thursdays.  \n\nI view Filiberto's as a restaurant that someone from Mexico would start, after eating at a Taco Bell.  Heck, I even thought about doing it.  LOL  Which I imagine, was the original story behind it; and lo and behold: \n\n\"In 1986, Flavio, Aurelio, Francisco and Filiberto Tenorio had a vision of opening an authentic fresh Mexican food restaurant. They successfully opened their first one in San Diego, California, and they named it Filiberto's  In 1993 Filiberto's opened its first best Mexican fast food restaurant in Mesa, AZ.\" http://www.filibertos.com/ajax/kitchen.html\n\nRecently we were shopping at nearby Lamps Plus and Home Depot and decided to have dinner.  Funny thing, one of us wanted a burgers, while another wanted a burrito. So I took mine to go and met at McDonald's across the parking lot.  Funny but true.  Several of the employees nodded their approval.\n\nSo, a Three and a solid Half Star \"A-OK\" rating, just short of Four Stars.  I'll see you in the parking lot.","Best fast Mexican food in Scottsdale.  We get food to go once a week and the portions are big.  The prices and quality are also good.....Long live Filiberto's!!!!!!","Buyer beware they have raised the prices here again!!!!!","Make sure you order the day before so get your food in time. If you come at night, expect to wait 30-45 minutes.","Sadly, all good things must come to an end.  Much like my relationship with Los Betos, so goes mine with Filiberto.  Maybe his cousin will be better.\n\nOn my last visit, the chips were burnt. The guac tasted old.  The cheese in the enchilada had re-solidified to some disastrous inedible wad of nastiness.  Yes, I threw out cheese.  And the beans were just...there aren't words to express the horror.  Dry, stiff, terrible flavor.  Thankfully the taco was good, as was the rice.  It's a damn good thing I buy a lot of food!\n\nFor now, I say goodbye.  But I know in my heart, someday I'll be back, remembering the good times, hoping he will have changed...Until then, I leave an extra star for the memories.","Food poisoned. Trip the hospital. Needless to say I'll never be eating here again.","Update!!! You guys don't server cold burritos anymore!!!!! Thanks ! Good food here! They have a good .99 menu everyday!!!","I love this place!  Authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The cleanest Filiberto's I have seen.  I visit at least once a week during the lunch hour.  The Chile Rellenos are awesome, lightly battered, lots of spicy sauce... just simply delicious.  Taco Tuesdays (99 cent tacos) are a great bargain.  Complimentary salsa bar with multiple hot sauce type salsas, sliced cucumbers, and a fantastic spicy carrot/onion/jalapeno/chile salad... all free.  My only complaint is the salsa bar, soda fountains and cashier area, which are all located up front, can get very congested... I wish they could rearrange that somehow.  Oh, plus it would be nice to offer a chunky (pico de gallo) type salsa on the salsa bar, similar to Baja Fresh.  Check out the website for coupons - great deals!  You also will receive a bright orange (can't miss it) set of coupons with each purchase, to use on your next visit.  I'm a fan!","Wow! This is a tough one...\n\nThis place smelled like shit.   No other way around it. Came in and all the tables where up and things were being cleaned. I wondered if maybe someone had an accident.\n\nStill wanted a Arizona (California) Burrito so I hooked it up. There 2 red salsas are both kind of watery and to make it worse there was a fly constantly buzzin around my head. Still though.. I felt there should be. It was a great burrito. It was huge also. \n\nThis place is kind of like the Mexicanization of a Americanization of a Taco Burrito place.  And I am happy with that..  The kind of place if I lived in the area I would probably come back to every week.\n\nAnd they have Tamarindo Jarritos.. which i love!","Place smells like butthole but they make a damn delicious shrimp burrito. If you choose to eat at this sketchy joint make sure you get that order to go.","I am a fan of all these Aliberto's, Filiberto's, Antonio-Berto's, Stephanopolis-Berto's places. Most all are filthy, in lousy locations & neighborhoods, but the food is usually pretty damn good and inexpensive. Also, I think they are all 24 hours as well. Not only is this location 24 hours, but it's also clean, & in an area where I don't feel like I will be shot at, and the food is really good and very reasonably priced! So glad the concept has moved into the mainstream, and would love to see more Scottsdale locations (hint, hint... Like in my neighborhood up in N. Scottsdale... Mr. 'Berto)!","So far so good Taco Tuesday's are awesome cant beat that i would definitely eat here again","This is a great place for quick Mexican.  I don't even THINK about Taco Bell anymore.  I get the same thing all the time and am never disappointed.  I am THRILLED there is finally one in Scottsdale minutes away from work!","Not bad, not bad...could be better. For some reason they are a lot more expensive then I remember. I love mexican food! Even taco bell but if I have a choice I will still drive down to Los Betos on Hayden and Thomas.","This place needs way better reviews because I fell in love with the tacos here!\n\nI got the carne asada and the adobada taco - both were good and had gigantic portions of meat, guacamole and other toppings but the flavor of the carne asada was absolutely amazing!\n\nIf I lived in Scottsdale, I'd easily become a regular here!","I was afraid of Filiberto's for a lot of years.  They had only a handful of free-standing (that I knew about) 24-hour walk-up type places, and the stories I heard of people coming out of there indicated a gastrointestinal revenge of some type.  No bueno!\n\nHowever -- since they've opened up the Pavilions store, my heart has opened up to Filibertos!  Their portions are HUGE, their food doesn't taste plasticized or like it was just previously in a freeze-dried state.  I love their bean burritos with sour cream added.  Dreamy!\n\nThe staff are a little tough to navigate.  They sound very irritated a lot of the time, and I'm not sure if they're a little sick of inhaling the fumes of nearby McDonald's or what.  Inconsequential.  Mmm Filibertos!","So lets just be clear here, I love Hole in the wall joints. Particularly Mexican hole in the wall joints. While I wouldn't actually categorize this place as hole in the wall, I noticed some of the reviews seemed concerned about that. I wouldn't be. This is like going to El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell. During my stay in Scottsdale I went twice. Once for breakfast, and once for Lunch. \n\nBreakfast was absolutely delicious, with one small exception. I had a Bacon burrito with rice added (I highly recommend adding rice to breakfast burritos! its good). It was well wrapped, not too messy, plenty huge, and easy to eat in the car. The one complaint I had was the cheese. It was this bright neon orange gelatinous stuff. It just tasted oily and not very good. \n\nI also had the Super Nachos or Nachos supreme or whatever its called. Same problem, the cheese was just too greasy and oily. It didn't have much flavor. On the plus side, they pile on the sour cream, guacamole, and meat. It would have been nice to have some beans on the nachos too though.\n\nI would go back for a Breakfast burrito (sans the cheese), but thats about it.","Got my standard meal and was surprised how decent it was at this chain. The five rolled tacos meal with double rice was $6.99. The tacos were very thin and crispy and had enough guac to last the entire meal. Even saw real chunks of avocado in the guacamole. The rice was cooked perfect and free carrots and onions were included on request. I also splurged and got the $3.99 cheese quesadllia which again was excellent as far as those things go. They also now give you coupons for your next visit, which is a new twist for these kinds of joints. Good meal after five beers, but might even be good anytime.","As others have said, this place is meh at best. I love me some filly b's, however, this place is :\n\n1. Slow - 10-15 minutes in the drive thru line is common\n2. Expensive - Carne Asada burro for $7+ now. I can go down the street to another filly b's and get one for $5.","It seems like I'm always ordering the breakfast burritos when I come here. I wish I would change it up sometimes but they're so hard to pass up when I'm craving Filly B's!","Yuck. I went around 2:30 am to the 24 hour pickup. The food was greasy, doughy, and tasteless. It might be the worst Mexican food I have ever had.","For fast food, this place rocks! It's open 24 hours, has amazingly huge fresh portions, and always has a good-size handful of customers that seem happy with their food :) I love the chicken taco salad, although I wish the shell was corn instead of flour. The beef rolled tacos with guac are tasty and the fresh salsa bar that includes gardineria and fresh cukes is a plus! yummers!","Not the cheapest, not the best, but it was open late on a Sunday.\n\nthe Nachos were good, from what I remember...\n\nThe drive though took FOREVER. I guess that might be a good sign at a Mexican food place though, if you know what i mean. \n\nif it was the only place again ( I cant believe Taco Bell was closed!) I would give it another go.","25 minutes in drive thru. Ordered beef tacos. They tried to hand me chicken at the window. Gave it back after honking the horn and waving arms like a maniac. 3 people back out behind me. 20 minutes later got the order. Wouldn't have waited if I already hadn't paid.\n\nWTF FILIBERTOS?","Thrilled that this place is now at Pavilions.  It is not only convenient, but extremely cheap and quick.  The food is fresh, and the portions are huge.  I was always scared of this type of place but am now a fan.  My only complaint is the drive thru is slow, but the service inside is fine.  Have actually found myself eating here weekly...","Poor customer service everytime. The first time I went through the drive through they gave my order to someone else (after waiting 15 minutes in the drive through) which created two unhappy customers, then wanted me to wait for an additional 10 minutes while they made the correct order. The second time my order was ready and the girl at the window was too busy talking to co-workers to notice. Good food, but go to another location.","Mexican food the way my god intended it to be....huge portions and dirt cheap.  The fact that it's good is just a bonus.","Went through drive ordered carne asada burrito rice and beans... line went fast and food excellent ... I love their Spanish rice... im glad I found this location!"],"business_id":"suivIX2e8mQKGvbMvbcm2Q","name":"Filiberto's","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Depends what you are in the mood for, but for $3-5 for a good sized carne asada or breakfast burrito, it's hard to beat. This is by no means 'traditional' Mexican food though. It is good. It is 24hr. It's not going to win any authentic or best of XYZ awards, but if your looking for a burrito fix, hangover remedy, or just something cheap - this is your place.","This is where to go when all you want is cheap, fast Mexican food from a drive-though window.  It's open 24 hours.  Prices and portions are great.  Don't expect the \"best\" Mexican food.  It's just OKAY here, but it will hit the spot if you have a craving and don't want to spend a lot or get out of your car.  Would not recommend going inside unless you have the time.  I tried going in twice, and they were pretty slow to get food out.  I think they do most business through the drive-thru and really focus more on getting those orders out.\n\nGo on Taco Mondays and Tuesdays when they have 99 cent tacos.  I also like getting the Torta combo (I like it with carnitas) that comes with fries and a drink for under $6.\n\nBottom line:  Is it great?  No.  Decent cheap eats?  Yes.","Great prices, nice salsa/condiment bar inside, great daily specials like 99 cent taco Monday and Tuesday, as well as $1.99 burritos those same days. Drive thru consistently slow, go inside if more than 3 cars.","Love these chain restaurants.","I don't think I've ever been here during daylight. Or even before 10pm. I'm thankful they are open 24 hours, as very few places close to home are (I think McDonald's is - on weekends). Greasy, completely bad for you, huge portion, cheap, but always tasty Mexican food. Decent end to curb any late night cravings on the way home from a night out!","This is the place you want to go after a night of drinking. The food is typical, delishious fast Mexican food. The food is always hot and the drive thru is quick and efficient and the green salsa is amazing. We also love the breakfast burritos.","I love this joint. Thank goodness it's so close to my house! I go here anytime I need a little mexican food fix. Good burro's, good tacos, good nachos. Infact, it's really all good food. I think monday and tuesday are $.99 tacos or burros. MMMmmm.","This food sucks.","Bomb Mexican food. \nYou know it's authentic when your food is all greasy , and slopped together on a plate in a disorderly fashion. \nSub the ham for bacon in the breakfast burrito and add potatoes. You will not be sorry.","I have been here many times and they never disappoint.  On Monday's and Tuesday's  the burritos are $2.50 and tacos are $1.25.  The Horchata tastes a little bit watery or they would have got a 5 star.","Federico's is my go to fast food Mexican place! I always get a bean&cheese with potatoes, rice, and sour cream (easy beans), get it next time, it's seriously delicious! They dining room is always extremely clean and well kept, and the bathroom as well! One of the wonderful women that works there remembers me and knows my sauce and burrito preferences by heart! It gets packed during dinner time, but trust me, fresh Mexican food is worth a few minutes wait. OH AND DID I MENTION THEYRE OPEN 24/7?! Sooo convenient. :)","Sooooo excited that I moved near this place. The food is so good for drive-thru Mexican & the staff is really nice, too. \nThe breakfast burritos are delicious, the dinner options are so tasty, and their 'street tacos' are the bomb. Me gusta!","Was looking for another breakfast burrito option that was close to the house and stumbled on this place via Yelp.\nOrdered the Chorizo Special and Green Chili Burrito.\nChorizo Special was OK. Would have been better if I liked my papas cooked like the culinary world says they should be cooked. I don't. I like soft papas. I couldn't really tell if the chorizo was spicy or not. Will get a regular chorizo burrito next time. \nThe Green Chili Burrito was excellent! Lots of filling and it was good.","Had a breakfast burrito from here the other day and it was delicious! Not what I was expecting from \"fast food\" but glad I tried it. I will def go here again! Quick service and yummy food!","I like this place a lot. It's not a high-end Mexican place by a stretch, but they do a solid job at making really tasty meals for a really cheap price. It's amazing how fast the drive-through can be even when there are 15 cars lined up around the building.\n\nService is friendly and quick both inside and in the drive-through.","Ha the gringo version off a taco shop down in the southwest side. Everything is a little less greasy, spicy and probably a few cucarachas fewer. Food is decent and will have to do now this is the closest taco shop","Greasy ass breakfast burritos sucked and gave me some serious acid shits. You know the kind that feel like you are shooting fire out of your ass? I want to go back this place to try something different because I live close but every time I even drive near it to go to Safeway or the gym my butthole puckers up and my stomach starts to hurt. Sorry Federico's..you have won this round but eventually I will get drunk and come over at 2am and you can try to redeem yourselves.","Federico's is a nice new taco shop in an area that needs good Mexican food desperately.  It has 3 flat panel TV's wich is a bonus. The food is pretty good. Their beef nachos are really good,  the chicken nachos, not so much. The hard shell tacos are good also. They also have the bottled mexican sodas, I tried the lime soda and it was really good, I get one everytime I go now. Welcome to the hood Federico.","this place is great !! i love the food ,service is good & its in a great part of town.. breakfast burritos are excellent!!!","Great daily specials. Get coupons from their website (http://www.federicosmexicanfood.com/coupons.html). Monday and tuesdays tacos are 99¢. Sometimes it takes longer than expected for drive thru. But the food is good for sure.","Great drive through mexican food. Rivals Robertos in San Diego. Nuff said!","This is the place you want to go after a night of drinking. The food is typical Mexican food. The drive thru was quick and efficient. The major issue i had with this location is that the portion size on my Carne Asada fries was ridiculously small. Every other location i've been to usually gives you a good chunk of everything, but this location really got  stingy. That was a major disappointment. Ill revisit again in a couple of weeks and ill see if i have the same experience.","This joint just opened up by my house, so I thought that on $1.99 burrito tuesday i would give it a shot. What a mistake. I was pulling chunks of inedible food out of my mouth. It was those parts of the chicken, you know the ones, the connective cartilege, chunks of bone, grizzle, fat. I know that it was only $2.00 but really? Taco Bell delivers better food, and that is saying alot. \n\nTheir salsa is weak at best. I asked for hot salsa, it was not even close. The mild green tabasco sauce i buy has more flavour and heat. \n\nWhat a complete waste of money. I would never go back.","This place is what I would call the \"Speedy Gonzales\" Mexican food.  They remind me of that little Mexican mouse ~ extremely quick, small and ready to go.  \n\nThis is a convenient location if your near I17 and Happy Valley.  They are a fast food Mexican joint, but I enjoyed my meal.  \n\nLikes~ it is very cheapo-la to eat here.  I like how they have their restaurant set up with several flat screen TV's broadcasting sports and news (you don't get that at Caramba's nor Carolina's)...  I had their Carne Asada Torta meal.  It was very good and extremely cheap.  I've also had their Carnitas Torta and Burrito and their Pollo Asado Quesadilla, all were very good.  Did I mention they are cheap to eat!\n\nDislikes ~ NOT Eco-friendly using the dreaded styrofoam, offer only Pepsi products with a few Mexican sodas, no brewed ice tea, no beer and their salsa.\n\nFor a quick bite to eat, it's a good place to go for \"Speedy Gonzales\" Mexican food!","Do your beans have lard in them?  \"Uh, I don't know.\"  (5-10 seconds go by with us awkwardly staring at each other) and I realize I'm going to have to inquire further.  Response included rolling the eyes, a shoulder shrug, and angrily muttering something in Spanish to the folks in the back.  Consensus is they don't really think so.  But, do we really have to endure people like this?  In customer service retail, you don't just stare back at someone and tell them you don't know.  /sigh\n\nLocation is easy to find in the Safeway parking lot.  The drive through is right by the two gigantic trash bins in the eastern part of the parking lot (the trash bins indicate they are for tenant's use only).\n\nFood was similar to gringo-like Mexican chains such as Chevy's and On The Border, but prices were much better.  Rice and beans were plain, and beans portion was quite small with the combo (no more than 4-5 teaspoons).  Cheese Quesadilla was dry.  If you're dining in, get something to eat with your hands because the plastic silverware is among the most flexy and fragile I've seen.  They just don't hold up to a Chile Relleno.\n\nHot sauce served in ketchup squirt bottles.  It's also more of a \"medium sauce\" though.","Great burritos, fast service and clean looking place... I'll be back soon!","Great Mexican fast foods restaurant,  prices are fair and servings are great. Taco Bell,  Del Taco pale in comparison.  Has regular employees that are good to us regulars. As a family we eat there atleast once a week.  Great deals on tacos and burros on Monday s and Tuesdays. Student specials too","Honestly, I would normally never go to a place like this. Fast food and Mexican food together just doesn't seem like a good combo. I love Mexican food so I'm definitely picky when it comes to it. This place was just alright, the costs were surprisingly pricy for fast food, I've seen close to the same prices at an actual Mexican restaurant. The service was just okay, the lady wasn't super friendly but she wasn't rude either. The chicken wasn't my favorite, and the red and green sauce were just pure liquid, nothing special. It wasn't terrible but I probably won't come here again.","I wasn't expecting anything incredible from this place. But I feel like you'd have to make an effort to have bad Mexican food. It was pretty bad. Well, more like just fast food. I had a beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice & beans. Taco was pretty greasy and the cheese enchilada had completely unmelted cheese inside of it. Service was bad and they were mid-cleaning everything when we came in to eat. Which was 2pm on a Saturday. I don't want to see that! Yuck..","Much prefer Ramiros!  Two times they have messed up my order.  :-(  This time, I order a side of rice (from 'sides' on the menu) & got a micro-side...like 2 tblspn.  Seriously!  They just don't seem to pay attention.","I know these places get a bad rap all the time but this one here is delicious!\n\nMy hubby and I stopped by here after the ASU win on Saturday (GO ASU) and just picked up a few tacos. \n\nThey were delicious and hit the spot. I had a beef taco and he had two chicken tacos. Very filling for an after game snack and for around $7 you can't beat it!","Great for what it is. Had the 4 taco minor corn tortilla taco combo. Delicious. Love the condiments. Cucumbers. Radishes. In addition to the regular jalapeño carrot. Love it","blahhhh","Great Place for Taco Tuesdays!! $2 tacos and they are fantastic","Stopped in for a quick lunch and enjoyed a Carne asada burrito, just under $6.  Tasty and I noticed there was a fresh cilantro taste, much more so tht the standard f...berto's places.  Meat was a bit tougher than others but also there were fesh onions and spices too. I'd go again and they are amazingly fast at getting my order out","Hold on...wait a minute: Is that a 24 HOUR DRIVE THRU I see?! *Thinking* Oh yeah, definitely gonna try this place. I know, a Drive Thru BIG DEAL your thinking right? Well, in SF Drive Thru's are RARE. Very RARE. Unless your going to eat a Mc Donalds, Jack in the BOX..A Mexican Drive Thu SON OF A BEE STING! ok you get it. \n\nIt was late and I was in \"party mode\". I would not expect authentic Mexican food from this place. At this point I didn't care what the food tasted like, I wanted some. Did I mention they are open 24 hours a day! \n\nI ordered:\n\nA beef chimichanga plate and it was huge!! It was covered with cheese, sour cream and guac! It was fresh and tasty! Nice and Greasy.....yum! Rice and Beans. Not a fan of the rice..whatever though. The chimichanga was good! \n\n5 Chicken Rolled Taquitos (yes, my eyes are bigger than my belly)...They were nice and crunchy not soggy at all. \n\nThe Horchata was refreshing a simply delicioso! \n\nDefinitely a place I will go back to when in Arizona!","The super nachos and chicken tacos are awesome. Great orchata too, and more authentic then any other fancy Mexican restaurant.","I've been here a number of times and have had great service and very good food each time.  Don't mistake good for gourmet.  It's solid fast, mexican food. I usually grab the coupon from val-pak and save a couple of bucks. Nice salsa bar and very clean inside.  Very generous portions!","Thank you to Federico's on Happy Valley and 39th avenue for hosting a Desert Sage PTO fundraising night!

{"reviews":["sad part is Ive been putting off writing this review for awhile b/c I didnt want to think about it. \n\nBAR: I live really close to this casino maybe 7-10 minutes. the 1st time I came here the bar was kind of hidden behind the Roxy. But we really enjoyed it. Especially the gentleman bartender I want to say his name is Robert or Raul. Well since the renovation we came bk and sat at the bar which opens out to an awesome view of the mystic falls scenery and different colored christmas lights. \n\nMy last visit here was not too long ago, shortly after my bday inwhich my bf gave me a VERY EXPENSIVE NEW PURSE. We'd seen it while shopping almost a year ago and he remembered and went bk to get it. Sweet right? well I put my very new expensive purse in the empty chair nxt to me. . Ladies understand this. . \n\nthe guy kept grabbing my purse and the chair closer to him. so i pulled it back since this made me very VERY nervous. Then he yells at me saying how do you know someone's not sitting there? I said b/c there's nobody sitting there and no food there. so he slides a drink in front of it. after taking a huge sip? wth? really? I ignored him, an hr later and to make a long story short he gets the manager and she sides w/ him and instead of being mad at the fact that he grabbed my purse out of my hands and threw it across the bar - she gets a chair to put my purse nxt to the chair it was already in. \n\nLuckily the guy and his imaginary friend finished cussing me out and left. I will never go bk. The bartender the male and female were both nice to me but neithe rof them stuck for me to tell the manager that no, there was never anybody sitting there and this guy was being a jerk to a local patron. \n\nThe custoemr that sat there after him was so nice and bought my bf and I a round of drinks, so nice. he was visiting from CA and was great.  Sad how you can have both ends of the spectrum within minutes. I cant blame the bar/cantina for the behaviour of this guy but I can blame them for the handling of the situation. Looking back I should have just left when he started harrassing me but hindsight is 20/20. \nI will never go back to this casino again.","Last night (Feb. 11th, 2013) I went out to dinner with my folks.  We agreed on getting Mexican food.  But, we settled for Willy & Jose's.  As I have stated in a previous review, I allow myself one night per week to eat out.  So, my folks wanted to hitchhike on my night.  I like my folks so that was no problem... well small problem, they eat a lot earlier than I would like.  But, whatever...\n\nWe get to Sam's Town around 5 pm, park, and take a small escalator ride to Willy & Jose's.  As we walked up, I noticed that the outside seating was full.  Crazy!!!  Anyhow, we check in and were immediately seated, inside.  Our seats were near the Kitchen, so there was a lot of foot traffic around us.\n\nOur drink orders were taken immediately.  Our complimentary chips, salsa, and beans showed up on the table.  After eating a couple of chips I was done.  They were too stale for me.  So, I refrained.  As we looked at our menu, I had to help my Aunt figure out how to order Chicken and Rice.  That's all she likes when we go out.\n\n* Side note:  Over the past few years I tried to get my Aunt to try new things - new places.  But, no matter where we went, Mexican, Japanese, Thai etc... she found a way to just order Chicken and Rice.  I gave up and just accepted it.\n\nBack to my review...\n\nSo, our waiter, Ramero (sp?), was great.  He is the reason I give 3 stars.  He was friendly and witty, as well as efficient.  He made sure our drinks were always full and checked in on us from time to time, to make sure we were alright.\n\nWe order and within 15 minutes or so, our meals came out.  My aunt's chicken and rice was covered with cheese, green sauce and peppers.  She forgot to ask for her meal without all of the mess.  So, for the next couple of minutes, she scraped all of it off and put it on a smaller plate.  The chicken was too spicy for her but she survived.  My folks both ordered the Fajita special... which came out sizzling... so that's a plus.  They raved over it.  Maybe that should have been the move I needed to make.  But, I'm not a big fan of onions and peppers.  So, I would have felt foolish ordering it that way.  So, I decided to get the shredded beef burrito.  Again, it came out covered with cheese and green sauce.  All of our meals came with the same sides. - Beans w/ cheese, rice, lettuce w/ sour cream and tomatoes.  Bland is the word that describes the sides.  The burrito I had was so-so, but edible.\n\nWe were finished with dinner in about 15 - 20 minutes.  I am one that always wants to take part of my meal home, so I can eat it later.  I have always been like that... so don't judge!!!  \n\n*On another side note: It was nice that they had the bathrooms in the restaurant.  So, I didn't have to walk into the casino to find one.","A sagat award restaurant, and deserves it! Love this place, every time I am in town. I'll try and stop by, located in Sam's Town. It's worth it!!","The food was okay, not great.  The service was very good and the convenience was great given it was inside the casino/hotel we were staying at.","We just recently visit this place again! What can I say, I will continue to come by when we are in town. Every time here I'll try something different. It just gets better.","So much fun!  The servers were so friendly and nice...which is always great!  The food was good, with huge portions...not the greatest Mexican food, but pretty good.  They serve really fresh chips, with 2 types of salsa and beans.  They definitely won points with us that way...in addition to the bottomless margaritas!  If you spend $12, you get unlimited refills on the $5 margaritas...what an excellent deal.  If I wasn't so full of Mexican good food I would have had more than just 2 margartitas.  \n\nA little gem tucked in Sam's Town.","Wow- we had such a good time here! They really did make it feel like a separate restaurant, instead of a restaurant inside a casino. The service was amazing! Our server was funny, kind and responsive- he even helped us get salt on the rim of our beer glasses. The busser also did an outstanding job of constantly keeping our water glasses filled. \n\nMy Dad got the bottomless margarita- you have to order a $12 entree, which isn't too difficult, and buy a first $5 margarita, and then there are unlimited refills. The only downside to this meal was the margarita was not really that good. The  mix was very overly sweet- it just kind of tasted like melted slushy. The frozen was not strong at all, but the rocks was quite strong, but the mix was still cloying. \n\nMy dad's entree was the garlic, white wine and orange juice chicken- they gave him three full chicken breasts, and he loved it. My mom and I split a combination player with two ground beef tacos. They were very good. The beans were great and we also loved that they give you beans with your salsa, to dip your 1000 chips in, (they seriously give you a bag's worth of chips I think). \n\nMy parents said next time they come to vegas they'll come to Willy and Jose's even if they aren't staying at Sam's Town.","We checked out this place because we heard about their bottomless margaritas, and my wife was in the mood to get her margarita on.  We were very optimistic, but were ultimately disappointed in our visit.\n\nDrinks:  The margaritas were fine, but the refills on them were VERY slow to come.  This was a Sunday night, and not very busy, so I was disappointed at this.  \n\n\nFood:  We ordered a queso fundido for an appetizer. It was fine, but not as \"dip-py\" as I was expecting -- I was hoping for more of a cheese dip, not just melted cheese, which quickly congealed, and was hard to get on the chips after five minutes.  I ordered fajitas, and they were pretty tasty, standard, no complaints.  My wife ordered a chimichanga, one of her Mexican favorites, and was very disappointed to find it not at all crunchy/crispy, but more soggy.  Very disappointing.\n\nOverall Service: Aside from the margarita slow down, the rest of the service was also very slow -- timing of courses lagged, and for a slow night, the food came out very slow.  Most Mexican places we've been to are MUCH faster.  The water lady was VERY prompt, and came by many times, and that was great.  My wife drinks VERY fast, and we rarely had an empty water glass. It's too bad that lady wasn't in charge of refilling margaritas.\n\nWe would give the food 2.5 stars, and the service 2 stars.  The price isn't that great for a Mexican place off-strip in Vegas, and there are a lot more authentic places with reasonable prices and better service.","I had the red chili burrito and the beef is straight out of a can.  It wasn't bad but their food is not that good.  The salsa also was factory prepared, not fresh and probably came out of a gallon jug.  I watched our order sit under the heat lamp for over 10 minutes.  I complained when the waiter brought it and he offered to make a new one but then I would have eaten after everyone.  The hostess was so snippy we were turned off already and then things went downhill.  The place was almost empty so there was no reason for the delay.","We met friends for dinner tonight at Willy & Jose's.  Our server was a very friendly person with a fine sense of humor.  Two of us ordered a trio of proteins--shrimp, chicken, and beef.  My friend doesn't eat shrimp, so it was put in a bowl on the side with extra sauce and I had double shrimp.  Her husband had beef tacos, and my wife had a chicken dish--the name escapes me.\n\nWe all enjoyed our entrees.  Very tasty sauces, good portions without being huge, and just the right amount of seasonings.\n\nFor dessert, each couple shared an order of chocolate tacos.  The taco shell was a bit rubbery and was filled with vanilla ice cream.  We made the mistake of not picking it up and eating it like an ice cream sandwich when it was cold and still somewhat frozen.  We were given small spoons when we needed a knife to slice through the bottom of the taco.  Still, it was tasty if a bit challenging to eat.\n\nI'll return to Willy & Jose's.","ECK ECK ECK! This place is a shame to latin food. It's just a bigger version of a run down taco bell and honestly TB has these guys by the balls. I'm from a Latin family and taking my mother and grandmother here was EMBARRASSING! I give 1 star because i cant give 0 and I do admit I liked the outside dining option BUUUUT the food was disgusting and I believe any one who takes this food they serve as acceptable has never had true Latin food or even good food. They should be serving this mush out of a truck stop. No I would bot recommend this to my enemies.","I am surprised at the range of reviews of this place. It seems like everyone either loves it or hates it. Well, I am taking the middle of the road on Willy & Jose's. It is OK. Sometimes worse or better than others. They have moved locations inside Sam's Town, and neither of them are that impressive. The new location is cute and does have an outside patio which is in Sam's Town giant covered courtyard. This way you can sit outside even in the rain.\n\nThe food is pretty good. It is also very large. If you like large portions this is a good place to eat, but you can easily share if you want. The chips and salsa are pretty good and plentiful. It is possible to fill yourself up on the chips, so be careful. I have had many of the dishes here and they're pretty good. But, if you are expecting authentic Mexican, go elsewhere. The tacos, burritos and re-fried beans are good enough, but the Spanish Rice seems to always miss it. It looks the part, but never has any real spice to it.\n\nThe service is hit or miss. I have been there when the server is around whenever you need them and when you can never find one. Don't look for great service here. I think you will be disappointed. I have also never gotten a worth wild margarita at Willy & Jose's. I know they have a bottomless margarita, if you ever get asked if you want another, but seriously, why bother. They really aren't worth the price of one.\n\nThe last issue I have is the price of all items. The prices are a l bit high for just ok food. Bring up the quality to match the price.","Well my wife and decided to try Willy and Jose's again. We first ate there about 6 yrs ago. So we decided to try it again.\nThis second visit 6 tears later confirms it. What an awful place.\nThey served us the usual tortilla chips, salsa and bean dip.  The chips were old and hard. Bean dip .... Nothing to crow about. Salsa tasted canned.  The wife ordered a strawberry margarita. More strawberry syrup and not enough booze. $ 8.00 for a $ 2.00 drink.\nWife ordered chicken enchiladas with mole. She enjoyed it.\nI ordered a 3 item combo. Pork tamale tasted fine but it was covered with a poor canned tasting enchilada sauce; the chili relleno was filled with cheese reminiscent of Velveeta or Cheese Whiz..the relleno was a little bit over fried.. And the flauta was not crispy at all. Soft like a enchilada. \nService was okay but it could not makeup for the dismal food. \nI'm definitely not a fan. Won\"t go back. Roberto's greasy Mexican food is heads above the garbage served at Willy & Jose's.","My husband made reservations but since the place was empty they weren't needed.. The atmosphere was nice, sitting outside by the Mystic Falls and the wait staff was nice.\n We started with a margaritas. I had a regular one on the rocks and my husband a frozen strawberry..They were pretty weak. The chips and salsa were a disappointment . The chips were stale, the salsa bland and bean dip tasted canned. For an appetizer we had the potato skins. They were good but we had barely started on them when our food came.The food was warm but not hot like I would have expected.  I had the fish tacos and was expecting a fish fillet not chopped up breaded fish pieces that looked more like breaded clams. My husband ordered a taco, beef enchilada and a cheese enchilada but received 2 beef enchiladas (one ground one shredded) and a taco.. He said they were kind of bland.\nAs we were finishing our server brought the check. I had to ask if we could have flan. \nShe was a little embarrassed and the flan was the best thing of the meal.\nI don't blame the server for the food. The kitchen needs an overhaul of staff that would make sure the food comes out hot and at the right time.","Great location. They should do more with it. Food is standard Mexi-American, nothing notable, really. Asked for hot salsa, got something passably decent. Margarita was most, if not all, syrup. No tang or booze. Too sweet to even finish. Ordered a cheese crispy, expecting sizzling hot cheese and, well, crispy. Nope. Plenty of cheese, but soggy tortilla and the middle wasn't even melted. Service, ok, not great. If you've ordered, you'll never see the waiter again. Overall: meh.","Willy and Jose's only gets two stars and that is because the food was good.  The prices where to high for a Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas.  The service was terrible.  I ordered a Cadillac Margarita that is supposed to come with a float of Grand Marnier.  The Margarita showed up and it was over flowing because it was watered down.  I like mine on the rocks, so I am guessing it just sat at the bar while the waitress (we were one of two tables she had) did something else with her time.  I drank a few drinks out of it and my wife reminded me of the float.  So the margarita sat there getting more watered down while I waited for the waitress to come back to the area of her only two tables.  Finally she showed up and I reminded her of the float so she took it back to the bar.  I figured they would remake it.  Nope all the did was add a half shot of Grand Marnier and send it back.  It was 80% water by this time and terrible.  My wife had iced tea,  the waiter who had the section next to us kept his tables well watered and well taken care of on iced tea and soda.  Do you think that he could come to any other section other than his?  Nope not at all.  He by passed us every time.  I asked the busser for some more tea for my wife and she went to go and get the server.  It was terrible service, then I was charged for a soda and I only had water.  Then it was a huge production to get the $2.75 taken off that they charge for soda.  Like I said the only redeeming quality was that the food was cooked properly and tasted good.  There are to many good places to go for Mexican food in Las Vegas to waist my time with Willie and Jose's.","If you're already at Sam's Town and hankering for Mexican, this is the place to go.  \n\nWhile you're there, make sure to sit in Maverick's section. His service leaves you smiling and happy.","I've been here a few times over the years. I'd probably eat here more if I didn't live on the opposite side of town.\n\nI've always enjoyed my experience here and look forward to eating there again.","Shockingly good, better than it has to be. \n\nChicken fajitas was seasoned well, fresh veggies, etc. Tortillas fresh, flaky. My dad had a burrito, fresh, not oily.\n\nThis doesn't seem like \"authentic\" Mexican food to me... in LA, it's all over the place but \"authentic\" Mexican food sometimes is a sloppy/greasy mess where all the flavors run into each other.  Not here.  Everything is distinct.\n\nAlso, the service was great... totally attentive, a waiter and a 'helper' refilling drinks.  Sometimes, a third person would jump in.  My cup literally was never less than half full.\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise.","Have you ever had authentic Mexican food that makes you smile just thinking about it? Yeah-me too. Unfortunately, this pretender is the exact opposite of authentic! Shame on you Willy and Jose for serving this crap.\n\nHere is what I did like......\n\nThe available seating in the courtyard of Sam's Town is pretty cool- it felt like I was on vacation. Within minutes, chips and a mild salsa were brought to our table. I enjoyed the salsa, but didn't care much for the bean dip that came along with it. Ok-that's all the positive things I can say about this place.\n\nFor dinner, I selected the green burrito. The menu described it as chile verde (slow roasted pork) with beans inside of a large flour tortilla topped with melted cheese and green sauce. Here is the problem, the chile verde was lacking any flavor at all. Most versions of this dish have onions, peppers, and spices infused throughout. All I could taste here was meat, cheese, and a soggy tortilla. Perhaps the soaking wet lettuce and over ripe tomatoes that accompanied my dish had something to do with this watered down entree. I am so sick of Mexican restaurants trying to pass this off as some delicious salad. All this does is create a puddle in the middle of my plate and turn the cheese into a curdled mess. The rice and beans were atrocious. The rice tasted like that boxed crap from rice a roni, and the beans were boring and chalky.\n\nThe service at this restaurant was OK. Three different people brought things out, so I couldn't really tell who our server was. I did ask one of the employees if they made their own tortillas and her response was \" I don't know\". Hah? \n\nOur bill came out to a little more than $ 30.00 for two entrees and two sodas. Overpriced for mediocre food! I'd rather have my dog pass gas in my face than eat at this place again.....","It was such a nice day I wanted to find a patio to sit on and drink a margarita. I was a little fooled by a review that mentioned \"outdoor\" seating. I guess I still can't wrap my head around all the fake b.s. that makes up this weird town. Yeah, no outdoors to be had. So I walk in and head for the bar.\n\nMargaritas - boring and watered down. Nothing exciting and really I can't believe that a casino would make something so ridiculously weak. They were fairly cheap though so that was ok.\n\nChips and Salsa - Boring again. The bean dip and salsa had no flavor. The chips were kinda stale. I kept wishing there was flavor. None to be had.\n\nFajitas - Seriously, even Casa Bonita does a better job. God were they ho hum. I mean at least TRY to put a little flavor in there. \n\nService - The guy was nice enough but it seemed like he was tired and burned out. He was trying to be nice but you can tell he's been in Las Vegas too long.\n\nAtmosphere - It would have been ok but then some horrible music started up. Apparently, yet another cheesy, mouth breather \"light show.\" The blaring sound of \"Cotton Eyed Joe\" had me practically running out the door. \n\nNo, I won't be back. This is the first time I've been in Sam's Town and see NO REASON AT ALL to ever make it a second time. Place was just sad. I drove back home wondering if real Mexicans get irate at the insulting bastardization of their food. I KNOW this crap isn't what they eat. Save your money and go elsewhere. Anyone who has given this place a good review should stop reviewing anything because you CLEARLY have poor taste.","Willy & Jose's is average Mexican food, with great happy hour prices.  Their happy hour is 7 days a week between 4-6PM, and they have both food and drink specials.  They have $1.00 off all cocktails at the bar in addition to various daily specials where you can potentially get a cocktail and a meal for less than $10.\n\nThe food here is okay, but nothing special.  I ordered a 2 item combination (which was a happy hour special) with a chicken taco and a beef chimichanga.  I liked both, but I didn't like the rice that came with my plate.  It was terrible, and by far the worst thing about my meal.  I liked the beans, and also that they had served us complimentary beans with our chips prior to my entrée.\n\nAlthough Willy & Jose's is not the greatest, nor most authentic, Mexican food, their happy hour specials can't be beat.  I wouldn't mind dining here again for happy hour.  However, I think their regular prices are far too high for their quality.","The two stars are for our bus boy and the one attempt our server made to help us. \n\nFOOD- was horrible. The chips were ok. Salsa was ok, beans were bland.  I ordered a combo plate, a pork tamale, and a chille rellano. The pork tamale had next to no meat.. I scraped most of it out and it was one bite. The chile rellano was slimy and salty. The beans and rice were bland.  I didn't eat much of it. \n\nMy fiance ordered a shrimp burrito. It was not as described to us when we asked and it smelled. Like rotten fish. Not only that but it was full of \"scallops\". Which turned out to be bat ray wing, not even real scallops, those were chewy. He sent the whole thing back because of the smell and the tortilla was soggy/mushy it had the consistency of mashed potatoes.  15 bucks for THAT? C'mon now. \n\nOur friends had a burrito and combo plate, they were not impressed either. \n\nSERVICE- We had to wait 20 minutes for a table when over half the restaurant was empty. We ended up with a crappy table.  \n\n The bus boy should have been our waiter. He was pleasant and came back promptly and frequently to ask if we needed anything and to refill our drinks.  Our waitress wasn't awful, but she was short, and acted like we were a huge inconvenience the second she walked up.  She did however look worn out and made an attempt to be pleasant about the burrito we sent back. It took a while to have our order taken, which would have been fine had they been even slightly busy. \n\nI tried to get a group of employees attention to take the check, I held it up and they just looked at me and went back to talking. \n\nOur friends and I were leaving when my fiance was stopped by the manager and asked how everything was. He told her he felt it was over priced for the quality, and some issues with the food. Like his mushy, smelly, burrito,  and my tamale having no meat. She got snotty and said \"you're wrong , I watched them make the tamales\". She then said \"well if you had a problem you should have said something before\" ( um hello, genius, we sent food back and told our waitress!)  This is what angered us the most. Don't ask people what they thought and be rude if you don't like the answer! Very unprofessional. We still paid our full bill so it's not like we don't have a right to complain when asked.  Change the garbage you serve and you won't have as many problems!  \n\nWe won't be back, over priced,  bad food, and so-so service.","Reviews on W&Js are all over the place.   We stayed at Sams for 5 nights and ate here twice.  Happy both times.   The food was maybe just above average .   We had marguaritas over the rocks (the only way) and were good.   Probably just depends on who is bartending.    1st time, they were perfect.  Not overly sweet with plenty of taquila.   2nd time, they were pretty ordinary but still good.   We sat inside the 1st time and then sat out on the patio which is nice.   The waterfall show is fine but just not while we're trying to enjoy our dinner.   If you have room for dessert, their flan is exceptional.","What can I say? Great food, great little 'patio' that overlooks the waterfall and daily water show in the atrium at Sam's Town. If you go for dinner, that is the best time to watch the light show. What really blew me away was the $9.99 Bottomless Margaritas and Endless Tacos! Yea, I wrote that right...$9.99...and they are great Margaritas and Tacos. Get off the strip and experience an awesome place!","We get to Vegas about once every 3 years or so. We always go out to W&J for dinner. Went there on Monday night to watch the 49ers win. Sat at the bar, had all you can eat tacos, beer and margaritas. Reuben, he bartender was attentive and very friendly. Kept our drinks full while taking care of everyone else. Our tacos were very good, one of us had ground beef and one had chicken. The meat in the tacos was plentiful and flavorful. My margaritas were good and the beer was nice and cold. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. Was able to watch the laser and water show from the bar. Had a wonderful night and will go again next time we in Vegas.","Decent food, service was OK.  Let me rephrase that, the waitress that waited on us was nice and very attentive. We had a party of 8 for my dads 70th birthday party and I made reservations for 6, my party was late so the hostess informed me that they only hold the table for fifteen minutes... understandable but she was just rude about it. I also brought a birthday cake with me and the actually charge an additional $10 to bring your own, crazy!\n\nThe food was alright, I had the beef enchiladas and it was good, the rice and beans were kind if bland. \nMeal was $13\nGratuity for party of 8 %18\n\nThe part that makes the whole place worth while is the location, right beside the magical forest and there is balcony seating the is out on the patio. The ambiance is nice.","Celebrated Valentine's Day with my wife of 35 years last night. It was great! We sat in the patio area and watched the light show at Mystic Falls. Great atmosphere, very good food. My wife is gluten intolerant but was able to eat the chicken souiza with the rice without any problems. She had enough to bring home about 1/3 of the plate.\n\nI had the chicken chimichanga and was unable to finish it. Mostly left the rice and salad but ate every bit of the chicken and most of the wrap! Very good flavors\n\nFor desert she had the flan, again no gluten issues, and I had the Bananas Foster but didn't finish it because - it is a two person dish! Who knew? But the BF was so good!\n\nOur waiter, Roy, did an excellent job in caring for us. Good sense of humor and great service. All in all a great dinner experience!","Good food. My boyfriend and I both had chimichangas and the portions were huge! Both were good and it was nice to sit on the \"patio\" and listen and watch the show. Sams Town is becoming one of our favorite places!","Took my wife to this joint. Not impressed,  I ordered the most basic of mexican cuisine,  Chile Rellenos & Tamales and were disgusting, tasteless and offensive. Do not waste your money, Taco Bell would of been 100x's better","I've been coming to Sam's Town since the mid 90s, and each trip always included at least one visit to Willy and Jose's, and after I moved to Vegas a year ago, the visits stayed just as frequent. 15 years ago, the food, staff and service were amazing. However, ever since they moved into their current location (what used to be an Italian place originally), everything has gone downhill. I remember coming to visit year after year and having the same bartender, the same host and the same servers. Of course, all of them are long gone now - what a shame. \n\nThe last 3 times I have visited, the hostess has been extremely rude or non existent. Tonight, we stood there for 10 minutes and kept being told \"be right back\". Finally, someone comes and tells us that their wait list has disappeared. Before I could even ask how long the wait was, she ran off. In between all this, she slammed into us with a stack of menus and just said \"be right back\". Eventually they locate their very modern piece of paper with names scribbled on and without even saying a time, ask for my name and start to write it down. After they finish, they say about 30 minutes. Where was that 15 minutes ago when we started? Oh, that rude hostess? She was wearing a shirt that indicated she works at the buffet. Either they are short handed or she was \"too busy\" to change. I'll go with the latter, since I've seen her there before. \n\nOn the times where the rude staff weren't enough to conquer my hunger, the food is average at best. The value is decent, however avoid the bar. The drinks are extremely overpriced for the quality you get. Servers don't listen when you order. A perfect example is ordering a margarita without salt. Of course, he brings it with salt and like any reasonable customer would, I refused it. He walked back to the bar, took another glass and dumped the same margarita in another glass and brings it back to the table with a hefty amount of salt at the bottom. \n\nI do hope the powers that be, will look at this and assess their once famous Mexican restaurant.","A decent Mexican food restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas. This restaurant is located inside of Sam's Town. I like the food and service here. I would also be willing to say, that it's one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Vegas. Certainly, if you are visiting or staying at or near this property, you should give W & J's a shot. It's good for a dependably filling, tasty meal at a very reasonable off the Strip price.","It has been a while since I was last at Willy and Jose's and I think I remember the food being better.  It seems that their location change to where the old cafe used to be has affected it.  That is not to say that the food was bad.  The chips, salsa and bean dip were all pretty good.  I ordered two item combo with a chicken tamale and beef flauta.  The tamale, while tasting good, was small with little meat and a thin layer of masa.  The flauta was filled with delicious beef and was quite good.  It was odd to me that it came out covered in enchilada sauce.  I am used to getting a flauta dry with a scoop of sour cream and guacamole on the side.  The rice and beans on the plate were both OK though not my favorite version.  The rice was more spiced and more heavily seasoned than I like.  And I typically prefer black beans to refried most anywhere I go.  As for the rest of the parties meals, my grandma did not care for her chile relleno stating that is was \"different.\"  This is not in any way a mark against Willy and Jose's.  My grandma is just very particular in what she likes and if it is not what she gets at home it is not good.  My dad, on the other hand, said the relleno was good but perhaps on the spicy side for the more sensitive eater.  I would not know.  I don't eat rellenos.  I did, however, take home the left overs from my aunt's meals.  The chicken quesadilla was loaded and quite filling.  The steak boracho from my other aunt was tough and lacked significant seasoning though I could smell the whiskey it was marinated/cooked in.  I just simply could not taste it.  Finally, the margaritas ordered by my aunts were sent back for not having enough tequila.  They consider themselves margarita connoisseurs and should know a bad drink from a good.  The waitress seemed to agree that the bar tender had not used enough tequila and was happy to add a bit for them.  Over all, not a bad meal at Willy and Jose's but I've had better from the same place in the past.","Food was good, service was ok.  Nothing bad to write about, but nothing outstanding either.  Decently priced and tasty.","Dined here on 5/17...average at best...food ok, margaritas eh...service ok...ambience eh...there's two other similar restaurants that I can think of in Las Vegas that offer more authenticity, tastier cuisine and much better margaritas. Try Viva Zapatas on E. Craig Rd. if you're in North Las Vegas or Lindo Mihoacan on Flamingo Rd. in East Las Vegas. You'll get more bang for your $$.","Took my daughter to Willy & Jose's tonight for her birthday. We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly.  Our drink orders were taken, and complimentary chips and salsa delivered very quickly . We placed our orders and enjoyed the show.  Dinner arrived and the serving size was very large. I had the chicken chimichonga, very tasty. Chicken tasted like it had come fresh off the grill, so good! Served with refried beans and rice.  Our waitress checked on us several times, and our glasses were never empty. Being a local, we try out several restaurants a year.  We have been to Sam's Town several times but this was a first visit to Willy & Jose's. I will be back again. Service was wonderful, food excellent!  Price was budget friendly."],"business_id":"thlVek1kUo3fyxUEap65zw","name":"Willy & Jose's","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["My wife and myself been coming here for along time and I have to say I'm gonna give it only one star. Reason being is the bar area. If you sit in the bar be prepared to get ignored by your server and the helper. There were only three different tables with people and only around 8:30 pm  ( they close at 10 ) and the server couldn't even keep up with that!!  We ran out of chips early and boom.....nobody around!  How convenient.  Both server and helper. GONE.  must have been break time.  I always hate when \"you\" the guest has to ask for something ie: drinks, extra, ect...WTF??!! I did notice even the servers had to wait on this person to make drinks for other tables. I love this place but, better stick to sitting in the regular room..","I have been to this Macayo several times for lunch as it's pretty close to my office.\n\nThey have lunch specials that run around $8.\n\nThe chips and salsa are decent, and I've liked all of the entrees that I've tried. Their chicken tortilla soup is pretty decent too.","I went with a group of about 10 people for dinner on a Friday night. They had a table saved for us in the bar area which was perfect. It takes groups awhile to get there so the server was checking on us from time to time and getting drinks as people wandered in. They also brought lots of chips and salsa for us which were very tasty.\n\nMy dish was wonderful, (I ordered the baja enchiladas) and there was lots of rice and beans that came with it. i also ordered the side salad for $1.99 extra and it was really good. The rest of the table seemed to like everything they ordered.\n\nI will stop there again if i am in the neighborhood.","When we're in Vegas, we like to eat off of the strip some. My grandparents are very fond of this place so we come at least once a summer. This is your typical mediocre chain. The portions are large and it looks like a basic Mexican restaurant. It's not the best I've had but not the worst either. I think every region has one of these \"family\" chains that the older crowd love. I probably wouldn't come back unless I had to.","Out of Business.  Another one bites the dust.  Went there today at 1115am. for my moms birthday.   No sign but door was still locked, and outside trash cans overflowing.  Phone number isn't any good.\nA semi trailer, attempting to make a delivery and all four of our cars left..\nWe ended up at Lindo Michoacan on DI and Pecos.  \nWhich made me very happy.\n\nProbably a Godsend as I never liked this place but unfortunately my elderly mom did.","A real popular place among the UNLV students. I've been here many times but I'll focus on my visit last night.\n\nHostess staff was not very friendly at all. There were two standing up there doing something with the cash register and completely ignored me and my party. Waited two minutes until a 3rd hostess appeared out of nowhere and promptly seated us. The other two girls never even made eye contact.\n\nLike most Mexican restaurants you get complementary chips and salsa. They provide two types of salsa - a mix between mild and medium that is going to be way too hot for the strictly mild crowd, and a weak hot variety. \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive throughout the meal. The food here is always delicious, and made well - but it's nothing to rave about. It's your typical Mexican fare with plenty of options. The decor is warm and inviting. It appears that you're eating outside in a Mexican cafe, with adobes and faux porch lined balconies.\n\nIf you want good, authentic Mexican food ( and even some American choices such as chicken fingers,) you can't go wrong here.","I will never eat here again. Ordered to go. Food was frozen when we went to eat it less than 5 minutes later and it wasn't made correctly. Instead of trying to fix the problem, we were told it was our fault it was cold because they told us it would be ready in 15 minutes and we showed up in 20 minutes. Also we were told it was cold because I added sour cream and guac to the burrito. Any other restaurante I've been to that adds those sides seems to be able to serve the food warm. Customer service was awful and the food didn't ever taste semi-good. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.","Andy and I sat at the bar tonight and the experience was almost impossible to describe. When we approached the bar the \"bartender\" Maxine says \"it's dirty\" so we sat down while she cleaned the bar. No hello, no I'll be with you in a moment... Nothing. The busser grabbed us waters and the hostess grabbed us menus. We were considering ordering margaritas but then witnessed Maxine dumping a new batch of margarita mix into the old container.... The date was just a little over 2 weeks old on the container. That's when we should have left... We ordered a 3 item como. Two shredded beef tacos and a cheese enchilada. The tacos were sour... Not a great taste for beef. The enchilada was Luke warm. We barely ate half the meal and asked for the check. We were never asked how it was. Over all the bar was disgustingly dirty, the food was terrible and the service even worse. Were honestly worried about getting food poisoning. This was my favorite restraunt as a kid, this expierence makes me very sad and disappointed. I will never return.","The chips make you really full so you won't finish your food, unless your like gorilla hungry.  I went with my bosses because they LOVE it here. I got a combination plate with a chicken taco and a baja enchillada and it was soooo freakin good. I was muchin! From what I heard how good the food taste depends on what resturant you go to and they say this is the best and I can't argue!","SALSA!\n\nI grew up on Macayo's. My dad was a busboy there when he was a mere 15 years old in Old Vegas. I swear I wouldn't be as tall as I am today without the influence of the TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) and the bean and cheese burrito. I still haven't found an albondigas soup that even comes close to Macayo's. Plus there is nothing like their unlimited smooth salsa with tortilla chips that come at the beginning of every meal. Heck it's so good they sell the bottled salsa at your local grocery store. \n\nIn my adult age, I have learned to enjoy a new aspect of Macayo's: the MARGARITAS. My favorite thing now is to bring my Cha-Cha margarita glass to the bar and have it refilled for $3.99 a glass. Cha-Cha is a ceramic glass in the shape of a Mexican woman and her hat serves as the receptacle for the healthy margarita refills. She originally cost $10.99 with a margarita. \n\nThe service nowadays is a toss up. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not. They have a pretty good happy hour with discount beers and margaritas if you don't want to go the Cha-Cha route. You have to sit in the bar to take advantage of the half off appetizers. The Shredded Beef Burro Enchilada Style is beyond amazing. This may not be super authentico Mexican food but it knows the way to my heart.","Not very authentic Mexican food but very good. Baja sauce is unique and tasty!  They were very accommodating to my gluten free food needs","I'm not quite sure what all the fantastical chatty chat is all about. It's ok Mexican food, I've been there three times & have yet to have an orgasmic south of the border experience.  They do fork over the chips & salsa which is a plus, but the salsa is a lil on the ratty side in my personal opinion.\n\nMaybe being from California I'm spoiled with fabuloso pintos?  I most likely won't be going back, I'll just wait until I go to CA.","This place just plain smells....and not of things that make you want to enjoy your meal... eww just thinking about it makes me gag.","I don't know why so many people are ragging on this place. I've been coming here every time that I come to Vegas.\n\nYes, the decor inside is a little \"old\" and yes so are the waitresses, but don't knock that down before you get to the awesome menu.\n\nTo me, it's just a vendor serving up some good, local comfort food.\n\nTry coming for lunch as they have an affordable menu and plenty of tables available in the area.","Worst food I ever had!!! Would rather eat food outta the garbage than come eat at this culinary disaster of a restaurant","Food ok. Service stinks.","Had been to Macayo's in the Phoenix area countless time, but today on our Dive bar tour . . . we decided to stop in for lunch . . . One BIG Mistake.\n\nThe service was terrible . . . the server took our drink order . . . and THREE bowls of chips and salsa later . . . she was back with the drinks and took our order.  Another two bowls of chips later . . . the food arrived.  Problem was . . . it was COLD and GREASY.\n\nSaving grace was that we ate enough chips to fill up . . . we definitely not be back.","I have been to Macayo's before and gave it a bad review which You can see in my profile but this time was the complete opposite. I was a little thrown off by the crazy shirts the staff wear but the place was packed and that is normally a great sign. We went with a few friends and we were seated relatively quick. \n\nNow to the reason that a star was lost. Our waitress came around the corner wearing her party animal shirt like everyone else which you would think would put you in an amazing mood, but instead she came around the corner like a communist leader demanding our order and being super impatient and not at all welcoming.. Once we gave Mrs. Marx our order she disappeared and did not come back until the food was ready.  \n(Pow, One star Gone)\n\nThe Saving Grace here was the quality of the chicken Chimichanga that was brought to the table, first of all it was the size of a small baby and second it was probably one of the best chimichangas I have ever had. To me it says something when the food you serve can overpower the horrid service that your servers provide. \n\nI think we will go back from time to time I am just hoping that we dont get Cruella the waitress again.","It says a lot about a place when the best part of your meal was the chips and salsa. The service was very attentive, especially considering the huge party of sixteen she had to attend to (that being us).\n\nThe food, on the other hand, is comparable to a fast food chain. I split a plate of tacos with a friend. The chicken tacos, soft shell, were decent. Literally, I could have gone down the street, and gotten them for cheaper. The rice and beans were sub-standard - nothing special. Other than the chips and salsa, the TCT was another shining point. A huge quesadilla, pizza-esque creation. It was pretty delicious. Authentic on the other hand? Not so much.\n\nIn telling my brother's friends where I was headed off to for dinner, they all had the same response: \"Macayo's? Oh...\". I now understand. It's pretty much a glorified Taco Bell with a cult following.","I dined here with my parents, because they had frequented Macayo's when they were in high school. Unfortunately, this time, they were disappointed and felt that it had gone downhill. I on the other hand had nothing to compare it to. I thought the salmon tacos were so-so; adequate after a lot of margarita, but not great. They did have corn tortillas (thank goodness) but there was no interesting sauce. I don't know if they forgot it, or...? They did make a substitution for me (grilled vegetables for the rice and beans), which was cool. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive. The house margarita was really, really weak but tasted pretty good, so I ordered another margarita, but one of the fancier ones (the \"cowboy\" or the \"Texan\" or some kind of western name) on the rocks. On the rocks turned out to be a giant tub of booze with a few melted ice cubes swimming in it. It was also much, much stronger than the house margarita; like too strong.","Yep, everyone knows Macayo's and loves it.","We had a party of 3 adults and one child (9 yrs).  We enjoyed everything.  The service was satisfactory, the food was good and portions were good for the price paid.  We all took some home for another day.  The salsa was very good as was the guacamole..  I had the steak Cortez and was completely happy.\n\nI would be happy to return for another meal.","I don't often get good mexican food anymore now that I live in Canada - so every time I'm in Vegas, I always head for Macayo's.\n\nOn my first visit last week I ordered my all-time favourite, a Chili Relleno. It wasn't as tasty as the one I had last year, and now rice and beans are an extra cost. I don't know what was different, other than it just wasn't as good as usual. the Relleno sauce seemed different, and I couldn't taste the chili as much as I should.\n\nOn my second visit during the same trip, I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. It was heaven! The chimi was huge, the beef was very flavourful, beans were perfect, it was heaven!\n\nNext trip to Vegas will mean another couple trips to Macayo's for sure!","Well, this place went downhill prettttttty fast. Extracting the information out of our waitress made me feel like a CIA agent ready to water board somebody if they don't disclose what flippin flavors of margarita they offer, but don't print on the regular menu, and no longer have a drink menu....  After a long process of slowly piecing information from her I ordered the Cadillac margarita on the rocks which should be renamed salt water. Beyond that the chips were stale and flavorless, the salsa was watery and gross, the mini sampler appetizer featured an array of frozen mexican food from your local Costco microwaved especially for you. The enchiladas did not justify the clogged artery so I only ate about half of the first one. The server was nice and the guy refilling the water and chips was on the ball...except when he refilled friends root beer with pepsi.","This is the 'Mexican' food I was raised on, peeps.  Macayo's is mother's milk to Vegas natives - at least to really, really Irish Vegas natives who consider the food at Macayo's 'Mexican.'\n\nThe poor waitresses are decked out in pink and blue flowing Mexican stylr dresses that are purely horrid.  They serve up RC cola, which makes me laugh.  The food really ain't that bad, but it really ain't that special either.  The chips and salsa still delight me to this day, though.  And not many things beat getting a TCT.  (Toasted Cheese Tortilla.  It's a giant quesadilla, besically, and they bring it out on a pizza sheet and rest it above the candle on the table that has a constantly low flame and can't really keep it heated anyway.  But man, that there's comfort food.)\n\nI can't help it.  A part of me will always have random cravings for a little Macayo's, no matter how old or high-falutin' I might get.","My best friend loves this place and I really cannot understand why. Every time we have gone, the customer services is awful. They are rude and take forever! They always get the check wrong! She loves the food, I find it to be mediocre. Not bad but not good. Nothing special. Though the prices are reasonable.","On a recent trip to Vega$, I decided to try some local restaurants off \"the Strip\" for a change...partly to experience something new & also because it was a Sat & I detest the \"weekend & holiday\" price gouging at the casinos.  How dare you take such beautiful words as an excuse to jack the price of the buffet line when it's the same weekday food anyway!\n\nDriving down Trop Ave I noticed the banner hanging out front proudly mentioning a \"Best of Las Vegas\" award (albeit from 2010)...but would standards change in that short a time?  Maybe this raised my expectations.\n\nI arrived bout 11:30am & was given the lunch specials menu insert, but decided I would try some breakfast since it was still late morning.\n\nSelection was sorta limited...there were two choices.  Chorizo & eggs & Hueveos Rancheros.  OK, not many choices, but granted they don't open til 11am, so demand for break is probably minimal.\n\nGot the Huevos Ranch.  Just two (small to med sized) eggs on a tortilla...would it break to bank for the ownership to put large or XL eggs on a dish that costs 10 bucks w/tax?\n\nAnd on the side (Wait for It!) some beans (refried) Rice? no. Sour Cream? no. Some cheese sprinkled on the pintos? no.  Maybe a lettuce & tomato garnish on the side? no.  And maybe a pipe dream of a real ranchera sauce stead of the lame canned salsa?\n\nI told the waitress I needed some rice & she obliged...but it was kinda crunchy.  Ok guess the cook hadn't had a chance to cook some fresh stuff for the day & just grabbed what was left from the night before (albeit dried out enough that you could hurt your teeth.)\n\nEven though she didn't charge me for brittle rice, the bill came to nearly 30 bucks w/tax & tip for the huevos, guacamole (3) coffee (3), & albondigas soup (Carrots? no. Sprig of celery? no. Mex chayote squash? pipe dream.) Granted the cook didn't have a total aversion to vegetables...the soup bowl had the equivalent of one onion ring in it.\n\nNot that there's anything wrong w/ dropping 30 for breakfast for one(well maybe there is, but that's a different discussion) but it shouldn't have the minimal garnishments & burnt tasting coffee in one of the supposed culinary capitals of the country.","Wife wanted to go to Macayo for their baja burrito, so we went.\n    I had the poblano chile stuffed with chicken , cheese and covered in baja sauce.  It is deep fried in a crispy breading and it was very good. Almost like a chile relleno , but crispier and IMO better\n      . My wife's favorite is chile relleno and by the way she was eying my food , I know she was kicking herself for not taking my suggestion again and ordering this dish, but I gave her a taste anyway , just to tease her. Lol \n     We also had the green tamale bites as an appetizer ,  it came with Baja sauce.           The tamale bites are sweet masa balls that are deep fried and are addicting.. Service was fine.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food ,We will be back","This place is super popular. They are of the \"extremely generous portions\" school of Mexican food.\n\nNow, I'm a vegetarian, so I have to rely on what my dining partners say about their food, but I LOVE mexican food, so my friend has dragged me here twice.\n\nMy friend cannot handle spice. Seriously, once I put pepper jack in a sandwich and she almost died from heartburn or something. But she LOVES Macayos, probably for the same reason I don't like it too much - I find it bland. Enormous, and cheap ($10 gets you food to last for three meals), but bland. Although I like the salsa and free chips. My other friend liked her taco salad, because she was in a mood for crispy shells. I've had the veggie burrito with sauce (Oh, they don't tell you, but the sauce is $1 extra), the cheese enchiladas (the sides are refried beans, which aren't my fave, but the sauce wasn't very spicy or onion-y), and the veggie fajitas (not bad).\n\nI'd come here again, but only because my best friend loves the place.","My roommate LOVES the shredded beef baja enchilada with extra baja sauce. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't exactly wow me either.\n\nWhat did stand out was that the waiter refilled our waters regularly (which Ryan really appreciates). He also refilled our chips right before we even finished! Granted, it was slow in the restaurant, but I heard that the service was rather poor... so it was nice to see that today was an exception for us.\n\n20% Rebel Discount!","Growing up in Arizona, I have eaten at Macayos a number of times, throughout Phoenix and Tucson. It is a favorite stop for our kids, namely because of the ambience. You don't feel uncomfortable if the kids get a little noisy.\n\nFrom that perspective, this one did not disappoint. However, the recipes at this location were a little different. Most notably, everything was a little less spicy. I usually order the \"hot\" salsa to go with my chips, as well as a baja chimi. Based on my experience in AZ, I expected them to be relatively spicy. Instead, they were pretty bland.","Macayo's is a restaurant that I have been to many times throughout my entire childhood. When seated you are met with chips, along with a mild and hot salsa. This location is great as it is close the the UNLV campus. The down side is the service is slow, and never ever friendly. It seems as though ever time I have been to this location I am lucky to get a water refill, and I am never greeted with a smile during anytime of my meal. It seems as though I am always \"bothering\" the server. \n\nThis visit I got the fish tacos, with a chipotle sauce. The lunch portion is great, giving you two tacos for less than $11. I do not eat the beans or anything else, so I am not a fair judge there. Other than the food, this particular location as become known to me for their bad service.\n\nIf you are looking for a typical Mexican restaurant, and are prepared to wait patiently for refills and service, this is a great place to grab a bite to eat.","Located in the University hood. Macayo Vegas serves pretty good Mexican chow.\nI had the enchilada sampler, which was good, but not quite a \"WOW\" experience.\n\nTheir chips and salsa are pretty good, their frozen margaritas are pretty good, the service is pretty good, etc. \n\nI would return and try something else on the menu, but would not go out of my way to go here.  \n\nNot bad, but personally, I prefer Lindo Michoacan on East DI.\n\nC+","This is the worst Mexican restaurant. Chips were stale, the quality of food is trash so disappointed. El pollo loco is better then this. I recommend the word authentic to be out of there menu.","I am quite snarky when it comes to considering Mexican food outside of my home state of Texas.  My coworker is obsessed with Macayo's, mainly because she is a Vegas native and grew up eating here.  She is really fond of it.  The restaurant itself is very large, and boasts a UNLV discount but it does not apply to any of the specials and we only go at lunch so I am not sure if it really works.\n\nIt is located right next to Metro Pizza off Tropicana just east of Maryland so it is easy to get to from campus.  All celebrations surrounding her happen here, so I have eaten here more than I expected to ever.  There are plenty of reasonably priced, filling lunch specials - a whole large menu page of them - but I always stick with the combinations.  There is a choice of one or two items for $8.59 or $9.59 and it comes with rice and beans or double of whatever one (I get double rice), plus a small shredded lettuce and diced tomato garnish.  The choices include chile rellenos, enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and probably a few other options.  \n\nI typically stick with the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale covered in spicy tomatillo sauce which is quite wonderful.  These items are covered in cheese so if you are not big on cheese, let them know.  I am never wowed by the meal but it is a good average Mexican meal if you are craving one.  I can justify anything covered in green sauce and I can assure you can find something on the menu to satisfy you here.  Service is hit or miss.  Today lunch was smooth and very fast.  Complimentary chips and 2 salsas are included.  Remember, guac makes everything better but costs extra!","We've eaten our fair share of Mexican food here in Las Vegas, and this was one of the first places we tried.  It's consistently good, and not very expensive.  This was the first time for this location, and on a Sunday afternoon, not very busy.  \n\nWe ordered the green chili bites as an app and they were so good.  I got the baja burrito which I love because of the sauce.  I could eat that on just about anything.  \n\nThe food was fresh, hot, spiced just right and the service was swift, definitely a return visit is in order.","I've been here many times over the years. Not bad.","Standard Mexican food.\nGood location near the T&M if you're going to a game.\nFair prices.\nTasty chips & salsa.\nMediocre service.\nThe TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) was a staple in my childhood at the Phoenix Macayo's, and still holds a special place in my heart!","After class, I was picked up and taken away.  Surprise surprise.. They brought me to get a log.\n\nI have driven pass this place multiple times and never took the time to stop by.  My first thought, 20% off for UNLV Students.. Score!\n\nWe came in for lunch, not too packed.  Very decent crowd for a weekday of course.  Place was very open ended.  Lots of tables and booths available.  We grabbed a booth and of course a bowl of chips and salsa arrived on cue.  Tasty chips, less salt, salsa was a little weak for me.  I need that hot stuff!  \n\nLots of options for lunch of course with a special lunch price.  We all got different items.  I got the lunch burro (log).. Our server was very kind enough to have the cook put cheese on top so it was more appealing and looked more like a chimichanga.  At first sight.. I didn't think I would finish.. But, after a several bites and hot sauce.. I cleaned up pretty well.  No togo box necessary.  Shredded beef was delicious and the oozing cheese was wonderful.  Served on a hot plate of course.  I took a peek at what my friends had, very nice picks.  Plates look delicious as well.  May be a little less than what I was having of course.  They went with the 2 item options where they could pick up a taco, enchilada, tamale, etc.  But if you are an eater like me, better stick with the burro.  \n\nService was on top.. I truly mean it because my water cup was constantly being refilled.  She offered to add syrup flavors to my friends lemonades.  Very nice of her and the fact that she offered to redo it if it doesn't turn out good.  \n\nOverall, I would come back to try out the other items.  Place had some slot machines and video poker.  Fire place was a nice touch.  I also noticed a bar area on the way out.

{"reviews":["Amazing Atmosphere, music videos that were from my childhood, oh ya....THE FOOD! Eveerything about this place made me thankful our drunken stooper led us in this direction! YOU CAN'T GO WRONG when you find Mamacita's. This instantly became a regular stop, when","I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. I walked in and they took about 10 min to bring us the menu, I was then waiting for another 15 min and no one came to get our order so we had to walk away. There were only  about four tables and plenty of staff to take care of us. \nmenu: large menu \nservices: Terrible!! \nprep time:  unknown (I'm sure they take forever 2)\natmosphere:  old looking decorations, thumbs down\nBest Thing:  Free chips and salsa\nother comments: During the weekend they play Latin music, so If you feel like shaking your hips you can check this place out!","Horrible service!!. If I had known they were shut down by the health dept., wouldn't have come here. Waited 15 min for the waitress and it wasn't even busy.  The table next to us waited forever and when they asked for more chips, they were charged for them. We had to get up and get our own refills. Stay away and find another place to eat!!  Didn't even want to leave a 1 star but there's no lower rating!!","I went to Fremont Street hoping to finally try LeThai. But as is my luck with any Tony Hsieh supported business I had another bad experience as LeThai was closed. So I head back to the parking garage at the El Cortez hungry and wondering what to do. I step out of the elevator and see Mamacita's. Or is it Mamita's? Heck if I know, it's Mexican food, my second most favorite thing except pizza. I punch the down button, a couple steps through the casino and across Fremont has me inside waiting on someone to help me. \n\nMamacita's is s-l-o-w. Like the polar ice caps will be melted by the time they get to you slow. I grabbed a seat and waited to get a menu. I waited to get salsa, which by the way they brought chips and a medium and a hot salsa, both of which were good. I waited to finally get someone to take my order. Meanwhile I'm sitting there facing Fremont St. watching ESPN on the flat screen on the wall and waiting some more. Finally I get my lunch special, a taco, enchilada, rice, and beans. They used regular beans, not dehydrated beans which was a surprise of sorts. The taco was crispy but had me relying heavily on the salsa to make it good. And everything else was just ho-hum. \n\nI also ordered ice tea, which was good but they brought out the sugar tray and all it had in it was artificial sweetners. I'm sorry but I only do real sugar when I'm out, or Xyla at home, I won't use anything else. So not having real sugar on the table was something I didn't like. \n\nI got a phone call so I had to leave and it took forever to get someone's attention and to get my check. I tried to hand my server my debit card but she ignored it, went up and printed my ticket then came back and got it. Seriously, I needed to go at that point, when I tell you to just run the damn card, run the damn card. \n\nIf I was on Fremont Street and hungry I might come back here again. But if you're on a tight lunch hour this is NOT a place you even want to consider. They take slow to a whole other place and it's not good. Also decor wise it's kinda cool but the 80's music and other crap gets old very quickly. \n\n2 Stars: It's just not all that.","DO NOT RECCOMEND!!\n\nChimichangas were hard as a rock.\nChips & Salsa was free. \nService is eh & the decor is dreadful.\nAlso they have a DJ posted by the window?\nWhy? Not sure, I guess they want me to suffer through pit bull songs while I complain about my crap tacos. Downtown has some good spot, this is NOT one of them.","We definitely didn't come in for the Bee Gees music but we definitely left because of it. Although my breaded steak was ok, my orange juice was straight from a bottle, and the music video with all your favorite easy listening bands just didn't do it for me. In fact, they made things worse by turning up the music as we ate, even though there was only six people in the restaurant. We ended up running for our lives out of here.","Horrible, bad don't eat here. Staff doesn't care about service or quality of food","Its downtown, expect to see some creepy creepies and the usual degenerates. The food is freaking awesome!!!!! Service is ok. If you want a classy joint, of 5 star service go somewhere else. Everyone that expects more from this place other than delicious food is an idiot. I go here all the time, and recommend it to everyone. Shrimp fajitas are out of control!","I want to give Mamacita's a good review and it wasn't for lack of trying as I live Downtown, but I can't.. But basically I'd have to say the quality and freshness of the food and also the servie staff leave a lot to be desired. I had the huevos ranchero, and the portion's were poor for the price and the ranchero sauce was not fresh and the rice was cold. I tried it again and had a cuban sandwich and plantain's. The plantain's were undercooked on the inside and overcooked on the outside and flavorless,  the cuban was OK but the bread was dry. I gave it one more try walking home one night and decided maybe I should be going after their more expensive signature dishes. I went for the pork and ended throwing most it out after I choked down a few bites. It was super dry with no rub and lightly nuked. All in all there are much better places to eat that care about the quality of the food and service.","I really want to like this place but... \n \nThe service really leaves something to be desired, I think we confused the server by ordering appetizers because our entrees came out before our appetizers.  When we asked about them she seemed really confused that we actually wanted to have them before our meals.  When our meals finally arrived, my friend got her meal plus they put the appetizer in front of her but I did not get my meal.  So we just ate the appetizers.  I finally got my meal after inquiry. Also, the waitresses are quite surly.\n\nThe food leaves something to be desired as well.  The bread for the cuban sandwich was very dry and very flaky.  Very peculiar and hard to eat.\n\nOverpriced and it is a hassle to use their bathroom.  You have to ask for a key and then walk down a sketchy outside hallway in the back of the restaurant.  My advice:  Try to hold it until the El Cortez across the street.","Recently we were in Vegas for a little getaway. On our last night there we had a craving for Mexican food. I googled Mexican eateries downtown and Mamacita's popped up. Of course I Yelped it and the reviews were generaly positive so we decided to go. It was a short walm from our hotel downtown. Even tough Mamacita's is close to the heart of Freemont St., Mamacita's is in a neighborhood filled with panhandlers. Even whe. We arrived at Mamacita's, there was a guy sleelping in a booth which the waitress called security on. I guess she had warned him about sleeping but he didn't heed her advice. However, security arrived quickly and whisked the sleepy guy away. \nThe fresh salsa at Mamacita's is delicious. It has a wonderful flavor and is just the right amount of hot. They have a large menu filled with many Mexican as well as Cuban selections. The tortillas were cold and hard, but I enjoyed my meal anyway. Besides that, I was surprised by the lack of good Mexican eateries in Las Vegas.  Living in San Diego they are a dime a dozen. I guess I'm spoiled. But if you're in Vegas, hungry for Mexican (or Cuban) food, and  have a sense of adventure, Mamacita's might be the place for you!","My friend Karen had seen this restaurant and had made mental note that she wanted to give it a shot. \n\nWe decided this is where we would do dinner last night, before hitting up the Western for $1 shots and beers and then to Dino's for Karaoke. \n\nWow where do I start? \n\nWaited about 15 minutes until we were finally approached for a drink order, let alone questions regarding the menu. I had never had Cuban food at a restaurant so I was a bit clueless on what certain things were. \n\nI asked the waitress what the house specialty is or what is ordered the most and or popular, she then points out a few things on the menu and says this is OK, um that is OK. Well you know what lady, I am looking for more than just \"OK\". \n\nCrappy service for starters, after finally coming to take our order it took another 15 minutes or so to get our drinks. The food took forever, and only two of four meals were brought. So I am sitting waiting until my friends food comes so I can eat. I said screw it, my fajitas are getting cold waiting so I dug in! \n\nAfter the non helpful suggestions from the waitress, I decided to play it safe and ordered the beef and chicken fajitas which came with a side plate of rice and beans. The fajitas were a large portion of dry unseasoned chicken and beef. Not much flavor at all to speak of. I have had better fajitas at El Torito's. Disappointment for me as even the rice and beans were bland, very bland! \n\nFriend #1 ordered a bowl of menudo, she said the flavor was not the best and she is an old school menudo eater. She asked the waitress prior if it their menudo had a red or white base, the waitress pulled the menu and pointed to the picture and said that is what it looks like. Also her plate was a sloppy mess when it arrived, menudo juice all over the plate and running down the side of the bowl, the presentation was just bad. I know they were rushing to get orders out but there is just no excuse for that slop to be dropped at anyone's table. I attached a picture, check it out.\n\nFriend #2 got the Tequila pollo dish with a side order of chile releno. The chicken was one big slab on the plate, would have made a better eater friendly and a visually appealing meal had they sliced it. The portion was generous but did not matter as the taste once again was bland as the other dishes we tried. \n\nFriend #3 got some sort of beef dish that was nothing but grizzle, all she was able to eat was the white rice and the black beans she spit up. Literally had a plate of wasted meat left. She probably should have sent it back as was basically inedible. The service was slow, and not very friendly, did not seem like a good outcome if a complaint was issued, I think that is the vibe we felt. Still I would have issued my complaint as they can not improve something if they are not aware or getting the complaint. \n\nService and food very disappointing. \n\nThe tab was $80.00 for four of us for bad service and plain, unflavored food. We will NOT be back. \n\nAlso the flat screen TV blasting the Michael Jackson videos, over and over and over and over and over was overkill. We could not hear each other so we had very little conversation between the four of us. \n\nA hilarious moment, the waitress walked past our table and because the music video was soooooo freakin loud the waitress did not even hear my friend calling her! We just wanted to ask if they could turn it down. Several other patrons were talking about it as well. Ok they were not talking about it as I could not hear anyone, I mean I was lip reading along with watching people point to their ears so I am assuming they were thinking the same as we were that the music was way too loud. Don't get me wrong...music is my life but when I dine I am not really down for a taped concert at the same time. It was ridiculous how loud it was.\n\nThis place sucks balls...and not the good kind! \n\nThis place just gave reason for a bitch fest that night from my friends, and they are not even Yelpers! I never want to endure that again!\n\nThey should also train their employees on cuban food, not cool for a specialty restaurant to have staff that is clueless in regards to the menu.\n\nService sucks \nPoor food \nPricey","Well it was clean and the food quality was ok, but very bland.  Had all the flavor of a lean cuisine Service was friendly but very slow even though there were only 5 customers. The prices are high for Cuban /mex especially for the neighborhood.  Possibly the worst mojito I've ever had.  Not even worth a second chance.  Gets the second star for the cheesy spanish language videos.","So-so...","So is this place called Mamita's or Mamacita's?!?! \n\nWhen you walk into this dump it's like Vegas and Mexico threw up on each other or something like that, it's very interesting to say the least. \nIt's right across the street from El Cortez hotel, so that alone should give you a clue of what kind of place this is going to be lol. \n\nI noticed this place because I was outside on the curb of El Cortez waiting in line for my Punk Rock Bowling tickets in 90 degrees at 11am, drinking some hot Jack n coke in a plastic cup. My friend and I were debating whether to eat here or the cafe, and ended up here. I think at this point I would eaten anything lol. \n\nSince I was in Vegas I started off with a strawberry margarita, because well, I really love margaritas. Also, it is completely acceptable to keep drinking all day, even before noon in Vegas, so why the hell not. I then ordered a chicken taco and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans. It was probably not the best Mexican food, but it really hit the spot and plus they gave me a decent amount of sour cream, so I devoured that plate, lol. \n\nMy friend ordered a Cuban sandwich and beer, but they were out of Cuban beer, so fail right there. Also, his sandwich came on some questionable bread, so yea overall fail on the Cuban menu. The bread in the picture looked way better. Overall, my food was pretty good, but my friend's not so good. \n\nThe service was also pretty terrible, they take forever to take your order, get your order, and if you need anything else after your meal finally arrives, forget about it!!!! They weren't even that busy until maybe the end our meal. This place is cheap and convenient though if you happen to be in Downtown Vegas. \n\nApparently that Selena live in concert DVD is constantly playing, which is only awesome the first time through.","It's a cute place but I've had better food.\n\nI walk in and the place is decorated with everything Vegas and Mexico. From Elvis, shot glasses to Chiuauas, etc. \n\nI had a side order of their chile relleno. Meh... Nothing special. It wasn't bad but I'd had WAY better at my Mexican friend's house when she makes it herself.\n\nThe highlight of the night was the huge flat screen that was playing old school R&B music videos. As a big fans of eras past, we decided to stick around a little longer just to watch the vids.\n\nWould we return? No, not really. But if we were in the area and were craving the cuisine, we'd stop in.","I was excited to get me one of them Cuban sandwiches. The bread was nothing to write home about, but it was ok.\n\nThey charged me $9 for a $5.95 Cuban sandwich. I asked the server if she charged me for 2 sandwiches cuz the menu indicates the price of $5.95. The lady then gave me $3. \n\nI asked my buddy's roommate about the place and he said, \"F@#k that place. They charged me $20 for the food and drink. The actual price was $12. \n\nI recommend that you add the bill yourself before you get over charged. Check your bill before paying.\n\nMamacita, either learn to add or stop ripping off customers. Yelp is here to help.","I used to love the Cuban food at this restaurant.  Not any more.  I don't know if the ownership changed, but it's now called \"Mamita's\" and the chef clearly doesn't know how to cook.  Moreover, the service was incredibly slow and bad.  I ordered the masas de puerco fritas, and it arrived dry.  I asked for garlic sauce, and ten minutes later, the chef sent out a bowl of onions in oil.  Terrible service, worse cooking.  Too bad. Stay away.","Pan con bisteca is great and garlicy with nice charred onions. Good service, friendly folks.  And it's right on the neon museum.","Ok it's true, it's not on the best stretch of road in Vegas.   However, the food makes it worth the trek.  My wife and I were in Vegas for a few days and I think we ate breakfast here three times, that's how good it was.  Other than a fair price and good service.  The breakfast was so filling I usually didn't eat again until 4pm or 5pm.  We would have the Cuban or Mexican breakfast consisting of rice, eggs, beans, bread, plantains or a similar variation.   Believe it or not, the coffee was excellent.  I hear the secret is a little cinnamon thrown in when they  brew it.  Next time we hit Vegas Mamacita's will be on our list of places to eat.  Hopefully by then they'll stop running the same Selena live DVD.","Like other reviews have noted, expect horrible service.\nLocated off Fremont street by a couple of blocks, in a seedy area. Expect crack heads and crazy homeless folks around here.\nI had a Cuban sandwich that contained chicken instead of beef, but was still good. Hot salsa and chips. Sandwich cane with fries, but why have fries when you can have chips and salsa instead?\nOverall, decent food in bad surroundings with bad service.\nBonus points for having Michael Jackson videos on to eat to.","I've been here a few times since the initial review and the food has been marginal.  Guess I'll avoid for a while.  Bummer.","My wife and I ate here over a year ago, and I was very disappointed in the meal.  I agree that for the price, I'd expect a nicer place with better service and not an entrance from the parking lot that is like a service entrance.\n\nThe food was nothing special.  It is an amalgam, and that's not what we were looking for.  We wanted good Cuban food.  Not here.  This is the one food area where Las Vegas is really lacking.","Michael Jackson makes for surprisingly good music to eat their food to.","Might not B a 3 star, but gotta balance out all those crazy 4 stars!  Is OK to good, kinda pricey 10-15 or more... There's gotta B better in the LV! Should I try the Barrio? If this is the best LV has for Mexican/cuban, I feel for them! Help yelp!","i went to this place after i checked out the pictures i have taken of vegas so far, and the sole decision to see the freemont street experience.\n\ni went to freemont street a couple of days ahead, but i didnt see the canopy of lights, so i went back.\n\nwell, on first impression, the place looks very authentic. but the weird smell (i have super smelling powers) kinda turned me off. two girls walked in and i asked them if they ever ate there - they said no but it was highly recommended by the robocop (he was a cop on a segway.)\n\nthe service was a bit slow  - but there was only one waitress, and i dont really blame her. the food was good. it didnt taste americanized to me, but thats my opinion. its almost close to what i have back in queens, NY.\n\nthe food here is a welcome and homey change to the food they serve at the strip by the venetian. aaaah. it felt like home. the porkchops were good. \n\ni loved the waitress gisela because she was the only service person in vegas who didnt expect a tip.","Loved this place. Food was delicioso. Atmosphere caliente! Very close to Fremont Street. Go here!!","I've been here four times and enjoyed every visit.  Good food, good service, good prices.  The menu is fairly diverse, but still features dishes you would find at just about any Mexican restaurant.  Good for a late night bite if you happen to be in the down town/ Fremont St area.","No. Just. No. \n\nThe decor was a little loud for my taste, and the same Selena dvd was played three times while we were there, which got old real fast. It's also not in the best part of town, but hey, it happens. \n\nThe food was good, I'll give them that. I ordered the ropa vieja, and enjoyed it, or would have if they'd gotten the order right. It states quite clearly on the menu that ropa vieja comes with papas fritas (french fries). My plate came with white steamed rice and a bowl of beans. When I asked the waitress politely about my fries, she told me (rudely) that my meal did not come with fries. I protested, saying it was on the menu, and she told me outright that I was wrong, and walked away. I had no menus handy or I would have showed her. Half the reason I ordered what I did was because I was craving some french fries. I don't think I've ever been told flat out that I was WRONG at a restaurant before. Not only that, but we ordered ONE pitcher of margaritas, but she brought out another over the course of the meal, which we did not drink or order. These margaritas were awful. I don't think they used real tequila. No one at our table finished a glass. Then we were told we were being charged $24 a pitcher, when we hadn't even touched the other pitcher. Um. No. \n\nNot only that, but we had a rather large party. I understand that this can be difficult for small restaurants. However, when we arrived, there was only one other table occupied. But people who came in after us starting receiving their food before a quarter of the people at our table received their meals. Come on! You don't serve the new orders before you've gotten the first table done! \n\nOther people at my table got the wrong food, too. My father-in-law can't eat cheese, and so he specifically requested NO CHEESE in the enchiladas or on the beans. He received cheese on both and had to send it back. \n\nThe service here was AWFUL. The waitress was surly and never available except when she brought a plate of food out (which was once every ten minutes). I absolutely DO NOT recommend this place, especially if you have a group of people over four. Too bad, cause the food is good.","While staying at the El Cortez Hotel for the 2009 NASCAR races, my buddy mentioned that there was a little Mexican-Cuban restaurant directly across the street that he wanted to try out. I am so thankful that he suggested Mamacita's!\n\nI ordered the #5 combo, a Chile Relleno so delicious that I couldn't stop raving about the flavor in between each bite. Also included was a fried carnitas taco that was fatty & flavorful - a great combination at $10.95. \n\nWhat also set this place apart was the large LCD TV playing a video of Elvis Presley bringing down the house. Great DVD, great sound! On my second visit alone, I ordered the same dinner, plus two ice cold Coronas, while watching a DVD of the greats from the disco era.\n\nProbably the only reason that I would stay at the El Cortez Hotel again is that the hotel is so perfectly situated to this little restaurant - check it out!","With a stroke of luck I randomly strolled into this place after getting hungry walking up Fremont street.  There were a couple of shady-looking characters wandering about outside, but where in Vegas are there not?\n\nMy girl ordered shrimp cocktail and the papano fajita platter (I think that was the name).  I was going to order the chimichanga dinner but the lady told us we were getting too much food so I canceled the chimi and sure enough, the shrimp cocktail and cuban fajita platter were plenty for two.  Really, really tasty.  The service wasn't great but the food and price more than made up for it.\n\nWe went twice.  On the second visit, I finally did get the chimichanga and it was perfect.  We also tried their \"old laundry\" Cuban soup (ropa vieja) which was awesome, and fried platains which were great.  \n\nThis place has a great \"down home\" feel.","So good! I will always go here whenever I am in town because it is always worth it. I will try to be brief...\n\nThe GOOD:  My food has always been excellent.  The flavors are delicious, the spices are right, the portion sizes are good, but not overwhelming. I love Tex-Mex and Real Mex and have tasted it all and this is really good but not the best. The Cuban food is good also, but it is not for me.   \n\nThe BAD: Service has always been ridiculous in my experience.  I have had servers who were either friendly yet incompetent or servers who were evil and glaring yet bringing me my food and drinks in a timely manner. (Honestly, both of these are fine with me as long as I get my food.)","This was by far one of the worst Vegas restaurant experiences that I have had.  My husband and I are addicted to Mexican/Cuban food, and we finally decided to give this dirty lookin little place a try.  There were 2 bums laying on the sidewalk outside the resturant.  There were a group of mexican guys sitting in the corner with buckets of beer in front of each of them- they were watching some Mexican soccer game... a disco ball in the front window ... so far so good, lol.\n\nWe got two Negro Medolo's, a steak burrito, and a CHICKEN enchilada ala carte.  The menu said \"add an enchilada to a combo for $1.95\"  the server told us that it was no longer the special, it was now 2.95 to add an enchilada.  We told her that was fine.  I can't eat a whole lot when I'm having a beer ;)  \n\nThe food didn't take too long... after she drops it off, we don't see her again till the \"bill\" comes... \n\nThe burrito was actually really good... huge portions too.  The \"chicken\" enchilada turned out to be a cheese enchilada... so I didn't eat that.  No biggie... except the server was gone for 20 minutes.  We started to think she went home or something...  \n\nAfter we set our plates to the side, the other girl working finally came over to take the plates.   We told her, that we got the wrong enchilada, no biggie, and we don't want another one.  At that point, our food and beer had settled and theres no way i could eat anymore.  She said she would tell our server...\n\nSo, our server finally comes back over with a tablet she had written our checks on (apparently, she never shows us a check) and tells us that will be $30.\n\nLOL.  What?   $30 dollars for one burrito and two beers?  The burrito itself, was 9.95.  She continues to go over her calculations, $5.75 for the beers, $3.50 for the enchilada [[[stop!  first, we got an enchilada we didn't order - and sent it back... but do you remember she told us the enchilada was now 2.95?  She's making these prices up as she goes, i beleive]]]\n\nWe told her we got the wrong enchilada... she says \"i dunno, you eat it\"  Uh.... no, we told her we didn't, we sent it back... (which she would have known if she had been back to the table even once after the food had arrived)  She stomps away, to ask the other girl ... our server stomps off to the kitchen and we see her arguing with some guy in the kitchen.   She walks back over and says \"okay, now 27 dollar\"\n\n\nWe were so disturbed by the arguing and extremely rude service, we just wanted to leave, and didn't think about how that added up, we just gave her money and left.   If i had been paying, i would have stiffed her.  I've never in my life stiffed a server.  I worked in restaurants for 7 years, husband was a bartender for 4+yrs, we tip VERY WELL!!  \n\nAfter we got back to Freemont i start thinking.  So... 9.95 for the burrito, and - 17 dollars for the two negro medelos?!?  what ?!  \n\nHusband seems to remember her saying the beers were 5.75 a peice.  Thats 11.50... 11.50+9.95=  $22.95\n\nSo that means all the porn slappers sitting in the corner had 40 dollar bucks of beer sitting in front of each of them?  I'm sure.  Did she think we were drunk and wouldn't realize we were getting ripped off?  \n\nSince we never got a check, and she seemed to keep changing her prices every time she came back to the table, I'm sure she pocketed a good bit of our payment.  Whata fuckin shame, I really liked the burrito.  I would NEVER step foot in this place again.  I can't imagine making your customers feel so uncomfortable.. \n\nIf you still need to go here, check the menu for the prices, and ask for a check at the end...  Maybe she added a 5 dollar plate share fee??  that would be a high plate share fee - especially for a dirty little mexican place in the ghetto!!  Even so, I wasn't planning on eating the damn burrito- I ordered ONE enchilada, (i don't eat much at night, and theres no point in ordering food that I won't eat!) Either way, its poor buisness practice... \n\n I've never felt the need to call a restaurant's manager, until this experience... but i figured what would the point be?  I don't think any of them spoke english.... and if they did, would they even care?  They don't care that they employ a theif... geez.. I was trying to not bring in a stereotype, but damn... :-x\n\n\nI think we paid for half the beer for the mexican guys in the corner?  who knows...","so good!\nI had the Cuban steak with onions, black beans and rice, it was perfect. I ordered a side of plantains that was enough for the whole table to share and they came with sour cream, my favorite. other people in my party ordered Mexican fare and truly enjoyed it. portions were large and reasonably priced.\nThe salsa and tortilla cheaps were outstanding.\nEveryone agreed that this was quite possibly the best meal for the best price  in Vegas. \nFree parking across the street in the el cortez casino, no wait for a table, quick and delicious!","I've eaten here over 20 times, for over 10 years. not anymore, since my magic mentor has diabetes, partially because of too many chile rellenos from Mamacitas--yum!\nthe food is consistent, amazing, authentic. Wow.","Wow!\n\nGlad to see the good reviews, I made my maiden voyage in March '07 and thought it was fantastic, but I was DDDDDD-runk.  Made a follow-up visit in December '07 and was happy to find the food to be just as good when sober.\n\nDelicious food and cool atmosphere, although  I could do without the Carlos Santana blaring at 90 decibels.  I like my Carlos as much as the next guy, but it was a bit much. \n\nI've tried both Mexican and Cuban entrees, and you really can't go wrong with either.  Inexpensive, tasty food.  Great service.  An economically diverse clientele.  What more could one ask for?\n\nMr. Santana takes it down from 5 stars to 4.4 stars for me.\n\nDon't walk any further east, it's kind of dangerous, especially at night.  But Mamacita's is a must if you're hungry and on Fremont - it's a required stop for me on future visits.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nUpdate:  March 2008\n\nThey've turned down the music.  Thank you, God.  I enjoyed the same Carlos Santana videos, but at about 50% of the volume of my previous visits.  Food is still very good!","Everyone has been raving about this place, and we couldn't wait to try it. Located off off the strip on Fremont Street across the street from the El Cortez Hotel, (We parked there!) we were surprised to find it relatively empty at 9pm. (It was a FREEZING night!) \n\nFor this one, I'm going to go with listing the Pluses and Minuses: \n\n(+)\n+ Easy Parking, across the street at the El Cortez\n+ Roomy, good for groups\n+ Cheeeep eats! Huge portions! \n\n(-) \n- What was the *DEAL* with them BLASTING the Eagles DVD and then after that the BRITNEY DVD on HIGH VOLUME at 9:30PM on a Monday night? I was running low on energy at that point in the evening and the volume was reaaaaaaly too high for me, cranky ol' lady. I hear they usually play salsa music, which is would have much preferred (not hatin' on the Eagles, actually.) \n- It was Freeeeezing in there- we sat near the window, perhaps that was why? Bring a sweater if you're coming here for dinner in winter-time. \n- The meals arrived ~20 minutes after we sat down, which is fine, but the plates were SUPER COLD to the touch... for those of you who know how much I love my food PIPING DANGEROUSLY HOT, this was a minus for me. \n\nOverall: a solid 3.75 stars, as the food was tasty tasty and it's a great deal on some Quality food. Service was friendly, and they let us sit around a few minutes after they closed, as we were just engaged in catching up.","Once in a while, miracles happen to me. It's often while I'm traveling, which is probably because (a) you're in a more desperate, survivalist state when you don't have your bearings and therefore unexpected discoveries seem more miraculous, and (b) when I travel I visit almost exclusively the historic downtown core of any place, which is usually where everything magical resides. \n\nNow, I may be the only person in the world who travels to Las Vegas to visit the historic downtown core, but this is who I am and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it. Also, fuck the Strip. It's the same shitty middleamerican crowd, it's just more expensive and larger scale, which are shitty middleamerican things anyway.\n\nBack to the historic downtown core thing, they appear to be doing some civic redevelopment stuff in the \"East Fremont Street\" area. So when LB and I were traipsing around in the 105 degree heat admiring historic neon signs and abandoned wedding chapels, and we noticed a big sign across from the El Cortez for \"MEX/CUBAN FOOD\", I knew immediately that a travel miracle was upon us. And it was. \n\nFirst of all, it is the cutest fucking place you have ever seen. From the neon signage to the bright pink and gold chairs and pleather booths to the waitresses' dresses, it makes you want to kill yourself for ever having eaten at a crappy Chevy's. It's the real deal. It also has a giant big screen TV upon which we witnessed the following: latin music videos on \"htv\" (hispanic tv? anyway, h-urbano was our favorite channel), music videos featuring booty shaking ladies and armadillos, and - this is for real - a DVD concert series of recent performances by KC & the Sunshine Band, Wild Cherry, and the Trammps. Now, if you know me, you know that disco music is the way to my heart. So Mamacita's, you had me at Play That Funky Music Whiteboy. But I'm not sure you had the large Mexican family eating at pushed-together tables, because they were not stoked when you turned off the Urbano. Also, I should add that the sound system is first rate, and I think at night it turns into a dance club. Sweet.\n\nSo, we also learned, \"Mex/Cuban\" does not mean a mishmosh of two cuisines. Apparently the owner (?) is Mexican, and her husband is Cuban, which means they have two distinct menus, one for each cuisine. Which results in more delicious choices for you, the customer. I would recommend ordering everything under \"side orders\" and a Cuban Sandwich. That's what I did. You may want to play it more on the healthy side and order the vegetarian fajitas, or the avocado salad. I know this because I ate those, too. Also, make sure to get the yuca. It comes two ways: fried, and in an oily roasted garlic sauce. I mean, you might as well get both of those, too. I'm not going to lie and say we didn't.  You can also get an entire roasted tilapia, if that's your thing. We actually didn't order that. \n\nAnyway, the point is that the food in Vegas is so generally shitty that when you're ready for a meal that doesn't involve processed lunch meat or $0.99 shrimp cocktail, Mamacita's is there for you, so be ready to EAT.\n\nAlso, the ladies serving you are pretty much the nicest people I've ever met, so if you are one of those assholes that is rude to cab drivers and waitstaff, please don't go in here because I will be forced to break knees.\n\nThe customer base is eclectic. A nice mix of latin families, oddly misplaced white people and the local street characters, of which there seem to be many on this part of East Fremont. On the walk back to the hotel I was asked if my ethnic heritage includes Russian by a dude smoking a doob in plain sight, and I'm pretty sure I saw Aileen Wuornos order a burrito. But something about it was way less scary than the nasty hooker trash at the Palms.","If this place were crack cocaine*, I'd snort it.  In short, magical happiness in the form of a Mexican/Cuban restaurant in downtown Vegas.  Believe it.  \n\n*Also, crack is whack.

{"reviews":["Whenever I visit my parents down in Vegas, we always try to make a stop at Robertos. Both the chicken and shredded beef tacos are good. The chicken taco are actually really good when you buy them on a Wednesday as they are on sale for $.99 (regularly priced at $2.39).","The food here is usually good but the service is terrible. I waited 30 minutes today for a simple burrito because the staff didn't put my order in. I explained (politely) that I had to get to work and would just like my money back. They refused and kept telling me that it was coming any minute. When it finally showed up in the middle of my last request for a refund the girl said \"Whatever.\" I through the food in the trash and went somewhere else - I will never come here again and advise anyone in a hurry to reconsider this place. If you have 30 minutes to wait and don't mind the rude staff go for it.","Simply put, after stopping here once, I've never stepped into a Chipotle again. Authentic Mexican food, incredibly delicious, and all at amazingly affordable prices. \n\nThe carne asada burrito is a home run every single time. It comes standard with guac and pico de gallo, but I usually add rice/refried beans, cheese, and sour cream, and still pay less than for what I'd pay for a burrito at Chipotle. \n\nYou know what the best part about Roberto's is? THEY'RE OPEN 24 HOURS!!! So if you're coming home late from Tao or XS or whatever may have you, this is the place to stop in to satisfy those late night cravings. \n\nGreat food, great prices, great staff!!!","Not much for real or good Mexican Food in this neighborhood.  Roberto's may be good if you fighting a hangover or desperate for some Mexican.  But if I had to choose I will take Del Taco, Taco Bell or Drive across town for some authentic.  The restaurant are always clean - so here's an extra star","tastest damn great. Love this place. Only drawback is most of the menu is very caloric, but otherwise, it rocks!","Great location with nice outdoor patio seating, always good food and fast service. Salsa bar is always stocked and the salsa's are always amazing!","I love the burrito breakfast!! Test like heaven!!","I love Roberto's in general, but this particular location is FABULOUS. The staff is friendly and helpful with good attitudes. The eating area is huge and there are tables outside as well. But the best thing is the speed. They are ridiculously fast with getting out the orders. I eat here all the time and my orders have always been perfect with no mistakes. If you are in the area and you like Roberto's, this is definitely the location to go to.","We were pleasantly surprised. The space is a little peculiar. It feels like a 70s throwback. That aside, they were very friendly, clean and the food came quickly. Taste was good, no ill after effects and reasonable prices. Horchata was pretty good too.","I stop there every day for breakfast as it is open at 4AM and they dont mind I bring my bike in, which is cool. I have the breakfast burrito which is awesome.","Gone so far downhill, they should just close this location. Had probably the worst Carne Asada Burrito any place in Vegas has ever served!\nShould have been suspicious when it was ready in like 90 seconds. They worst re-overheated Leather Beef Jerky that I have ever tried to chew!\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE!","Roberto's was definitely a winner in my book. I'm from San Diego where I grew up on Mexican food. \n\nThe facilities inside were very clean and that's always a plus.\n\nI ordered the carne asada fries and 5 rolled tacos. I would recommend both and come back to order both.\n\nI'm a fan and would come back when I need my authentic Mexican food fix.","If you haven't been to Robertos, you must live on mars!  lol  Yes, I love this place, I love there Taquitos....Thats what we use to call them back in the day, but they call them rolled tacos!  What ever!  I love them!  Robertos have stepped up there game as well, with there beans, these beans are off the chain, they have so much flavor!  \n\nOk....Sooooooo We were getting ready to order...you know how you go over to there veggie bar, and get your onions and peppers?  Ok, check this out, this family's order came up,and they had a plate of grilled green onions and peppers!  Did ya'll hear me!  I had to ask, where is that on the menu, and what is it called!  She said something in spanish, I can't tell ya'll what she said!  I did understand that she said it was free! SAY WHAT!  OMG,  I wanted that asap! I wanted to sink my teeth into that pepper in the car, but I held back until I got home!  If you love Robertos, get the grilled green onions and peppers!","Roberto's is my all time fave! My two absolute favorite menu items are: Carne Asada Nachos and the Shrimp Cocktail (spicy). This location has definitely been one of the best ones I've been to. Not only is it in a great location, but there's an awesome patio to sit at. Go check them out if you haven't yet...you won't regret it!","The carne asada breakfast burrito is an EXCELLENT way to soak up last night's beer!!","I love Roberto's and this one is right by my house, lucky for me it is one of the best ones I have been to. I tried Faustos (once), right across the street and it just does not compare to Roberto's. I am here at least once a week. Everything is good here; tamales, burritos, tacos. The refried beans are excellent, that's like the basis of judging a good mexican place, imho.","Ah Robertos. Your location is of no relevance, Eastern, Bermuda, or anywhere else for that matter I can always trust you to give me the bubble guts. I think I'll leave it at that. \n\nOh thanks for the free limes for my Coronas tho.","Didn't think that it was all that. The food was a little bland and uninspired, but that seems to be the state of Mexican food here in Vegas... Seriously, do I have to go to Del Taco to get a good chicken taco?","For the price, it's pretty solid grub. Got a carne asada chimi and chile relleno. Didn't finish either since it's soooo much food. The chile relleno was one of the better ones that I've had and it was crazy-cheap. The chimi was good, though not spectacular. It's a good go-to spot for takeaway mex food. Can't wait to go again.","Mexican food that is quick and to the point. Great for a quick lunch. Good food, but fast food atmosphere.","gotta have my carne asada fries... with pickled jalapenos n carrots n green sauce","quick service.\ni got the beef tacos.\n\nTheir rice were pretty much salt balls and the beef was super dry. so it was really salty and really dry. I threw them away after my 3rd bite. \nTaco shell was crunchy though.","A lot of good food for very low prices.","This is by far the worst Roberto's I have ever been to! The management here is absolutely atrocious ! My friends who accompany me for meal at this restaurant   are constantly harassed and bothered by the staff, I myself am Hispanic and have no personal problems with the staff yet whenever my friends are accompanying me ( who are Caucasian and asain) are treated completely different. They are mocked and rushed when ordering , they are yelled at for laughing , rushed out of the restaurant after eating, ignored at time and recently my friend had the POLICE CALLED on him by the manager for setting a food tray on the ground! Doing nothing wrong my friends waited for the police to show up and Henderson police informed them that the woman accused them of damaging property and stealing a cup for a drink ! My friend provided the recipe and no charges were made! The food here itself isn't that good , very oily if your not ordering a burrito the rest of the food is bland, dry and sub par. I am absolutely done with this restaurant and it's terrible staff and management! My friends are not the only victims of their harassment , it's extends to a majority of there customers ! DONT EAT HERE !","Friendly, cheap, consistently good, open 24hrs - really can't ask for anything more. Countless drunken nights have ended here, and its great no matter what we order. Favs are nachos (beef or chicken), chicken taquitos, carne asada quesadilla, carnitas plate, carne asada chimichanga. One negative is their horchata - not as good as some other mex places. Tastes almost watered down.\n\nI have gotten food poisoning from the one off Bermuda w the drive thru, but never this one.","roberto's was my first encounter with mexican taco shops especially with carne asada fries. and for me i stopped getting their fries because the fries get soggy quick and i dont like that it comes with tomatoes. but this last visit, i went with a couple of classmates and they recommend the 3 rolled tacos with guac and shredded cheese on top. they come in a choice of chicken and beef. i ordered 2 beef and 1 chicken. overall, 3 rolled tacos doesn't get my mexican fix. the portions are small like taquitos. and the meat was fit to the roll, so i tasted meat in a total of 2 bites and the rest was the fried roll. as for the guacamole, it tasted unfresh and the consistency was wateryy. as for service, its whats expected from robertos.","I know these guys have a strong, dedicated following.  But I've tried it a few times and I strongly feel that their food is tasteless and makes you feel endlessly bloated.  Service and atmosphere are equally mundane.  The best thing about this place is the salsa bar.  But it is often messy and depleted.","Roberto's NEVER disappoints. Always good, always fast, always open. The staff is very pleasant. I love the spicy carrots. \n\nNot gonna hear a peep out ta me. I am very curious about the mural painted on the counter...one day I will ask....one day.\nToday, I wonder if the man in the doorway holding the rather large knife is just um...going outside to chop down some cactus......not decapitate the woman walking by to meet another fella .....foods ready!","I am sorry but this place gives you way too much food and I don't like the vibe of the restaurant. The employee didn't speak English and didn't know what to say to me. I tried my best to make him understand but I totally got the wrong food. I did not care but he was annoyed I wasn't eating it. He gave me a dirty look and I was very annoyed as well. I don't think I will be going back......","It is not even close to 5 Stars, in any category. Yes, the place is very clean, compared to other Mexican restaurants but that is not something that should be given any extra praise for. EVERY PLACE SHOULD BE CLEAN ALL THE TIME.\n\nThe portion sizes at the location are just average, nothing special. Fausto's, across the street is bigger and better in most categories. \n\nRoberto's does have a reputation for some of the best Breakfast Burrito's. However, this location is just borderline average. Every visit that I have sampled one, and this is in the 15-20 range, 90% of the time, the eggs are way overcooked and the taste is very bland, no seasoning what so ever.\n\nWhen us Gringo's order French Fries, they ask if you want Ketchup, and then charge you for it. This is ridiculous and does not happen at every location. This is not ever 4-Star quality.\n\nThis location will have to make dramatic improvements to even be able to be considered with places like Pepe's, Fausto's or Carlito's.","Not sure if it was an off night but my 2 beef taco plate was subpar. The tacos were on the skinnier side than what I've had at other locations, the rice had chunks as if scraped from the bottom of the pot, and everything was super salty, more so than usual. Will try Faustos across the street next time for my Mexican food craving.","I love Roberto's! The fact that they are open 24 hours makes it my number 1 choice after a night out. The California burrito, rolled tacos and carne asana burrito are my favorites. Very fast service and such a great value! I will probably never go to chipotle or qdoba again after discovering Roberto's.","Someone told me that Roberto's is the best Mexican restaurant around here so I gave it a try.  I cannot say I agree with that opinion. It's not that the food is bad, but I wouldn't call it the best at all.  To be fair, the only outright terrible item I had there was the guacamole - it was the consistency of SOUP- horrid!!  \n\nNow, I also had a bad experience when the cashier charged me more than was stated on the menu and didn't speak enough English to resolve the problem. She had to call the manager and have me speak to her before I could get a refund. The problem was that they changed their prices in the register without updating their menu.  I was so annoyed that I swore to myself I'd never go back, but then I decided to try again. I  mean, mistakes do happen.  \n\nThis time there a woman working in the kitchen who I recognized from before.  She said to the cashier that I was the woman who cheated them last time! Hey- hablo espanol, mujer!   You better believe I watched her closely to make sure she didn't spit in my order, 'cause she sure was giving me the evil eye. I've never gone back there- too disappointed.  But don't let my little adventure stop YOU!  If you don't mind runny guacamole and don't make the people in the kitchen angry, you should be all right.  ;-)","Papas & eggs burrito with a bit of cheese and pico.  Enjoying sitting outside, hanging with family & friends, and splitting this very large burrito!","Nice place, food is good for mexican fast food.  clean.  decent service","Mmm Roberto's Carne Asada Nachos..... mmm rolls taquitos with fresh guacamole!!!! I've been to many Roberto's but since my store is in the diagonal shopping center I decided to give this one a try. My bf, friends and I went there late at night, around 11:30pm and it had a decent crowd. The food is a bit salty, but the meat is very well seasoned! I love the carrots & jalapeños they have sliced, it has the perfect amount of spiciness. The carne asad nachos & fries are perfect for a group of friends who want a full filling snack ;)\n\nThe only reason why I give this place a 4 was because the bathrooms were kinda dirty~","When I feel the need for some greasy and thick mexican food..I head straight to Roberto's!! Whichever location you choose, you can't go wrong..they all have the same taste.  I always get the #4 combo plate..2 hard shell beef tacos w/ rice and beans.  Price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give.  I really like the fact that they are open 24hrs also so after a night of clubbin, it soaks up all the alcohol! :)","The guy who was working when we went in was sooo nice and funny!  He gave me some Spanish lessons and joked with us.  The place is spacious and very clean.  Our food was awesome with huge portions. \n \nThis is the best Roberto's I've been to so far.","price- reasonable\nstaff -helpful and attentive\nportions - huge(enough for two, if you get the chimichanga plate)\nfood- too salty, as u know when you cook or add anything with cheese, it has it's own salt, no need to add more to the meats...pls kill the salt and then you can taste the goodness of the food...ty","Food, Food, & more Food!! For so little you get so much & if they like you & ur not rude they are 100% generous. it dont even matter how good ur spanish is or how good there English is. Kindness is universal.... I love the Super nachos with carne asada no beans xtra meat & chesse AHHHHHH! so DAMN GOOD!","The thing about Roberto's is that they are all different. It's not like McD's where a Big-Mac is a Big-Mac wherever you are...\n\nThis Roberto's is OK for this side of town.","Quick, Fast, Cheap Mexican Food.\nOpen 24 Hours\nOddly enough, I've NEVER gotten sick from eating here! ;-)\nThe Horchata is a MUST!","Great fast food mexican style, almost authentic - not your Taco Bell.  Have had the carne asada combo plate, dry burrito, taco combo plate and the chorizo morning burrito.  Fresh and hot cooked to order.  Inexpensive and nice condiments of cucumbers peeled, carrots, jalapenos, lemons, both green and red sauce.  For quick, fast mexican food 24 hours a day this is the place.","When it comes to quick, reasonably priced Mexican food that's open 24-hours, only Roberto's Taco shop comes to mind. There are quite a few locations all over town but this one happens to be the closest one to me. Some of my favorites include the California burrito, carne asada fries and breakfast burritos!\n\nGood times for Roberto's.... or shall I say buenos tiempos!","Hungry- need authentic?  Check this place out.\n\n1.  Portions - Nice and big for the hungry beast in you.\n\n2.  Quality - Authentic and good. I really enjoyed the Nachos with beef and the Carne Asada Burrito. Ok, these are not authentic choices, I know, but I love lengua, and taquitos and they have the real stuff. Their little salsa bar with the two salsa's, green onions and pickled veges are great!\n\n3.  Prices - A bit on the pricey side, comparing to a Del Taco or Taco Bell, but this is the real deal.\n\n4.  Service- More or less self service, but good overall.\n\n5.  Room - Plenty of room to sit, clean and relaxing."],"business_id":"uED1-WKvlb5brLfOLNH_jg","name":"Robertos Taco Shop","categories":["Fast Food","Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Burritos! I'm hooked.\n\nA trip into Los Cardos has become a regular Thursday night treat after a fitness class - it's right near my flat, so I can run in, get my chicken-with-peppers-and-guacamole burrito, and get home while it's still warm and scrummy. Mmmm. My reward card fills up fast.\nThey did laugh at me when I admitted I eat my burrito with a knife and fork mind you... but I'm a messy eater, I'd get it everywhere otherwise!","Definitely serves great burritos - mine was full of flavour & jam packed with filling - carnitas, sour cream, guacamole, salsa verde, cheese, rice & re fried beans. The only criticism is that it was a burrito of two halves... The rice & beans at one end & the carnitas & toppings at the other. Each mouthful was tasty & I was definitely full once I'd finished it. \n\nThe service was great, esp as I was part of a large group getting takeout at the same time. \n\nThe tortillas & guacamole were great for sharing. \n\nI'd definitely go back if I was in the area but it's too far away to become a regular go-to.","Alright Scotland, I'll grant you this- Los Cardos is a solid entry on the battlefield of Mexican flavor. It's not perfect, but when you can't be in The Mission it'll do!\n\nFirst, the good: the quesadillas are cheesy bombs of goodness. They're almost overly filling, and the chicken has decent flavor on its own. The sour cream and choice of salsa that come complementary are ample.\n\nHowever, even cheesy madness has its limits. By the end, cutlery is almost a requisite to handle the impending tortilla collapse. And despite its spicy billing, the \"roastin' red salsa\" is without any burn, at least for anyone with a taste for Sriracha.","I can't give this place 5 stars, sorry i can't. \n\nI opted for the soft tacos and the three different fillings (because i couldn't decide on one) - Carnitas, steak and chicken.  All fillings were very tasty.  Couldn't fault on taste at all.  And i added extras such as gucamole and sour cream and cheese.\n\nValue is 10/10\n\nOne word: MESSY.\nBecause it's takeaway, by the time you start eating it, the tacos are soggy on the bottom from the sauces.  But it the taste was yummy-awesomeness.  Just Messy.  I like my gucamole, sour cream and cheese to be through out, not just on top.  \n\nI will be back - i will opt for the less messy burrito - probably the carnita as i love the taste!  I just hope that the have the sour cream through out the burrito and not just on top. (Illegal jacks do a terrific job at this).\n\nTasty, great value and yummy!","Sorry Mexico, this is the home of the best Burritos in the world.!\n\nIt's all fresh and home made you'll be glad to hear and it's cheap as hell. Me and my girlfriend both ate for £11 and couldn't finish our portions. \n\nThe staff were kind enough to give me an extra portion of Pinto beans to take home for cooking. Very nice indeed.\n\nMy only gripe is that the seating area is always full (usually with the same people), but don't let that put you off trying this place out!","Not to repeat what others have said before but I will no doubt!\n\n4 stars - solid, good food, great flavours, plentiful portions. Food is available to eat in or take away and the tortilla chips are fab. Though if you get the burrito bowl, they are NOT required as the sour cream, meat/veggie choice, salsa, cheese, rice and black beans is all more than enough on it's on without added chips to dip into.\n\nAll of the above (with pork carnitas) was all nice and GF - happy but full tummy and I'll definitely return if I'm in the vicinity!\n\nNOTE - the burrito bowl isn't messy but the wrap style dishes are so try to avoid spilling it everywhere as the fillings are generous!","Los Cardos - Mexican munchings on Leith Walk\n\nSo, just a quick post on this one, as I wanted to get the word out about how much I enjoyed my box of food which I picked up last Tuesday night. My rather excellent personal trainer Tracy Griffen recommended   Los Cardos to me last week, but they'd just closed for the day by a whisker when I popped by , so a second attempt was made and was a success. Still open, I was gonna get me some dinner.\n\nLos Cardos opened a few of weeks ago on Leith Walk, on the block between Dalmeny Street and Jameson Place. It's a little takeaway shop, with a couple of seats for if you want to eat in. The very friendly people behind the counter talked me through the menu  - so many tempting choices, so it was a bit of a dilemma on the picking front. The had steak, chicken, pork, pinto and black-eyed beans, and all sorts of fab veggie bits, guacamole and salsa to top and dress the burritos, or tacos, whatever takes your fancy.\n\nKind of knackered from my work-out, I realised that my decision making powers were a little useless, and the only thing I could really decipher from my brain was that I was very hungry, and heck, all of it looked good. I think I muttered something along the lines of 'chef's choice' and so I took home a tasty box filled to the brim of their rice ,beans, carnitas of pork which is braised in their tangy salsa verde, some lettuce, sour cream, cheese....Anything else? Um, nope, I think that was all. Their tag-line is 'Fresh Mex', and it was definitely the best takeaway dinner I've had in a long time; really nice home-made tasting food. Only, the beauty is that they take care of stocking all of the millions of component dishes, and I just have to provide the plate and cutlery when I get back to the house. Sweet deal or what? My only gripe is that their drinks fridge (as giant and plentifully filled as it was) didn't seem to offer a huge choice beyond sweet sticky sodas, energy drinks and water. It'd be cool it if they struck up a deal with some local fresh juice company. Maybe they do their own ? Will check it out next time.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Los Cardos has already recruited a loyal legion of fans; not bad going in three weeks!  Anyway, they're waiting for their website to be finished, but in the meantime here's the link to their Facebook page, which has the current contact details. In FB-speak, Leila Likes this (giant thumbs up).\n\nps - Word is they also do MacSweens legendary haggis as a filling. Why, it's so loco it might just work!\n\n\nFrom http://leilappetit.blogspot.com/2010_04_01_archive.html","I thoroughly enjoyed my burrito today. All I can say is that the pork carnitas melted in my mouth and I got all the toppings. \n\nI can recommend my burrito which consisted of:\n\nPork carnitas\nBlack beans\nSour Cream\nPico de Gallo (with an extra scoop)\nRice\nGuacamole\nLettuce\n\nand yes, he could barley close that burrito but it was delish. Usually I can't finish these huge burritos. I literally inhaled this thing and wanted another!!! My friend had the beef and she said it was chewy, so be warned but I can wholeheartedly say the carnitas was tender, tasty and beautiful.","The best burritos in town. What else do you need to know? Great choice of fillings, condiments and homemade salsas. Very tasty, generous portions and reasonably priced. And their soft tacos are really good as well (you get three in a serving).\n\nWe've taken American guests here and they confirm that the burritos here are the real deal. The staff are nice too, so you can't go wrong. Don't waste money on \"Should Be\" Illegal Jacks (that expression copyright by Gillian L); for an authentic burrito get down to Los Cardos.\n\nThey have a couple of small tables, but it's basically a take away kind of place. I really wish they would open a proper restaurant with a more expansive menu as I'm sure they would do great versions of other Mexican classics.\n\nCheck out all the 5 star reviews. Yelp doesn't lie!","This place is uh-mazing!!!! \n\nWe came here on accident a few weeks ago when we were in Leith. We met the owner's lovely wife at a Christmas fair where she was selling delicious salsa and she told us about the actual restaurant just a few doors down. Of course our tummies were grumbling at this point and as two native Southern California transplants, we always had room for a little Mexican food! \n\nOMG this place was delicious!!  (sorry for the over excessive use of exclamation marks, but it's necessary) \n\nWe both got veggie burritos with fajitas and they were so good and tasted so much like home. They did a GREAT job with the guacamole too! \n\nWe came back yesterday with family who was in town from So Cal and they loved it too! We all fully approved of its Mexican tastiness. \n\nAlso, as if it couldn't get any better, they had veggie Haggis that you can put in your veggie burrito. I was like..umm wha? And then we tried it and it was sooo good! Best veggie haggis ever! and in a burrito - total win-win. \n\nI wish we lived closer to this place, then again, I might blow my whole bank account on it if we did! Definitely check it out ASAP!","I liked it dont get me wrong but it didnt make me go wow!\n\nI went for the carnitas burrito - slow cooked pork with a marinade, filled with salsa, sour cream, pinto beans, rice etc.\n\nThe rice to me was cold, the pork a bit dry and the marinade ok but lacked a punch. The servings are generous, the staff friendly and helpful! Just lacks a bit of seasoning and some punch for my taste.\n\nOn the upside the frsh dips etc are awesome - the gaucamole inparticular packs in lots of flavour!!","There was a lot of hype building up to our last Yelp get-together and group nom'ing at Los Cardos. I think that may be the reason why I was a little less in love with my chicken bowl than I thought I would be, but I think perhaps I also ordered the least flavourful option on the menu.\n\nThe goods. Los Cardos is a take-away (with a few seats, but mainly take-away) burrito bar that does tex-mex well, so I am told by Americans and Mexicans alike. You can order a burrito, fajitas, quesidillas or even just a 'bowl' of the filling without the wraps - nice touch.\n\nChicken, beef, carnitas, veggie. Two types of beans, rice, cheese, four types of salsa (which really are epic) and rice. Done. \n\nI got in touch in advance to let them know a large group  may be descending on them needing fed and they were really helpful and lovely. They suggested I book a space at the Victoria bar a few doors down, as they don't mind people taking in their Los Cardos food if they buy a drink. Very handy to know! So I was impressed by how friendly they were, as were the staff in the shop. Normally take away staff can be rushed and are used to acting like post-club police to drunks. These guys were cool.\n\nAs I said, I had the chicken. I could see it in the container about to be served and already felt disappoitned. Tiny cubes of what looked like very dry, processed chicken. The carnitas was pulled hot pork in a delicious sweet marinade (yes I got to try some). The chicken was dry, a bit flavourless and I actually felt a bit out-of-love with my dinner option as it was the main substance to it. Beans and beans and rice are rice. The saving grace was the salsa verde, which I was highly recommended and which WAS really good.\n\nI think I ordered the wrong thing. A carnitas burrito with extra hot salsa would have had me weak at the knees. And it does pain me a little to give this place only 3 stars, but my order really was just 'a-ok'. Not awful, I ate and enjoyed it for the most part, and do recognise it's quite a rare thing to find in the UK, Scotland let alone Edinburgh - good tex mex. Next time it's carnitas for me and next time I might be a happier bunny.","Last nights Yelp get together involved my second outing to Los Cardos.  The first was just as it opened and I wasn't blown away then, but with the great reviews as of late I was looking forward to giving it another chance.  Unfortunately it was exactly as I remembered which was simply \"OK\".\n\nI am a massive fan of Tex Mex food, burritos in particular, but the truth is I have had much better, not just in San Francisco where they originated from... but if im being honest, in Edinburgh.  \n\nThe actual place it pretty cool, its primarily a take away but with a few tables if you want to sit it and the food is made in front of you, to exactly to your specification.  I was also very happy to find out that you could take the food next door to Victoria bar as well (which is what we did).  The staff were very friendly and served us all very quick.\n\nI had a burrito, with chicken (Red Tractor Chicken to be exact, which was done is a chilicitrus marinade) which while sounds delicious, but was actually pretty dry and tasteless.  The steak and carnitas both looked more slightly more appealing so wish I had went for one of them.   I think getting the ratio of ingredients right is the key to a good burrio though and I think this was way too heavy on the rice, which was also unseasoned white rice that served simply to dilute any flavour that was there.  The saving grace here though was the Extra Spicy Salsa, which was absolutely stunning.  Had it not been for that, it probably would have been a 2* effort.\n\nIt filled a hole and was by no means bad, it was just way too bland for me to be rushing back any time soon.","Never has love been so instant!\n\nI take you back about a month, to the Yelp meet up involving a swarm of yelpers descending upon Los Cardos for burritos and beer. Unfortunately Mr. Adams had booked himself out that particular evening to meet a friend, so I decided to peruse the website and see what it was I would be missing....\n\nNeedless to say I was upset.\n\nSo upset that I couldn't wait for the inevitable 'next time' to swing round. I hopped in the car and swung by to sample this interestingly tasty-sounding menu that very night. Upon entry I was greeted by the friendly, chatty staff who were more than happy to talk me through the concept:\n\n- Choose a wrap style (burrito, enchilada, quesadilla, etc)\n- Choose a meat\n- Choose a salsa\n- The End.\n\nI opted for the Pork Quesadilla. Massive wrap bread, dealt with a generous portion of meat and even more cheese, grilled up and sliced into 3 sandwich-like servings. In a word: sold!\n\nSubsequently I loved it so much, I managed to rope the friend I was meeting into going along again the same night the yelpers went down. Even beat most of them to it! It is now my mission to work my way round the menu starting with the quesadillas (pork, chicken and haggis down....). A New Year's intention I have no doubt I shall easily achieve!\n\nClearly taking a leaf from Oink's book, Los Cardos have taken the simplistic, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin concept and raised the bar a little higher.  The shop is low on frills, high on quality; a few seats for those that have made the distance to get their burrito; a delivery service is available and I think they might even be on justeat.com. \n\nIt seems it is these simple concepts that really reap success around Edinburgh. A fact that leaves me wondering why there aren't more eateries like this...?","Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and for the purpose of this review this does not mean anything else but: I'm proud of my food and I can be very strict with anything served as / associated with/ recognised as Mexican. Next, three facts:\n\n1. Burritos can be found in their natural habitat only in the north of Mexico. And not all the north, but only some states. It's a very simple snack: a flour tortilla with a bit of beans and cheese (the most traditional one). You can also find burritos with other fillings (generally two, being one either beans or cheese). That's all, no rice, no cream, no guacamole, no salsa, etc... \n\n2. Burritos are now a very popular fast-food snack in the US, possibly more popular in the south of the US where lots of Mexican immigrants live these days. Therefore, burritos are part of what is now known as tex-mex food. I've never tried a burrito in the US so I don't know how they are served but I presume this is where burritos took their now more popular looks and taste.\n\n3. Los Cardos does not intend to serve real Mexican food or Mexican real burritos. They got the idea from the Californian tex-mex burrito and offer a healthier alternative to take-away food at a reasonable price, and using fresh ingredients and good quality products. This is what the website says (go and check if you want).\n\nSo now I think it will be fair to say that...\n\nLos Cardos' \"interpretation\" and/or \"re-construction\" of burritos is a successful one and I think the success is the result of taking some common ingredients in Mexican food (beans, rice, salsa verde, coriander, cream, etc) with others not so common (like carnitas) and still leave room for the costumer's choice. Sounds like a winning formula, right? So basically, you choose the type of tortilla, the type of meat, the fillings, the salsas. How tasty your burrito will turn out to be, well... it's up to you.\n\nWhile I was observing how my burrito was prepared (a carnitas burrito) with all the fillings I chose (cheese, cream, beans, rice, coriander, the whole lot really) the guy explained to me about the quality of products and freshness. And yes, very fresh and well prepared. So, what they say they offer is what you'll get. By the way, very friendly staff.\n\nAs a take-away you're not expecting the premises to be memorable. And as I was not planning to eat my burrito there, I didn't really pay attention to where costumers could eat. I do remember very vaguely to see a couple of tables with costumers. \n\nI paid for my burrito a bit more than 5 pounds. A massive burrito. And I know it is a reasonable price for take-away food in the UK -and even more if good quality products are taken into account, but I still think it is rather pricy. Or perhaps I can't be objective enough (I can't help comparing prices of burritos in Mexico and they don't cost much at all... it's a snack!). Let's say that compared to other take-away snacks (kebabs, for instance), Los Cardos' burritos are probably within the price range.\n\nSo... Is this place good? I think it is. Is this good for Mexicans (especially the ones from the north)? Perhaps... it all depends how orthodox / flexible you are. Will I go back? If I'm in the area, quite possibly. \n\nBeing far from Mexico, not having \"my\" food here, has had many different interesting effects: I cook more, I've discovered markets and delis where I can find Mexican products (will write a review of Lupe Pintos soon!) but I have also learnt to appreciate other foods. To me, Los Cardos' burritos, as they say on their website, are purely inspiration. And as that, I take it... Yet, I was the most grateful Mexican when I first smelt the carnitas and a very subtle hint of orange transported me to a street market full of bright colours and music. Perhaps it was just an illusion or perhaps I was just... inspired.","I have been re-inspired to yelp review by Los Cardos. \n\nSo many of the places I have been recently have been expensive or mediocre.\n(I have a really hard time figuring out how to review these places as \"everything was whatever and it cost a lot\" makes a shitty review)\n\nLos Cardos, you brought me back to shouting from the rooftops that my lost desire to eat something other than canned tuna HAS BEEN FOUND! \n\nThe burritos taste like sweet, sweet Mexican American fare. \n\nYou know what I am talking about. Los Cardos makes me feel like I am drinking a Pacifico in a tackily decorated Mexican Restaurant where they're playing telenovelas and mariachi music. Authentic American Burritos.","When dealing with fast food, you have to consider the deliciousness/shame ratio.  That is, is the pleasure gained from the deliciousness of the food completely undone by the wave of diners remorse that follows as you wallow in grease-soaked regret?\n\nA kebab, for example has a low score - as no amount of tastiness can overcome the bitter shame of that horrifying moment of post-kebab clarity.\n\nThe good news about Los Cardos is that it scores highly on deliciousness and pretty low on shame.  The food is excellent, and looks and tastes freshly made from good quality ingredients.\n\nThe staff are friendly and the service is good - the menu isn't particularly extensive but what they do they do very well, and it can be combined in enough ways to keep you occupied for a while.\n\nGive it a go.  I think it's easily the best takeaway in Leith.","Feeling tired after a long, hard day at work?  Don't have the energy to cook?  Simple - pick up the phone, order on line or pop into Los Cardos Mexican restaurant on Leith Walk.  \n\nI'm not embarrassed to say that this is my regular take away restaurant and it never fails to hit the spot.  The pork quesadillas are the best thing on the menu.  Don't be put off if you don't like pork as I don't usually go for this type of meat however it literally melts in your mouth.  What's better than pork quesadillas for dinner?  Left over pork quesadillas for breakfast as the portions are enormous!!!  \n\nSo, only one more thing to say - Un quesadilla de carnitas por favor.","I don't think I'll ever be able to eat again. It's at least 16 hours after I ate the Carnitas Fajita Burrito (with no rice) and I'm still unable to contemplate food.\n\nI didn't even plan to eat it all. For a start, they are HUGE. But half way through and it tasted too frickin' good so I kept going. We ordered four burritos for delivery, and when they arrived they weren't piping hot, and the salsa had made them a little soft and they leaked and it was messy. So I was a wee bit like \"oh that's not so good\". But then i bit into it and all that is good about pulled pork and cheese and hot salsa and onions and peppers and burrito hit my tastebuds and I kept eating and here I am 16 hours later with a food baby and wondering when I can get my next burrito fix.\n\nLast time I came here, the only other time, I didn't have a 'burrito'. I just had the filling in a box, so chicken and beans and veg but not wrap. And I wasn't that impressed. I think the proof here is in the pudding. It's tex mex. It's big, it's unhealthy but you have to just go for it. So don't do what I did the first time. Come here, throw caution to the wind, order the biggest, cheesiest thing you can find and enjoy. \n\nI would say that looking at the other burritos that had rice, I think I got the better deal as there was a LOT of rice in there and mine had none, so more carnitas. The carnitas, btw, are really pretty tasty. Better than the chicken I'd wager. \n\nSo I'm now a Los Cardos fan and the fact they deliver is even better - or not, considering I now don't even need to leave my couch to get another...","While there's not much competition in Edinburgh this is the best burrito in town! I had a steak burrito - a little light on the meat, but still a good value. I'll definitely return","Fresh, fast, tasty - and mighty popular. Deservedly so. These burritos measured up to the finest Tex-Mex available - had the veggie one this evening, with extra hot salsa and it was divine. \n\nThis is a great place to grab a bite if you're heading up or down Leith Walk, between times/shops/pubs etc. So friendly, too; the lady making my burrito even looked down at her work, smiled and commented, \"Mmmm, that looks so tasty!\". In how many other eating establishments would that happen. She was right, too - it was damn tasty.\n\nThe haggis burrito is a beast - who knew this Tex-Mex-Scots combo would work? It does, indeed it does, but don't expect to want to eat again for a couple of days. Now there's a challenge for you!","the day after a late night staying up baking an emergency sponge cake for a bake sale, means i was in no mood for cooking my own dinner when i finally returned home after work.  what it did mean though was a quick browse on justeat.co.uk and an order placed to los cardos.\ni've had take away from this place a few times before and was very excited when they added carnitas to their filling options.  what i really love is that they do burrito bowls meaning i can get the best of the burrito without having to take on the extra calories of the tortilla wrap.  (those extra calories generally go to the lovely fresh tortilla chips they have, a huge bag for only £1.40!!)\nmy burrito bowl tonight was carintas with pinto beans, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.  it was a lovely combination, especially the fresh guacamole, and the only draw back was the plain rice at the bottom of the box.  while everything else was very tasty and fresh the rice was just bland, boring white rice with no seasoning in it. \nthe fresh tortilla chips were extra good because for some reason they gave me not one, but two bags! (does anyone want to have a bag and a halfish of tortilla chips???)  they went very well with the slightly spicy salsa verde.  the whole meal was washed down well with a peach iced tea.  i love a place that sells iced tea as this seems to be a rarity in the UK!  but being american i do enjoy a nice iced tea every now and then :)\nanother excellent point was their service, they called me to check that the phone number and address was right before setting out for delivery.  very thoughtful and it meant my food was delivered quickly, much under the predicted 45 minutes that justeat.co.uk told me.\nthere are two reasons i've not given this place five stars, one is the bland rice, which would be so easy to fix, just mix in some chopped up coriander and lime juice, delish! the second is the minimum delivery order of £12 since i've generally spent less than £10 when i pick it up from the restuarant.  something else they should look into as other take aways have a minimum delivery starting at £6 which is much more reasonable.\neither way though, this definitely filled the fresh and tasty no fuss dinner that i needed tonight and now it's time to finish up the dish washing from my frantic baking!!","Yet again I find myself sorely disappointed with Mexican food in Edinburgh...\n\nI was expecting big things here after so many highly marked positive food, alas it was not meant to be. For some reason these burrito bars here forget one of the key elements in Mexican food, seasoning! I'm not talking only of \"spicy\" seasoning but something that packs a punch and makes your taste buds dance with delight. This place wasn't as bad as Illegal Jacks but still wasn't as good as Tex Mex 2 or the Glasgow joint Taco Mazaman or even Pintos. \n\nSad, I was really looking forward to establishing my burrito haven but I'm just gonna have to stick with my kitchen for now.","Fantastic new burrito place in Edinburgh - set up by some American ex-pats who actually know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like! My favourite is the haggis burrito (ok, not exactly an authentic Mexican combination but it works!) - this is no lame tex-mex place. AND it's very inexpensive. Love it.","Los Cardos is a small tex-mex themed place just down Leith Walk.  Conveniently, it is right around the corner from where I live!!!  If you like burritos this is definitely the place to go in Edinburgh (Illegal Jacks is also quite nice but I feel Los Cardos has the slight upper-hand, having had both restaurants' burrito offerings several times).  \n\nMy personal favourite is the la carnitas, which is a slow-roasted pork.  You get a generous helping of rice, beans, meat, sour cream (which is free unlike at Illegal Jacks) and a choice of three-to-four different types of salsa ranging from mild to hot.  The chicken burrito is also highly recommended. I have not tried the steak or the veggie burritos.  \n\nLos Cardos also offers tacos, fajitas and quesedillas for those who prefer something other than a burrito.  You can also get a loyalty card, which after 5 stamps gets you free nachos and salsa, and after 10 stamps gets you a free burrito (or any of the other foods they offer).  And two can dine for roughly £11!!\n\nWe usually get takeaway but you can also sit in as there are a few tables. Seating is limited though.\n\nDefinitely recommend Los Cardos for one of the best burritos in Edinburgh!!","Like most Mexican food outlets, Los Cardos can be a bit hit and miss. Fortunately they have a lot more hits than misses.This is a very handy wee place for those of us who live in Leith and crave a quesadilla or burrito on the way home from work. You can order online too, so especially nice if you fancy a break from the doldrums of Chinese & Indian takeaways. Their green salsa and carnitas are absolutely out of this world!","Black beans and salsa verde !!! O ya that's what I'm talking about! I've tried a few Mexican places in Scotland this last year and 1/2 and nothing is ever good enough to bring me back. But this place is awesome! I only had the chicken burrito so I can't  judge the rest of the menu but the people next to me had the quesadillas and they \nlooked huge and awesome! My burrito was also huge and loaded with black beans !!! I LOVE BLACK BEANS!!! Something few places have here! And best of all this place was reasonably prices! Nothing worse then bad over priced Mexican. ... This place is like a connection to home (CA) for me! So excited! Will be back again for sure!","ok, i have a confession to make.... this place is my go to takeaway when i'm tired, can't be bothered making dinner, and want something quick that is not as unhealthy as the normal takeway and is freshly made.  \n\ni've gotten my dinner here about four times since my last review (i should really get a customer loyalty card!!) and i have to say it has been solidly tasty, especially so tonight!  i got my usual, carnitas burrito bowl, tortilla chips, and a side of pico de gallo and it all seriously hit the spot....the incredibly delicious spot!!  i'm still munching on the tortilla chips as i write this update!!  the carnitas was super mosit and tasty and mixed well perfectly with the pico de gallo and the normally rather bland rice (which was not so bland tonight and i noticed when they were making my bowl that coriander had been mixed through the rice).  it was a big bowl of well seasoned fresh food that filled my tummy and put a smile on my face.\n\nwhat i really love about this place is the people that run it and make up the food.  the guy who put my dinner together was super friendly and even engaged in some banter about the absolutely freezing weather!!  i also appreciated that before the next customer was served by another staff member they checked to make sure i had everything that i needed for my order.  so lovely and polite :)\n\ni'm writing this update because i want to move this place from 4 stars to 4.5 stars but sadly can't reflect that on the rating system!  but this place definitely deserves to move closer to 5 stars...which is why i've reflected it by upping my previous rating!!  thank you los cardos for being there for me when i'm tired and just want to dive into well made tasty filling portions of tex mex food!!  you are amazing :)","It's not like this place needs anymore good reviews.. but hey!\n\nLos Cardos is definitely our Go-To place for a quick takeaway or when I'm cravin Tex-Mex. I've had just about everything on the menu and now order a staple, carnitas fajita with pico and sour cream.\n\nThe pork is just so flavourful and tender and OM NOM NOM NOM....\n\nThe food's always been good, the guys behind the counter friendly. The portion sizes have never wavered (from HUGE, unless you're a giant!), the price is easy on the wallet, and whatever you don't eat for dinner, warms up real good for lunch the next day!","I have had takeaway from here 3 times. ( You can sit in, but its really designed as a take out joint)\nThe 1st order we placed was simply bland ( not what you expect from a mexican) I\nhad the burrito and ordered the mildest one as i was unsure how hot it may/may not be.\nYou get a decent portion, but i was expecting more taste.. 2nd time we ordered it was much \nbetter, a little more spicy and much more tasty. 3rd attempt....back to being tastless. \nThe Sour cream doesnt have much taste to it, and all n all, I think its okay, but very much a hit or a miss.","Good food, fast and friendly staff. I like their loyalty card system, have made use of that for some free food over the last year. Recommend the 3 soft tacos if you want to try the different flavours on offer.","I just moved around the corner from this place and am a huge fan of Mexican food so my boyfriend and I decided to try it. Now I am a bit bias as I am from Arizona, which is filled with amazing Mexican food...so I didn't expect it to be totally true to what I expected..however, I didn't expect to be disappointed. I ordered the vegetarian tacos and my boyfriend ordered a steak burrito. We live literally 2 minutes away and by the time we unwrapped them at home, my tacos were completely soggy from the juices in the salsa and beans. I also noticed when they heated the tortillas they didn't heat it for more then a few seconds, so they were also cold.\n\nI would say the my biggest issue with my meal was that I couldn't get a hint of the delicious favors I would expect from Mexican food and the combination of the fillers were definitely too watery. Maybe it was just my one, that once, I am not sure. \n\nThey have the right idea, the food just wasn't good for me or my boyfriend.","I love Los Cardos. I first discovered it living just over the road from it, and not being one to turn down Tex-Mex, I became a fan. The portions are big, the food is tasty, and the ability to customise your meal down to a tee is a big selling point. That and the prices are really reasonable, you'll get much more for your buck than from most other takeaways. Another great thing is that the packaging is eco-friendly.\n\nPersonally I like to get the quesadillas, and dip it in Extra Hot salsa, with a little sour cream (good that they don't charge extra for this, although there is a charge for guacamole). My boyfriend's a fan of the burritos, which are huge. I've even got a jar of the Roastin' Red in my cupboard.\n\nThe food is great, but I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars.  Firstly, the Just Eat menu does not have the full menu - it's missing the tacos. I really enjoyed being able to have one chicken, one steak, one carnitas etc but no more. Secondly, the most recent quesadilla I got was cut into two very thick slices rather than three slimmer ones and as a result much more difficult to eat. And thirdly, because I moved that wee bit too far away to go and collect it and instead rely on delivery, I'm not able to use my loyalty card anymore (I did ask). When I lived over the road from it I was racking up stamps like nobody's business, but now the card is sitting in my purse unused. Boo. I appreciate it's difficult to verify how many stamps someone has before you order (do you bring free tortilla chips with you just in case they're about to receive stamp five?) but I feel a little like my previous loyalty is wasted. And I want my free tortilla chips!","Finding a decent burrito is not that easy in the UK. But thankfully, Los Cardos exists! Great burrito (very big) and tasty nachos. I always get the same thing and it's worth it.\n\nThe place is small, but most people take it to go so finding seating is not an issue. It is kept clean. The staff is very friendly and always up for a chat. The food tastes fresh and you can watch them put together your burrito. I've never been adventurous enough to try the Haggis burrito but I've heard good things. Taste-wise, they know what they're doing so I'm sure any combination is good.","Los Cardos, home of the famous haggis burrito, was a place I'd been meaning to visit for quite a while, so I was glad to finally make it along. The much vaunted item didn't disappoint. My only criticism would be that the filling wasn't particularly evenly spread, so it was a dish of stages, rather than each mouthful being well-balanced.\n\nOverall, we said: \"The bottom line is that I thought the Los Cardos burrito was mighty tasty. It didn't rock my world to its very core, but I would happily return and I'd happily eat it again. I really enjoyed sitting in, too, as the simple seating area is lovely, with bright walls and elegant cornicing. I'd definitely recommend a visit. Their quality is good, and the welcome extremely friendly.\"","This is perhaps a variation of Tex-Mex, but not really Mexican.  Tacos with flour tortillas only?  Or did I miss the corn variant?  And why was the pulled pork stew (carnitas) so very sweet?  No fresh cilantro on the tacos?\nSorry that I don't share the enthusiasm here -- but this is the type of Mexican food they serve for gringos in the US.  And even for this clientele Los Cardos would be sub-par.","We're recent converts to Los Cardos, and now in danger of going every night! Top quality burritos - the haggis one is surprisingly delicious. The guacamole is to die for (though I would save that for the chicken, as mixing that with haggis is too much even for us). Thoroughly recommended for a slightly healthier fast good option!"],"business_id":"v39PftbqLswMFsaQg5C9_w","name":"Los Cardos","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["This restaurant is very nice on the inside but the Mexican food is definitely not the best I've had.  I don't think I would call this place bad, but there is nothing special or desirable about it.  I would avoid weekends because it gets busy and the food is not as good.","well, we went there at 10pm on a friday and the place was starkly empty.\n\nsome burley men were creating a dance floor by clearing the place of its furniture. so we expected a party of reveling dancers to come in (there were like 2 latino men at the bar, so we thought it was like an underground durangeno dance hall on friday nights. incorrect.)\n\nanyway, 1.5 hours later, no one had come in and the burley men replaced all the furniture. no dance party at all! sad news!\n\nanyway, we just drank a lot at the empty bar at the side of the restaurant. who can really complain.\n\nas usual, it was nearly free to drink alcohol. i had two literal tankers of red bull and vodka for like 3 dollars each.\n\nit seemed like the bartenders didnt want us to be there and kind of ignored us but i guess that made it harder to black out, which is a good thing for everyone.","I've been to Frida's about 5-6 times in the past three years and it seems every trip I enjoy it less and less. It's not because of the service. There was only one time where we received lackluster service...and the place was nearly dead. The host seated my husband and I, and then we sat for 15-20 minutes, watching another couple be seated and have their drink order taken by an attentive server. We try not to be dicks. We're reasonable people. So we kept amused by betting each other if our server was smoking out back or shooting heroin out back. The host finally came by to take our drink order, and then a sheepish & stoned looking waif of a server wandered over to take our dinner order. Your guess is as good as mine whatever he was doing \"out back\".\n\nIf the margaritas weren't so strong, I'd be giving this 1 star. I used to live a ten minute drive from the Mexican border, so I understand the logic of lowering expectations so far north of the border. But I think they could try just a little harder. I like their complimentary chips & salsa, but Frida's guac tastes like it's pre-packaged. The food is ok as long as it's hot, but the flavors aren't memorable. The last time I ate here, I sat in a broken booth with springs poking my rear, which caused me to slouch over toward the wall with the huge mural on it. From this viewing advantage, I was able to notice that this place hasn't been dusted or thoroughly cleaned in ages. There are large cobwebs and a thick layer of fuzzy grime coating the fake plants and the side wall where the broken booths rest against. The mural of Frida has reflective drips where some clearish liquid spattered her face and was never wiped off. Being an artist, it is sad to see Frida Kahlo's face disrespected that way. And if the dining area is this neglected, I'm not too hopeful about the cleanliness of the kitchen. I'd like to add that I'm not one of those people who carries hand sanitizer everywhere or bleaches her kitchen and bathroom, so for me to say something's icky may put it in perspective. Maybe I didn't notice how dirty it was in the past because I was too busy sucking down their yummy margaritas.\n\nHere's the kicker: On my last visit, I was finishing the last of my margarita at the end of our meal when I saw a small roach scurry across the table. It practically fell into my lap, and brought back unpleasant memories of my infested apartment in college. I didn't do the \"girl thing\" and scream or jump out of the booth, but I might be done eating food here. However, I remain open-minded to having margaritas out on the sidewalk when the weather's nice. We'll see.","This place is getting a lot of crappy reviews, but I've never had a bad experience here. Yes, I've occasionally had some interesting waitstaff experiences (nothing drastic), but the food is good, the drinks are good, and the decor is really cool. Per some of the other reviews, they might need to get more organized there (if you're not getting waited on, ask someone to help you!), but in my expericence, it's not bad. Not the absolute best Mexican food I've ever had, but I've had some really good meals here.","the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else.","I went in, was seated and told, \"A nice young lady will be with you in a minute.\" I sat, closed my menu, stared out the window, read from my book, sent some texts. I then watched a couple next to me get seated, and receive drinks and menus. \nI got up and walked out.","I used to work downtown and went to Frida for lunch all the time. I thought it was great!  Note the past tense. My friends and I (including 2 toddlers and a baby) arrived around noon for lunch. We sat on the patio outside and had the place to ourselves. Our server wasn't very friendly. I asked her where the tostadas were on the menu and she said the menu was new. I was really sad ( I LOVED THEM!) but ordered enchiladas and a taco for my son.  I also ordered guacamole and was very disappointed. It's creamy texture makes me think it wasn't homemade which I find to be unacceptable at a Mexican restaurant. The waitress never refilled our chips. The salsa was watered down (I don't remember it being that bad). I asked for sour cream for my enchiladas which never came. The waitress came back to ask if I had received it and I said no. She asked if I still wanted it and I said yes. I needed something to wash down the dry enchilada. I am not sure if she charged me or not. I was also surprised by the prices--a root beer was $4 and I was charged extra for ground beef in my enchiladas! I ordered a steak taco for my son and the meat looked inedible.\n\nI must disclose the fact that we weren't the quietest customers. Dining with 2 toddlers is tricky so I got my son a bag of popcorn and he proceeded to pour a lot on the ground (I am very sorry for this). Later, the patio started to get really crowded and my son and my friend's son were getting loud so we asked for our check.  I took my son away so he wouldn't disrupt anyone else and waited for my friends to join me. About 15 minutes my friends came to find me saying they had to look for the waitress to run her credit card. You would think she would want such loud customers to leave as soon as possible!","The sangria is pretty good, and is more reasonable by the pitcher than by the glass.  There's also a happy hour special of 1/2 price apps, so that's Ok too. \n\n I've been to Frida a few times over the last few years, always at someone else's suggestion but would not go out of my way to eat there.  The service is OK, and appears to have improved since my last visit. \n\nFood value is fair, so while I'm not in love with the place, I don't leave feeling completely ripped off either.","Possibly the worst service I've ever had in Madison.  A hostess once tried to take away the table we'd just been seated at because some friend of hers wandered by and wanted to be seated immediately.  I've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff.\n\nThe food is nothing special--not BAD, but definitely overpriced.  The half-price margaritas, the only reason I ever go there, are pretty good, but they recently instituted a requirement that you purchase like $10 worth of their overpriced food in order to get a table rather than being confined to the bar.  Not worth it.","Grade: C-\n\nIs there such a thing as really good Mexican food? I guess if you like paying a lot for crappy Mexican food, then this is the place for you.","I was a bit dubious of this choice when I saw it but what the hell, outdoor patio, right? This was arguably the worst Mexican food that I've ever tasted. My enchiladas were lousy (I felt like the sauce was made with tomato paste) and even the high end margaritas tasted like a sweet mix. The waitstaff also seemed to be a bit out of it. \n\nI think the lesson learned is don't eat Mexican in Madison, WI.","Sad Frida's closed, but you can get the same \"Frida's\" margaritas across the street at Moe's. That's really the only reason my friends and I went here.","Average place for a campus restaurant.  We just had maragaritas and chips and guac/salsa.  The margaritas were tasty, not the best, but tasty.  The salsa tasted like pizza sauce with tabasco and the guac was pretty boring.  But drinks outside on State St. made it worth it.","Frida's is over priced, under inspired \"Mexican\" food.  The cuisine is neither authentic or unique. (or even tasty)  While I love salsa night as much as the next girl, I really would never go here to eat again. (Not when Casa de Lara is within walking distance, and El Pastor is within driving distance.  Seriously no matter what interpretation of Mexican food you prefer you can always do better than Frida's.) \n\nAs for those seeking employment, I urge you to avoid this place. (I've never worked here, but I've had close friends who have. Check out Shawn S.'s review for a brief illustration of what I mean.)","Spent a while walking around trying to decide where to eat, and ended up stopping here.\n\nThe food was fine.  I liked my dish, but it wasn;t spectacular.\n\nThe service was really terrible.  We were sitting outside and saw our waitress three times.  When the order was taken and when the food was ready and when she brought the check.  There was no asking if we wanted more booze (even though she had already upsold us on the original margarita), and getting her attention when she was walking by to service the other table was impossible.  After she left the check we waited about 20 minutes for her to come and run the card, but that never happened.  Had to ask the hostess to take care of it.  She gave it to the server who, annoyed, returned it with a simple \"there you go\".\n\nHopefully she was just having a bad night but that wasn't the impression that I got.","Came here for a late Sunday lunch and paid under $20 for two people.  Their lunch menu is great - almost every dish was $6.99!  Good chips.  Salsa was ok.  The Mole Poblano Enchiladas were very good (not a lot of places know how to make a good mole sauce which is a rich, dark chocolate colored sauce and is made with onion, garlic, a variety of chiles and a little bit of chocolate - savory and delicious! ).  I wasn't too crazy about their black beans (and I normally love black beans)  it tasted a little off.  Although I did like their refried (pinto) beans.  Overall, it was great place to grab an inexpensive and satisfying lunch.","I was wandering around downtown Madison today and ended up here for lunch.  Typical Mexican food outside of LA .... sorry I have been come biased since I have moved to LA years ago.  It gets a star for a lunch menu with most items $6.99.  The food was better than expected for that price.  I was disappointed with the sangria, but I think that might be I am a wine snob and don't like drinks made out of wine - so no deduction for that.","I'm not entirely sure what all this \"bad service\" nonsense is about.  I've generally been pleased with the servers here.  I've also found that the food is served fast and fresh.\n\nRegarding the quality of that food: questionable.  The food is hardcore mediocre mexican.  It's nothing to write home about, but it's fast, hot and tastes fresh.  Just not that great.\n\nThe margaritas were really the reason that I dragged my ex to this place so much.  The margaritas were pretty decent and came in many different flavors.  Plus, they come in insane novelty sizes.\n\nIf you want good Mexican food, I suggest you try Casa De Lara, down the street.  This place is mostly for the drinking and the nightlife.","My first question to Frida's owner regarding the women's bathroom is this: You seriously think it's okay to allow customers to go in there? Knowing he'll say, yeah, sure, why not, my second question to Frida's owner is this: Are you f-ing insane? Do you see things most people don't, like cleanliness when there's only stained toilet seats and pseudo stalls? Do you see quality when others see terror? Do you see dead people with spray cleaner and mops? You must, because seriously, your bathrooms are like my first apartment: super ugly and super scary. The place is so dark, Sherlock Holmes couldn't find the toilet paper with a treasure map and Blackbeard holding a torch to light the way.\n\nI also want to know why their rice and beans tastes like water. The rice isn't an M&M, yet it melts in your mouth. Not a good quality for a grain. The beans may or may not be legumes.\n\nWhy You Should Be Embarrassed to Own this Place: I make better rice and beans than you, and I'm f-ing Native American. Get a handle on your menu and your louvre, and I'll consider going back.","I should have known better than to try Mexican food in madison, I live in CO and the bar is pretty high. I had steak fajitas. The steak was sliced into 6\" strips and the flour tortillas were only 5\", so there was always meat hanging out of the fajita and inevitably you were not able to bite through the meat so ended up with pulling a strip of steak out for each bite.\nThe tortillas...dry and nasty\nLearn my lesson.  You are in Wisconsin, not the Southwest, avoid the Mexican food and go eat something the locals know something about.","Mediocre food with not so great staff.  Dined here with a pre-ordered party of 20.  Food was ready for us--laid out on a table next to our party and getting COLD.  One not very articulate server made for even more difficulties--it's not as if his job was really hard, the order was already made he just had to hand it out courteously.  I was here once before on salsa night-wasn't too impressed either.","To say I was disappointed with Frida would be an understatement. \n\nWe went here to that we could hear Jazz in the Square while enjoying some sangria.  The sangria mostly just tasted like watered down franzia.  There was no fruit or anything in it at all.  \n\nAfter getting our pitcher of \"sangria,\" we thought we should order something even though we weren't hungry just because we were taking the waitresses table for an unknown period of time.  We ordered some type of cheese appetizer that was so bland I can't remember anything about it besides that it was gross. \n\nThe service was quite friendly and they weren't pushy trying to get us to leave so that is the only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1.","I actually really liked Frida, I'm glad I went there in disregard to the lukewarm to awful reviews on here. The service was really nice and helpful, not over attentive but definitely at hand when needed. I ordered the Spinach Enchiladas, which were a bit bland for me - the addition of my side order of diabla sauce was a good choice. The desserts are seriously delicious, we had the chocolate cake and the flan split between 3 people and had a bit of trouble finishing them after our ample entrees. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, complete with colored lights overhead and lots of Frida Kahlo paintings. From my drinking age companions, the signature margarita was good and they knew how to make a truly dry gin martini well. I didn't find the place uncleanly and the food was delicious with a lot of items you don't always see along with the good classic staples you would expect to find.","Food=Bad. Service=Ok. \n\nUgh. If given 20 minutes in the kitchen I could concoct tastier chicken tacos from old tires and sweaty socks. Even the tortilla chips were bland. Hands down worst \"Mexican\" food ever. \n\nThe single redeeming thing about the restaurant was the nice outdoor seating; the sun was nice.\n\nI ate one of 3 chicken tacos and resorted to filling myself with the mediocre nachos and salsa. The re-fried beans were bland and the rice lifeless (I think it was Uncle Ben's). \n\nI left my with my tacos in a to-go box. As I made my way down State Street a guy on a bench asked if I could spare my left overs. I offered them over with the explanation of how bad the food was. He didn't seem to mind. \n\nBottom line=Save your money. Go to Taco Bell.","The food at Frida's is LAME. Not so bad in the sense that you'll want to vomit, but certainly bad enough that you won't even think twice about throwing away your leftovers instead of taking them home. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it really is some of the most mediocre Mexican food I've ever had, and that you honestly can get more flavorful Latin cuisine at Taco Bell. \n\nTo start, the meat is dry and totally free of any significant spices or marinade, leaving you with a stringy and uninspired base for the dish. The tortillas are tough to bite through, even when soaked in the flavorless liquids that adorn your plate. The beans taste like they came straight from a can bought at the dollar store, and the vegetables aren't all that fresh. And because every dish they make is incredibly tasteless, Frida's will load up on obscene amounts of cheese to compensate. The cheese is equally as hopeless, tasting like nothing but chewy grease. \n\nFrida's only redeeming quality is the atmosphere - a large, well-decorated 2-story loft - unless you're not a fan of looking at a giant picture of woman with a unibrow while you eat, I suppose. All in all, dining here is a horrendous, underwhelming experience. Don't waste your money. Casa de Lara is 2 blocks away.","Frida's is mediocre, at best.\n\nThe tacos are generally dry as the desert and the beans are like eating sand; and I've had their steak tacos twice (I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a fluke--not the case.) Their cheese quesadillas are just as lifeless and lacking in flavor.\n\nI've never had bad service here, but I can safely say that there's only two reasons to come to Frida's:  one, their margaritas are excellent--especially if you're stupid like me and don't mind trying to down a 28 oz. one (they have larger ones as well) in about an hour and a half time frame or more. Two, their desserts. The Tres Leches is to die for: it is rich and decadent with sweetness that makes you sit back in your chair and get a food coma.\n\nIf there is one reason I will return to Frida's, it's for the margarita and Tres Leches.","Pretty bad food but a nice ambiance sitting outside. Standard chips and salsa to start: chips overly greasy, salsa with no \"kick\" (and very little flavor besides pureed tomatoes.) We both ordered tacos: fish, and chicken. Chicken tacos come in corn tortillas: a little healthier was my goal but no: the tortillas were brushed in oil before being used to form my tacos so picking them up was more of a greasy mess. Also absolutely loaded with cheese and very little meat. My wife had the fish version. Deep fried tilapia in flour tortillas. Decent tasting, but again, very greasy. Standard sides of refried beans and rice came with both. \n\nA nice day drove us to this place; a margarita outside sounded appealing, unfortunately we should have stuck with the drinks and no lunch.","Went for dinner passing thru town in January. Had the salmon. Was quite good. Went again in June. The salmon was WAY, I mean WAY overcooked. It was so overcooked it was tuff. I told the waitress the person who prepared it was a complete novice. She offered to have it redone. I said OK, and to tell them to actually put some \"blackened\" spices on it! Although on the second round it was cooked properly, the food prep person just added (obvious) salt to the salmon, instead of actually putting a reasonable portion of \"blackened\" spices on it. Although it is a pleasant, interesting restaurant in terms of ambience, the owner is apparently too cheap to hire (or train) competent food prep staff.","Simply poor service. Went there for a drink, the place was pretty busy, so I sat at the bar. Ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips. We waited probably 10 minutes for the beers, chips never showed. I tried to pay one of the bartenders for the beer but he said he couldn't run the register. We had to wait another 10 minutes or so for the other bartender to pay for the drinks and left. Bad form, guys.","Holy crap was this place awful.  I had read all the horrible reviews and thought to my self, this place can't be that bad can it?  I walked by and saw this colorful little spot and thought I'd check it out but then I realized it was THE Frida.  What a mistake I made, I've had better texmex at Taco Bell and it still gave me the runs.  The food was positively bland and but I'll admit that the waitress was very nice and helpful.  I can't understand why there were so many people eating there the day I went.  Well I guess they were actually all drinking tons of margaritas so at that point is doesnt matter what kind of food you are cutting the alcohol with. Also the fake Frida murals were hella cheesy.  Texmex cheesy.","The margaritas are good and priced right if you go during happy hour. The food, however, is awful. Nothing here is remotely authentic and, compared to the great places like Los Gemelos, Tacqueria Guadalajara and Francisco's Cantina, this place has nothing on any of them.\n\nFrida's can be summed up with two words: overpriced and mediocre.","VOMIT ... I give it two stars because it had food, and I thin I got drunk ... The salsa was horrible.. WTF was it .. it was tomato sauce and some tabasco mixed together I swear, the service had sucked, I don't know how they stay in business... I went on a bad date their.. so I ended up drinking I think that was the only thing good about the place","The food here has always been mediocre, but the service has taken a serious nosedive.  Two friends and I stopped in to enjoy 1/2 priced margaritas, and were told we had to order $5 of food per person.  After choosing from the very uninspired list of appetizers, my friend was given a clear plastic cup to sip her margarita from.  Like a Solo cup!  When asked if she could have a big girl cup like the rest of us, the waiter informed us that Frida is \"switching to plastic\".  How environmentally informed of them.  Did I mention we weren't given any chips and salsa?  The atmospheric highlights included the flies swarming around our food, and the frat boys in their JC Penney ties shouting and gesticulating from the loft.  This place is also horrible at dealing with groups.  I went for a friend's bday, and they wouldn't split the check from 20 people to groups of five or even ten.  Half-priced margs or not, I will not be returning to Frida.","i grew up in madison but  went to school in ny and now live in chicago.  most summers, however, i lived on the uw campus.  now i frequently visit as my friends/family still live in the area.\n\none summer when i lived on langdon my friend got a job here.  she needed a job badly, and had worked in food service at various madison area restaurants for years.  she quit after a mere 4 hours.  she said the management was extremely rude and made some remarks.  the only adjectives she would use were \"gross and sexist.\"\n\nalso, she said they take expensive tequilla bottles and pour in GENERIC BRAND CHEAP SHIT.  talk about a scam.\n\navoid at all costs.","The food is not good. I've been to Frida a few times since it opened, and I've never been happy with the food. The margaritas are pretty good, but definitely not great. If you can lobby your friends to go to a different restaurant, I would.","The hostess/waitress was stained with food from head to toe.  The food was not appealing looking and the taste was comparable to the fast food chains.  The aftereffect is what pushed me to write this review as I am now very sick.","There's a large, beautiful painting on the inside of Frida's if you sit to the left of the hostess station.  Only, the painting is too big for the wall and it was hung sideways.  This is a good metaphor for Frida's.\n\nThe food is so-so.  The carnitas quesedilla is typically smothered in cheddar cheese and grease, so it's tasty.  But there's no spice and it's soggy.  The chips and salsa are average, unless you ask for the hot salsa which is actually hot.  The service is below average, even if you go when it's not busy.  Even though I go there probably twice a month because it's close to work, I've never had the same server twice which leads me to believe the turnover is high, even for a restaurant.  \n\nFrida's has potential.  The inside is beautiful, the menu has enough variety.  But everything is a little sideways.","Food and drinks are okay, but this place is very, very unclean.  If you go, don't look at the floors, the walls, the bathrooms, the air vents... Perhaps the evening events bring in enough money that they don't have to worry about the times of day when people can actually see the filth.","Is the food good? No. Is the service good? Actually, yes. On Monday night my 3 friends and I had several margaritas (because they're 1/2 off!!) and dinner there. The bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong, and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us. The place was not that happening on this particular night  - I think it's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry. We stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills, and they didn't seem to care. \n\nHas the food been authentic or anything close to that, the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate, but over all, not too much to complain about.","The food is fantastic and I love the layout of the large space Frida inhabits. Watched most of the World Cup games there this summer, and was pleased enough with the quality and speed of the bar service I recommended the place to fellow World Cup spectators, which increased my posse threefold by the finals. When we showed up for the France/Italy championship match, we were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess who was instantly interrupted by a man who reminded her loudly that all customers that day were required to order food. Between the time we walked in the door and our butts hit the barstools we heard this same man make the very same announcement to different staff members at least four times.\nNow, there are several problems I have with this: 1) you set up a temporary yet strict policy and want it enforced, you train your employees beforehand --not belligerently, and certainly not in front of customers. 2) Our group would have ended up spending twice as much money than we did if we hadn't been required to order food, since most of us had eaten already and were too full afterward to order the original barrage of margaritas we had hoped for. 3) The restaurant clearly wasn't prepared for the large task of making food for EVERYONE in there, as the service was excruciatingly slow, wrong meals were delivered, and the sound of falling trays and dishes was only barely punctuated by the bossman shouting insults to his staff. The experience was horrible. And the owner was the person responsible! Amazing.\nGo there for the food, go there for the friendly service and tip your servers well. But I personally avoid the place like the plague if the bossman is around.","My friends were roped into having their rehearsal dinner at Frida's when their original venue closed unexpectedly. It was unfortunate. \n\nWe pre-ordered, but it took an hour and a half from the time we arrived to the time we got our inauthentic Mexican food. I got the carne asada, and the steak was tough and overcooked. The refried beans had that been-sitting-under-a-lamp crust to them. One of the servers started yelling out the names of the plates across the whole room, even though we had little stickers marking what we ordered. It was a hot mess.\n\nDinner was still fun (of course---it was a pre-hitchin' dinner!), but the margaritas and the sangria were the only high points for which Frida's can actually claim credit. Still, I'd never come here again.","Within a stones throw of the beautiful WI capitol building this place is where I had my first margarita ever.  I really hope there is more to them than salt and tequila taste....\n\nThe food was average mexican fare, drinks were ok, staff was really cool and the pictures of Frida Kahlo made me go into the bathroom every 5 minutes to make sure I didn't have a uni brow also...\n\nIf you are in town and want to pick up some college girls go here because unless it was some anomaly it seemed like every table was filled with young ladies.  And either I am getting really old or young girls are looking much younger than when I was that age.\n\nNice place, I'd go again.","My favorite Madison mexican restaurant.  The decor is vibrant and traditional and the food is very authentic and colorful with lots of fresh veggies.  Great chips and salsa.  All-in-all, a nice fresh take on a cuisine that can get very predictable.  A little more expensive than say, Casa de Lara, but I always look forward to eating here. 5 stars.","I initially went because they served under-agers, the margaritas were good.  The food was decent nothing outstanding.\n\nThe reason it is given a bad rating though is because of its reputation of the management towards the employees.  The first time I heard it I thought someone was bitter at the management.  Within my 5 years at Frida's I heard many times at how the owner didn't treat his waitresses with respect or dignity.  This is why I don't go to this place or recommend it."],"business_id":"vOCmoA6cvhlA5bcATzUR0g","name":"Frida","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Riva's has great food, large quantities for low, low prices.  They're open 24 hours a day w/a drive through...I eat here at least once a week!","I give Riva's 4 stars because of the secret top burrito in town which is the California burrito and have them put a chilli relleno in the burrito which is the best of all worlds.  So basically this burrito consists of carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo, cheese and a chilli relleno all wrapped up in a delicious tortilla.  Once you add some hot sauce to that it equals one of the best burritos in town.  I learned of this only because of one of the employees telling me to get it this way because all the people that work there eat it this way.  You have to try it!","Had dinner here one weekend and had the Combo with a couple of rolled tacos, taco and toastada... crazy awesome Tacos, but the rolled tacos weren't the greatest. I loved the salsa with tons of cilantro! I need to try the menudo sometime soon!! \n\nNice, COOL, clean taquieria with a nice seating area. No cheap o booths! lovez it. and it's open 24 hours!! So if you're in the hood and its late... waaaay late... forget the bell and head to Rivas!!","Rivas is a staple for 24 hour mexican in Tempe. I would consider them a step above Filibertos but one step below Los Favoritos. I usually opt for a carne asade burrito, and the only reason I didn't give them five stars is that their burritos are not always consistent. The restaurant itself is clean and they have a nice salsa bar. Not much else to say except try them out!","The food is good but check your order before leaving. They always forget something or make it wrong. When it comes to burritos, your pretty much gonna get mystery meat no matter what you order. If you order steak and egg burrito you'll get bacon ham onions cheese and egg. Wtf? The drive thru speaker needs to be replaced and the cooks need to make what's ordered. Also the order needs to be complete. This isn't Mexico.","In pursuit of the Mexican guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/raw onion burrito, I just was not satisfied with what I received.\n\nSunday afternoon, around 2 PM.  I had taken a stroll to Fry's to get the current beer of preference (Anyone know where I can find Cave Creek Chili Beer?) and on the walk home, I went past Riva's.  The location strikes me as being a drive-through banking location at some time, tho since closed and relocated.  Windows, floors, walls are clean; even the parking lot is clean.  \n\nAs the TVs played novelas, I looked at the great variety of offerings, each with a picture in pretty vivid color, along with the name and price.  On approaching the counter, I asked if I could order a custom burrito.  The lady behind the counter asked what kind of burrito I wanted.  I explained the guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/onion burrito.  She asked if I wanted egg on it, and I replied I did not.  She walked the slip to the cook and described the burrito.    \n\nWhen the lady behind the counter received my wrapped burrito, she put it in a bag with napkins.  I asked about salsa, and she gestured toward the salsa bar.  Since the aluminum roof was down and there was no sign, I had no idea there was a salsa bar.  I packed one container of each salsa, 1 green and 2 red, along with some carrots and jalapenos.  I must express my kudos to the green sauce, a truly fabulous presentation with enough heat to be 'bout right.  No such luck with the red sauce, which seems to derive most of it's heat from black pepper.\n\nArriving at home, I put the beer in the refrigerator and unwrapped the burrito.  The heft of the burrito gave me pause.  It weighed just over 1/2 lb out of the wrapper.  I was surprised to see nothing had dripped out of the burrito onto the wrapping.  As this was a Hit and Run first try, I did not go into the Preparing for the 'new restaurant first try' experience.  \n\nFirst bite, I got the slack end of the burrito, so lots of extra tortilla.  Second bite, I was rewarded with meat and onion.  Third bite, I detected cheese and sour cream along with meat and onion, and at the fourth bite, I got evidence of American guacamole.  While I am not sure what size tortilla was used to create this burrito, there was certainly a lot of tortilla folded up.  \n\nI must take the time to inquire next opportunity I get to find out where they get their \"bacon\".  It is certainly the most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.  \n\nFor the price, $6.80 plus tax, the burrito was below what I would anticipate.  Guess I need to search out BajaMex or TexMex to find what I am looking for...","I had a terrible experience at this place.  I went through the drive-thru after a long day of moving.  I think it was about 1am when I ordered.  I ordered two crunchy ground beef tacos and a grilled chicken quesadilla.  The beef in the tacos were burnt and it was the worst taco I have ever eaten.  A complete waste of money.  The quesadilla wasn't much better.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone.  The ingredients weren't fresh and the food wasn't cooked properly.","For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant, this place is as good as it gets. There's nothing like a 3 am burrito or huevos rancheros after a long bike ride down mill. The night time crowd will probably consist of late night weirdos (I myself could be included) and the obnoxious children let out of yucca tap room. It also helps that it's basically across the street from where I often reside.I usually get a burrito with random veggie ingredients or a breakfast burrito and a horchata. There's HUGE portions, cheap prices, and their salsa is tasty too. I believe it's usually cooked to order and they are happy to deal with my picky, custom order. This definitely is gluttonous though so don't expect to feel sexy after eating.","So there is an argument about this particular establishment at my job. \n\nOne Camp states if you need to be um more....regular....go here.\nThe other camp loves this place.\n\nI watched this argument for about a year before I decided to try Riva's.\nI was glad I did. The portions are very large and tasty. \n\nI had the chorizo breakfast burrito with cheese and potatoes. I was extremely pleased to see that the burrito didn't eat its way out of the paper bag via grease. \n\nI have joined the love it camp here at work and for a quick bite I think you will too!","I was hella skeptical that a Phoenix fast food Mexican joint could top a Mission taqueria.  Rivas pleasantly surprised me.  I chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans.  Standard, but fulfilling rice and refried beans.  The burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies.  A warm tortilla filled with chicken, peppers and onions.  So simple and yet so mouth watering.  Best part was that the burrito was so big that I got to save the second one for my flight back to SF.  Oh, and this whole package was under $7.","Okay 5 stars because they are the alternative to Filibertos style food, without the Filibertos taste.\n\nIts pretty clean and they have a nice salsa bar.  Menu is a little cluttered but they have many combos and different types of items.  If you are lost, order a carne asada burrito.  if u dun like guacamole, order a green chili burrito (pork with green sauce)  real good.\n\nwhat else do i like about this place, price wise, its very comparable to most fast food and mexican fast food places.  U order at the front, pay and get your own food and drinks and bus the trays after.  \n\nits also 24 hours, so whats not to like ?","Just moved to the neighborhood and my dad said I should go here. We are pretty Mexican and know what good traditional Mexican food should taste like and this was excellent. I had the Fish taco plate, which was crispy fish, excellent sauce and fresh lettuce and pico (so good, I inhaled!). The BF had Rolled Taco Supreme, which had high quality carne asada, rolled beef tacos, guac & cheese. We also had Tamarindo and chips. The salsa bar was soo good and very authentic. I felt like I was back at my Nana's kitchen. This place is like a block away from where we live and we will definitely be going back. PS we were sober and it was like 6ish at night. I'm never eating at the Taco Bell down the street again!","I found my favorite fast-food taqueria since arriving in the Valley.  It's Rivas Mexican Food.  Talk about an AWESOME-tasting enchilada plate.\n\nThey've got a menu similar to whateveri-berto's, but with a fresher, more kickin' flavor.  Kind of like if your Nana ran a drive-thru.  If you eat in, sometimes the TV is a little loud, but once you start eating, you won't care.\n\nGo.  You will like it.  Nuff said.","To clarify I'm not the Justin V below, whom sucks.  I'm the one who posted the picture which rocks.  That being said what I'm here to talk about is Rivas and the amazing quality and flavor I've grown accustom to upon each and every visit.  Regardless of me being high or drunk when eating within the superb culinary landscape that is Rivas,  the food is spectacular.  I would say even sometimes better when I'm intoxicated (due to high endorphin rushes) or partaking in recreational drugs of which the after effects could increase pleasure.  Either way Rivas is A-OK #1, don't listen to these haters whom believe they can build credibility by changing their names to legit people like myself, mazel tov","Most of the reviewers must have been high or drunk when they gave this place such high praise.  Went here with a friend for lunch today.  First off, there was no ac.  No ac in the middle of the summer?  Hopefully it was just broken.  The food was very subpar compared to any bertos out there.  My friend got a regular beef enchilada and it was stuffed with onions and green peppers.  Wtf?  I ordered the California burrito and it was very bland and not very tasty.  I had to dump salsa on every bite to liven it up a bit.  Finally when we left, my friend had filled up her drink and accidentally left it near the soda dispenser.  She walked me to my car and remembered, so she went back in.  They had already thrown it away and refused to give her another cup.  I will never come back to this dump again.  If you're looking for an amazing taco shop at 3:30 in the morning, head to Taco Migo near the intersection of I-10 and baseline.  I've never been disappointed with the food or service there.","30 minute wait in a drive thru lane is completely redicolus. There were only 2 cars ahead of us! Way to many taco shops in town to even give this place a 2nd chance","Riva's is the flip side of Mexican fast food. Meaning Philiberto's can go suck it!\n\nThey seem exactly like any other Mexican fast food joint. To the untrained eye there is no difference...then you get your food and taste the salsa. \n\nWOW! Someone knows what they are doing. This place consistently kicks out quality food that satisfies. I have always been very happy at the end of the meal, and later on as well!\n\nDrive through as well!","Ate here in the early afternoon. Boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, I got a shredded beef burrito. His was dripping some weird watery greasy crap..mine made me sick instantly after. Unless I'm eating bean and cheese burritos from here late at night..I'll pass. Why not just go to Amado's or Filly B's?","I have never been able to complain about anything I've ordered from here. Sometimes the dudes confused 'fries' with 'rice', but it's not like I especially NEED french fries. Prices are reasonable. They have a drive through.\n\nOne day I bought an Adobada burrito from Rivas and I swear to God it was THE BEST burrito I have ever had in my life. The pork was perfectly seasoned / perfect temperature and the tortilla was just perfect. Ugh. So good. Carne Asada is always great at Rivas. If you're into Carne Asada fries get them here.\n\nThe chile relleno isn't the best I've ever had, but definitely the best in comparison to small taco shops like Los Favoritos or Filibertos.","This place's food is pretty dang awesome.\n\nI ordered the \"Rolled Taco Supreme\" which is four (I think) rolled tacos piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and liberally topped with chopped, tasty carne asada chunks.  With a little pile of lettuce and a \"superior grade\" pico de gallo on the side.\n\nThe first time I had this, I literally INHALED IT.  It was that good.\n\nMy kids usually have the \"rolled tacos with guacamole\" plate and they dig on it.\n\nRivas' food is a step above the \"'Ertos\" places if you ask me.  And I've lived here 15 years and eaten at a lot of 'Ertos.\n\nIt's not fine dining by any stretch, but it's above average for the classification, and WAY good for a 24-hour joint.\n\nTry it.  Go ahead.  Really.  :)","Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!","Oh man, best place to get late night food ever!!  So many choices, and unlike most other cheapo mexican food places, this one does not make me sick after i eat there!  I absolutely LOVE the chimichangas and the california burrito with potatoes in it.  The enchiladas are awesome too, and you can see them prepare your food!  THe staff has always been friendly and the place is super clean, it does take a while to go through the drive through though. Also you get a ridiculous amount of food for your buck.  THe most i spend there is maybe $8 and i have at least two meals from it!","On the same level as Taco Bell.  Everything is covered in some-excuse-for-grated-cheddar cheese.\n\nGreasy, too salty, and downright mediocre at best.\n\nGo elsewhere if you want a good meal.","I may have eaten here 50 times and can say that i have ever gotten a bad burrito. The grilled chicken or ham breakfast burrito are fantastic and worth getting at any time of the day - which they are open for you. Not a pretty place - but pretty enough to get you some fantastic burritos - 5 stars no question.\n\nUpdate: Oh no - they changed their grilled chicken burro - NOOOOO.  4 starts until they bring the old direction back!\n\nUpdate: The have remodeled - and brought the old grilled chicken back!","Ah sweet, sweet, dependable Rivas. You're always there when I need you, which is almost exclusively after 1 a.m. or on a difficult Saturday morning. I'm sure you have other operating hours, but that seems hardly important.\n\nThe staff is legitimately friendly and helpful, especially at odd hours of the evening. The salsa bar is adequate and includes gratis pickled carrots. The menu is far too robust to try everything and can occasionally be difficult to navigate. Seriously, it's a 10 foot spread at least.\n\nThe food is exactly what you would expect when you walk in. Compared to FiliB's, Amado's, etc. it's completely serviceable; compared to Los Taquitos, it is lacking. Rivas does nothing to separate themselves from every other 24-hour Mexican joint save for slightly more generous portions. The carne asada fries, rolled tacos, and California burrito are the standouts of the operation, with the carne asada being consistently tender and the rolled tacos being smothered in delightful guacamole. Avoid the tacos and enchiladas, as both are damp in a manner that you do not typically associate with food. \n\nRivas is far from the best option in Tempe, but I still keep going back. That's gotta count for something.","Rolled Taco special was a bit disappointing. The tacos were not crunchy and were soft in the middle, leading to the ultimate rolled taco  soggy mess. It was 4 bucks for rolled tacos without carne asada, but 7 bucks with the meat and thats the only thing that is special about the special order. The Carne asada was average at best, too chewy and not all the fat trimmed away. Guacamole overwhelmed the five skinny tacos and cheese was not melted great. Horchata needed more taste, as the classic flavors of vanilla and cinnamom were tough to detect. PLace might be good for drunken students, but the experienced Mexican drive through tongue knows the truth.","This place has saved my life so many times.\n\nI love delicious, gigantic burritos, especially when I can get them 24 hours a day.\n\nSimple and sweet, that's all I need to say about Rivas.","I have been here several times for the carne asada fries. Not once have I had any problem until yesterday.  I mean it wasn't such a severe problem that I won't go back because it lasts a lot longer than your crispy delicious carne asada fries.  Now saying this makes the carne asada fries from this location sound disgusting by the fries not being crispy enough. They reminded me of steak fries with how thick they were.  I never have had carne asada fries that I happened to like more after sitting out for over an hour than fresh carne asada fries.  \n\nSo if I go to work in the morning I would probably enjoy some carne asada fries from rivas BY lunch time. =]","so awesome coming here after bar like timeout or monkey pants closes.  I come from a place where there are NO 24 hour burrito places and to me this is stuff of legend.  \n\n$4 for a gigantic burrito.\n\nGet the Cali/Arizona burrito.  SO GOOD.  I cannot confirm or deny the cleanliness of the place.","Rock the Rivas!\n\nIt's _bertos clone type shop.\n\nEverything is good and fresh... \n\nIt's cheap and quick.\n\nTheir Carne Asada is better than amado's and filli b's.\n\nHit it up after you're nice and drunk from rocking out at the Yucca Tap Room!","I love Riva's and I have yet to be disappointed! I always order the rolled tacos supreme *DROOOLS* and I would devour that stuff in like 0.67 seconds. Hahah jk, I actually can never finish all 4.. or is it 5 rolled tacos? Ehhh  anywho you get the idea. It is mmmmm delicious. Rivas over Filibertos-- allllll day babyyyyyy :D","super divey, even lower than filbertos.... good for college kids that need late night munchies but my husband got sick off the fish tacos... i guess when you are desperate and its the closest thing to you besides burger king it ok...","From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the giant breakfast burrito is delicious and huge!!!","Love the steak burrito. It's filled with steak and guacamole (just those two ingredients) and is great for anyone who has a dairy intolerance.\n\nPrices are very convenient, you can easily stop here and get a great meal for under $10.\n\nIt's also open 24 hours.","Loved the beef tacos. Perfect shell and great shredded beef. They didn't put onions or tomatoes in there like jerks which I love. \n\nThe \"cheese crisp\" (cheese quesadilla) was also good. Their salsa was nice also but just a tad watery. Great spot for a late night taco!!","Tortillas are AWESOME. Bean and cheese burrito is one of the best I've had from these types of places. Nachos were freakin delicious. Open late. Drive thru. \n\nI'll take it.","Just had the rolled taco supreme... OMG... This is THA BUSINESS! They could be fried a little softer, but other than that... This is perfect \"I work the night shift, and I'm starving and it's my turn to do the food run\" food.","Late afternoon, on Father's day\nRiva's is not busy, one other patron infront of us, and one arrived after us. \n\nWe've been here before, the food is tasty, but not spectacular.\nThe salsa bar is a plus, but you have to search or ask for it, as it is closed to prevent spoilage, or flies.  There is no A/C, so don't plan on eating here, either drive through, or carry out in the summer.... \n\nAnd BEWARE, although tasty, foods are not freshly made.  There is a microwave they use to heat food.  One of  my four Styrofoam containers was microwaved to the point of melting inside.","I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.\n\nFor one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.\n\nThe California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. \n\nNot a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like \"health code violations\" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.\n\nAnd it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit."],"business_id":"vSEFzop2GDXsIWTLxIGMiw","name":"Rivas Mexican Food","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Oh Gordo's.  I was SO excited when I saw the sign go up that they would be opening, that I would drive by every few days to check to see if they were open yet.  FINALLY, they were open, and I couldn't wait to try them out.  Well, I have now been twice, and both times have been really disappointed.  Sigh.  Here are my experiences:\n\nVisit 1:\n\nA couple days after they opened (so I was keeping an open mind & hoping they would \"settle\" into a groove and improve).  I asked the cashier guy what was good.  He recommended the pollo fundido burrito, which I happily ordered because you can never go wrong with that (or so I thought).  Also ordered a cheese quesadilla and a bean/cheese burrito (my husband and my \"staples\" at any mexican restaurant because it's a good way to compare apples to apples, or, burritos to burritos in this case).\n\nPollo fundido burrito: NOT worth what they charge, which is astronomical, something like $8 or $9 and it's just the burrito, no beans/rice or anything on the side.  The sauce on the top was really kind of sad.  Not much sauce first of all, and nothing to write home about that's for sure.  I literally felt like I was robbed by ordering this burrito.  Robbed of my money and robbed of my love for mexican food.  Just such a disappointing burrito.  \n\nBean/cheese burrito: MEH. Perhaps if they would have actually put some cheese in that bad boy it would have been good.  But the sprinkling of cheese (even though they charged extra for it) left something to be desired.\n\nQuesadilla: double meh.  Were they having a cheese shortage this night??  You would have thought so from the quesadilla.  Come on people, that's all there is in a quesadilla!  CHEESE!  How about you add some next time?!  One of the driest quesadillas I've had.  How can you screw up a quesadilla??  \n\nHot sauces: the red tastes more like a spicy marinara than a taco hot sauce.  Seriously, I would expect it to be on a pizza, not a burrito.  The green sauce was actually quite good.\n\nAll in all, a disappointment to say the least (my husband concurs on all of the above by the way!), but I was hopeful that it will just take a little time to get things running smoothly, etc.\n\nVisit 2 (about a week later):\n\nUsed the drive thru, which you can't actually order until you get to the window, FYI.  I sat at the window for a while before someone noticed me (the owner or manager I believe).  He told me he'd be with me in a minute, and came back again a little while later to take my order.  I ordered the shredded beef burrito combo plate but substituted shredded chicken instead.  I was asked to pull around to the front & he would bring me my food.  No biggie.  Got my food 5-10 minutes later (not ideal if you're in a hurry, but I wasn't so I didn't mind).\n\nGot home and again, disappointment set in as I started to eat.  This was literally the worst and driest chicken burrito I've ever had in my life. ZERO flavor, ZERO moisture, just simply a bad burrito.  The beans and rice were, well, beans and rice.  Nothing special, and a mediocre serving (especially the beans, perhaps there was a bean shortage this day?).\n\nThe combo was $8 and once again, I felt this was over priced for what I got (the portion, but more importantly the lack of flavor).\n\nThe red hot sauce seemed to be a \"little\" more like hot sauce instead of marinara sauce, but otherwise they have A LOT of work to do if they want to stay in business for the long term.\n\nI'm really hoping and pulling for them, because honestly, we NEED a good fast mexican food joint in this area, but right now I can't imagine going back there anytime soon (if ever).  I would much rather make the 20 minute round trip drive to Filiberto's than try this place again.  So so very sad.  :(  I hope they improve over time, I really do.  Fingers crossed.","went there tonight with my wife and 2 year old. We had 6 tacos some rice and 3 waters. $21.00 was what the bill came to. I could not believe that the Tacos were so lights, hardly any meat or cheese for a $2.50 taco. The kids working were friendly, but friendly unfortunately is what I'm paying for. I'm paying a price for a fair value and friendliness is expected. I can't see myself going there again or recommending. Instead I will share my experience and opinion with anyone I can. It's too bad since we are so sick of B King and McDonalds. We were hoping that this place would be good. Thumbs up for starting a business or branching off of Tailgaters. Thumbs down for providing minimal value. Owners are the same from Tailgaters. The food at both places is brutal. The flyers Gordos put out at Desert Fitness are hand written. These people obviously do not share the same passion as other eating places that succeed. Go eat at Trilogy. Kids eat free and you will pay less for way better food.","I'm not sure why we ate here after reading the reviews, but we gave it a shot. I had high hopes for the green chili chimi, but it was flavorless, as were the rice and beans. My boyfriend got the taco-enchilada-tostada combo, which was like something you'd get in a school lunch. Both salsas were just terrible. I'm fairly certain at least half of our food was microwaved leftovers. It was a disappointing experience and we will not be coming back.","Great portions, yummy burritos. Try the super fries, better yet ask for a super fries burrito! Friendly service, prices about what you'd expect. Daily specials. I usually have a breakfast burrito add green chile.","Came here in a good mood with high hopes. Got the food and was excited. My kids cheese enchiladas were ice cold. My husbands burrito was way to greasy and had nothing going for him. The nachos were a joke. Chips with melted cheese. That's it. No tomatoes no nothing. The only thing that was decent was the big cheese crisp that was still dry yet pretty good and if you were to get it then i recommend guacamole because it was very dry. Very disappointed.","I normally love little dive taco shops. I will start out by saying that the staff was very nice and polite. We ordered two bean and cheese burritos to go and it did not take long. I was optimistic at that point. Once we got home to eat we opened the bag and it smelled like seafood. The paper the food was wrapped in smelled like seafood and so did the burritos. The burritos were way over filled. With one bite the tortilla tore and it fell apart. We could not finish our food and were really disappointed.","Food is always really good! Fast if you call it in for drive thru otherwise about 10min or more. They have always been really nice & apologetic for wait!","Not sure why this place rated as expensive... average price is about  $6. Staff were  friendly and food was made fresh. Will definitely be coming back","If someone decided to run a cafeteria out of their garage, it would be exactly like Gordo's. That is all you really need to know, so feel free to stop reading here.\n\nI was very excited and hoping for a local treasure of a mexican food place just a couple blocks from home. I REALLY wanted to like this place!  What a disappointment. I ordered steak fajita taco salad to go. No, I did NOT do that in the drive through since it is clearly marked CALL AHEAD drive through. As I waited (a reasonable amount of time) for my food, I glanced at what people at the very few tables inside were eating.  Everything I saw looked soupy and slushy and pastel colored - all anemic shades of cafeteria food with no eye appeal at all.\n\nMy food smelled great but when I got home and dug in, the steak was barely chewable and tasted old, vaguely reminiscent of liver.  No idea why they called it salad - there was the slightest sprinkle of shredded lettuce in the bottom of the taco shell bowl, literally a spoon or so of mushy tasteless rice and about the same amount of whole pinto beans that I swear came right out of a cafeteria 5# can.  The whole thing was like hospital food at best. Geez, if I can't even get lettuce in a dish labelled salad, then I know the Mayans were right - the world IS coming to an end.  Sadly, I am pretty sure that is true at least for Gordo's.","My family and I moved from San Jose CA last summer and was looking for a good authentic Mexican joint. We tried so many places and none were authentic; all Americanized. We were so happy when Gordo's opened. Went there Grand Opening and since then we go every weekend and sometimes during the week for dinner. Frank (owner) treats us like family; well they actually all treat us like family. This is what you call REAL Mexican food!!!!!","Decided to try something new for dinner the other night, and stumbled upon Gordo's.  Their menu was pretty standard for a Mexican food place.  The drive thru is a nice option when you're in a hurry as well.  For a drive thru Mexican food place, I thought the food was great.  It definitely beats Filly-B's and I'll be going back to try their breakfast menu.","Better that Filly B's. fresh ingredients. I loved the Tina burro with fresh avocado and pico ! We will be back!","Ok I have been here at least 5 or more times.I enjoy their chicken calle tacos and chimis. However I tried the chicken enchiladas combo and was a bit disappointed. The shredded pollo was seasoned good and the red sauce was thin. However the side of rice was literally a teaspoon full. Really? Disappointing for $7 bucks.","My husband and I tried this place out because it was close and had a coupon deal. My husband for the Ava pollo fundido and was pretty good. The beans have ZERO taste!! I had the enchiladas... They were made with corn tortillas and had a weird taste. So disappointing. Glad I didn't pay full price! Don't think I will be back sadly.","Love this place! Eat here 2-3 times a week and always call ahead for takeout.  Food is very fresh and the salsa's are good. My personal favorite are the fish tacos.. however the\n Gordo burrito is a close second! Thank you Gordo's for great food!","Ate here once and my bean burro literally stunk like fish! Seemed to come from their wrapping paper. Restaurant was dirty but staff was nice. Too bad the food was so awful, and mexican is my fave.","Comparable prices to other similar Mexican food restaurants in town but much cleaner here. My favorite is the Carter burro and their large selection of glass bottle soda. All the staff is very nice no matter what time of day you go in.","Have been twice in last 2 months.  This place is on my way home...(work at val vista/202 and live in Queen Creek).  I agree with Renata K's review.  I was not impressed the first time I went.  I had the Arizona Burrito...it was a touch on the greasy side, and really not much overall flavor.  I wouldn't call it bad, just something you could make better at home, therefore NOT worth spending money for.  \nI gave them another try today.  Ordered a Carnitas burrito, because Carnitas is what I compare mexican places by.  \nUnfortunately this was again a burrito with no real flavors.  Very big, but very bland.  From now on I think I will just spend my burrito money at Los Fav's down the street.","Nice Guys, \n\nThe Breakfast egg burrito was A-Ok.  Try the verde salsa, unique.  Just a note: the prices even for dinner are all under $8.  Seem to me to be a decent value.","I'm with Moopet not sure why we ate here after reading the reviews but we did.  We got a green chili burrito which was pretty good but not great. Chips were good salsa is very strong oregano flavor which is not to my liking but my wife liked it. I got the fish taco which for $3 a expected more. The fish was a small once frozen fish stick and was topped with cheddar cheese, cabbage, and a chipolte sauce. Possibly the worst fish taco I have had. Beans are peppery pinto beans just like Rubios.","I had the sausage breakfast burrito and my girlfriend had the bacon breakfast burrito. Both were fantastic! Not dry like most breakfast burritos from the chains. Also pricing was very reasonable. Service was good from start to finish on our order. Two thumbs up. This is a must try for breakfast if you are in the area. I plan to try a lunch/dinner item next. After which, I will update my review to include the latter.","I am really happy to write this updated review, and I'm glad I went back to give them another chance! The food has improved significantly since last year, and I'm in love with their red salsa/hot sauce (although I wish they would fill up the little cups they serve them in so I don't have to ask for a million of them).  \n\nPrices are a little high compared to other similar places, but for the convenience/location next to my neighborhood it's worth it. Oh, and by the way, the tortillas are awesome. \n\nWay to go Gordo's!","The main complaint I would give is the time it takes to prepare the food in drive thru.  Just be prepared to wait as long as you would in the store just that you are doing it in your car.\n\nAll the food is good and have not had any issues with quality or taste.\n\nWould recommend if you are looking for some good Mexican food.","Very average. Not bad, but not good either. There are much better local options.","So so BAD! \n1st visit- Beans must have been a week old and the rice even older. How do you screw up rolled tacos?\n2nd- 20 minutes in drive thru for 2 mini tacos and jr. bean burrito. They initially handed me the wrong order and then took it back.  They apologized and said they had a mix-up with a bunch of orders.  Glanced in the rearview mirror only to be confused that I was the ONLY car in the drive thru.  When I arrived home, I discovered that my order was again incorrect.  Even the incorrect food was terrible.  Never again.\nToo bad nice building!","Good Mexican food. Great value!","Good food. Get it to go. Dining room is dirty. Our high chair was filled with old food. Also, they apparently turn off the A/C at night, which makes for a hot early lunch experience. Cheese enchilada is okay, but shredded beef tacos are awesome.","The green chile chimi is by far my favorite thing here.  The salsa is a work in progress and they are asking for feedback to make it better (which hat tip to them for doing so and listening to their customer)  The drive thru is a little slow, and when I got home I got a Fajita chimi when I ordered a Green Chile one, but I will not slam them for that here - would be stupid since the food is so good, my only suggestion would be to make sure and not turn into a McDonalds where every drive thru order is wrong - maybe double check and go over again with person while in car?  Who knows, but I would suggest giving this place a try .. really good so far based on what I have had.","Tried Gordo's out for dinner. Went through drive thru. Took 20 mins to receive food. Ordered enchiladas, chicken chimi, nachos in cheese and a kids meal with taco. It cost $39! Was really surprised! You can eat at Serranos for cheaper and about as fast. Was really hoping for this experience to be different! Staff seemed over whelmed and not very friendly.","Great breakfast burros and hot sauce. Will be back very soon to try the rest.","Food was really good! I ordered the bean chimichanga and it was huge. :) The people are very nice, great service! I will definitely come again! :)","Gordos is great food for the price. The staff is very friendly and accomudating. They're breakfast burritos are as good as anyone in the area. For me it all starts with the tortilla and they have quality tortillas. I also like that they have a salsa bar.","The burritos here are the best in the area. I used to drive to Burrito Shack, but now I just get the Gordos or California Burrito here. They are filling and taste great. In fact even my teenager was full. The salsa I think is just okay, not great. They also give you free hot coffee too.  The prices are average for a burrito, but it's definitely a great value. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but if you want a good burrito, give them a try!","Great food and really good prices! Staff is good most the time and has always got the order right. 3 words: Ava Pollo Fundido. If you like a Jalepeno kick and chicken chimichangas then that's your dish. Carne Asada Quesadilla is the bomb and they give you guac and sour cream FREE here! Nice little joint and nice to support local places.","My favorite local Mexican place! I can't stay away! I absolutely love their cheese enchiladas. Their 99 cent Monday through Thursday deals are nice add-ons. I also like their bean and cheese burritos, although it wouldn't kill them to add a bit more cheese. Sometimes the service is less than stellar (slow speed, credit card machine issues, unfriendly male employee), but nothing awful enough to keep me away for long.","I've driven by many times, but never stopped.  With a restaurant.com certificate in-hand we stopped this time.\n\nIt's a very small place.  I would estimate 10 tables/booths.  You order at a counter and they bring it to you when it's done.  The menu is a sign above the counter.  Very \"divey\".\n\nOur group ordered a variety of things.  As always, at  a \"new\" place I order a chimi (or, in this case, burro because they didn't have a chimi).  It was very good.  Everyone seemed to like their food.  For the price this is pretty good.  The ambiance sucks, but the food is what you come for.  Not the best Mexican I've had, but definitely the best within about 10 miles of my house.","This is a great authenticate Mexican food restaurant. The food is good but the place is a little run but overall a god eat!","Went here for thr first time today. I ordered the surf and turf burrito and my hub ordered carnitas torta. You can tell the meat wasn't just thrown on the cook top. They marinate their meat and it was very tasty. My husband thought it was the best tasting carnitas ever. and he has had plenty of carnitas in his life. Its usually it's very dry but here is wasn't. \nSalsa bar stocked with good salsa and service was good. \nCan't wait to go back and try more stuff.","Just okay. I was craving Mexican good but didn't feel like getting out of car on way home, so I bought the yelp promo! Thank goodness I only paid $5! The carnitas was tough and dry, the red chile meat was the cheapest cut of meat allowable for human consumption. Not all bad though, the rice and beans were good. And the $.99 tostada was good too. IF I go back, it will be for rice, beans and tostada. Afraid to try anything else!","Good chorizo and Egg burritos"],"business_id":"wOL5PrOe0yG0wWz7aAEoXQ","name":"Gordo's Mexican Food","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Pedros serves up everything you would want from an Americanized, cheesey Mexican restaraunt. They have some over the top mariachi music playing in the dining room, fake parrot cages hanging from the ceiling, free chips and salsa, solid service, gigantic burritos smothered in cheese and a ginormous variety of margaritas. While I won't venture to say this represents anything close to legitimate Mexican cuisine, it is exactly what the doctor ordered for like 95% of Madisonians.\n\nMy favorite things about this place:\n-Fresh tortillas, pressed and warmed in the dining room\n-Flavored Margarita variety, because Strawberry should be standard, but blue is something to be applauded\n-Corn cakes - don't waste your sides on anything else, double down on these guys\n-Karaoke in the bar with super cheap margarita mugs\n-Seafood Suiza - even with olives (yuck) this is my favorite enchilada anywhere\n-Fried Ice Cream - this place is where it was invented as far as I'm concerned\n\nPro tip: Don't order off the menu for your kids, a buttered tortilla with crushed up chips and a little salsa is probalby the best thing they have, and its not even on the menu. Pretty awesome, don't knock it til you try it.","Stopped at this place on a ride from Minnesota to Chicago, on my way back to california--the beacon of good mexican food in the US...so I was excited to see what this place had to offer! Very friendly staff and reasonable prices on  generous portions. We were started off with the customary chips and salsa, which was quite tasty, and then a fun treat--warm fluffy tortillas which we could put butter or sugar on. These were amazing...I liked this change. I was getting full by this point and the entree hadn't even been served. We also got some guac which was made in a cool manner with some great ingredients table side. Delicious. When my vegetarian tamales finally came, I was already pretty full and managed to eat half of one and a yummy corn cake. The tamale was a little spicy for my taste, but not bad. The margarita wasn't the most amazing, but also not bad. A good little experience passing thru Madison.","Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place. Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food. I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen. Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu. The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables. I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes.","Decent menu selections, better than average service for a restaurant outside of downtown, and a fair price.  It is hardly authentic, but we dine with our six year old often and Pedro's is a great place for kids or to go after work to watch the game.  They have changed the salsa twice and it still sucks.  I was informed by the manager that the old recipe was 'too spicy' for people in this overgrown Mayberry.  Over all it is decent with pretty good service.  4 stars are for value and service.","DO NOT EAT HERE!  The food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box.  Yes, they have homemade tortillas, but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it.  Even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos.\n\nInstead, take a short drive to Cuco's on Buckeye Rd off of Stoughton and ask for Diana.  She makes great margaritas :)","Let me just get this out of the way. I grew up in Madison and for years this was my favorite Mexican place. I thought it was the best possible place...anywhere. Then I moved to Phoenix and had real Mexican food and now....\n\nI wanted to review this place because it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers are making it sound. Their salsa and chips are fresh and some of the best around. They serve you fresh warm tortillas with your meal that go well with anything. Some of the pre-meal quesadillas are fantastic. My favorite dish here is the Bean Burrito with red sauce. The way the beans and cheese are melted together just makes it so craveable. \n\nStill, a lot of this food is simply not authentic, and more than a few are on the heavy side. You will walk away feeling full and likely be on the toilet for a little while the next day. There is no way around this.\n\nThe simple truth is that there is no superb mexican food here in Madison, and Pedro's fits right in to this muddy amalgam of mediocrity. Some things it does well though, and the cheap drinks on a Thursday night usually make for a good atmosphere.","I went here last night slummin'.  Uh huh, that's right, I said it.  \n\nThis is not the go to place for authentic Mexican food, by now most people know this.  It's what many would call \"Americanized.\"  I had the enchiladas suiza.  One with cheese, one with spinach.  The flavors appealed to the \"fat American who likes cheese\" in me.  The freezer burned spinach with crunchy leaf stems was not so pleasing however.  \n\nI wasn't overly offended by anything, because I went in here knowing it would be mediocre Americanized Mexican food complete with kitschy  decor.  \n\nBonuses of the night included well, not much, but hey, the waitress was hot.","I like this place... When you go there you know what you are going to get; warm cheesy comfort food, that is definitely not mexican. But if you go there knowing what to expect, you won't be disappointed.\nCheck their name of the day, you get a free meal! \nAnd its fun to go for half price margs on Tuesdays and Thursday, which usually coincides with karaoke or the fueling pianos.  I like what one reviewer said though, def don't dress up of you are going to drink here... You will get hit on by creepers and townies.","The item you pick for your dinner can quite literally make or break the experience here.  That is, your cheesy, Americanized Mexican food experience.  I tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful.  No cheese anywhere, no flavor, just HOT.  Ok yes, the menu indicates this a \"spicy\" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck.  \n\nUnfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress.  Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip.  His heavy sighs, eye rolls, and general lack of even being around 99% of the time led me to believe he was channeling his inner emo and couldn't be bothered.  \n\nWe were sat next to a group of teenage girls, which by automatic default says \"we hate you and want you to die.\"  They talked very loudly about their sexual escapades and did that annoying screech laughing.  I get it, I was a teenager once too, but if I could go back in time I'd kick my own teenaged ass.  \n\nThe food, service, and ambiance was like the time I fell off my motorcycle and got really bad road rash.  I hope I won't be doing that again any time soon.","Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:\n\n1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.\n\n2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)\n\nBeing a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that.","By all common sense i should detest this place, over-salted food... check, stereotypical music... yup... includes ranch in food... oh yes. (and then there are the monstrous portion sizes) I keep coming back because they have 1/2 priced margaritas on Thursdays, a fairly decent happy hour, fresh tortillas, fresh ingredients, and decent service.  The food plays to the lowest common denominator so my friends who hate all things not-American food can find something they enjoy. If you want authentic Mexican go to S. Park Street and hit up El Pastor. (for serious) Also If you have to choose between the east side Pedro's or the west side location.. hands down pick the west. (east is a tad dumpy)","All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up.  Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par.  Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas.","First of all, they charged us to split an entree.  In fact, we had to do the splitting - I guess they charge to have access to an extra plate.  The mushrooms in our enchilada were canned, and then burned.  The ranchero sauce tasted like the red sauce that comes with Spaghetti-O's.   The chips and salsa was less spectacular than the stuff I buy on sale at the grocery store.  The part I depend on most to get me through crappy Mexican food - margaritas - also disappointed.  They tasted like Kool-Aid (but without adequate water) and lacked tequila.  This was all at the west side location, and I hear the east side is even worse.  No vuelvo.","Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food. All their food is canned process nonsense. It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline. Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it.","Holy hell, what happened to this place?? This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan. I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary pretentiousness toward anything that's not \"edgy,\" such as old-school Americanized Mexican food.\n\nUnfortunately, it turns out any snobbery against Pedro's may be justified. My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience. The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that \"kick\" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.\n\nThe premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town. Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels. Looks like we'll be checking out the newer competitors on our next visit to Madison.","Bad service. Waiter was rude and obnoxious.  We never got refills on drinks or salsa. The menus were sticky. Fajitas came out w literally one tablespoon of cheese..we live in Wisconsin! !! The chimichangas were on point though.","o.k. it is Pedros, but the baked Friday night fish is the best I had in Madison.  Great texture, spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great too.   Of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome.  The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great surpise for Friday fish.","I'm not going to lie to you, this food is nowhere near Mexican, but the enchilada suiza is delicious in it's own right (ignore the side dishes, blech!).  The margaritas are delicious, and if you go on half-price Thursdays, very reasonable.  They have a good price on their lunch menu.   I wouldn't say I recommend it necessarily if you are looking for authentic Mexican...buuut, eh, it's tasty once in a while.","Pedros is a staple in the community.  A great place where you can bring family and friends to have a really good time.  The food is all made fresh, which is great.  For the price and the selection, you really can't beat it.\n\nOne other thing to mention...  Have had a group event at Pedro's - and also a couple events catered.  The catering menu is great - and they make it really easy.","You cannot compare Pedro's to the other big Mexican food presence, Laredo's.  Pedro's has home made tortillas, Laredo's does not.  Pedro's gives you a much bigger bowl of salsa that Laredo's.  I never have to look around for a refill.  But the salsa tastes vary different between the two restaurants.  The Mexican rice at Pedro's is very tomatoey (?)  Service at Pedro's is not as good as Laredo's.  Overall, Pedro's deserves a look.","This West location is now CLOSED.   Owner would like to reopen in the future.","Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos.","If I could give no stars, I would have. Coming from Texas, this place is a disappointment. It just sucks. They have real Mexican's working for them, yet they can't even make an even tortilla. They are always puffy, misshapen, to thick etc. Most of the food comes out cold and doesn't even make sense. Disgusting!","The west side location was way better. After they shut down I started going to this one. The food isn't as good and the fresh made tortillas are always either hard, cold, or burnt. Half the time I'm there they screw up my order. One time there was a miscommunication between the waitress and my boyfriend which ended up costing us $7. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal if the manager at first told the waitress to tell us she wasn't there and when she did finally come out she didn't apologize, make any effort into making the situation any better, and then started repeating the same thing over and over again so we'd shut up. A couple of my friends and I have decided to never go back here. Hopefully the west side one will open up again.","The fajitas were awesome and the tortillas were fresh from the tortilla-machine which was kinda fascinating. Delicious corn cakes. The fish tacos however were shitty, the fish was fishy, dry and not enough of it, Maciek had a dry tortilla, which is weird since they were all fresh and everything. All in all it was pretty good and the service was great, they stayed open way past closing time for us.","Food is ok. Fajitas were pretty good. Enchiladas left much to be desired. Service is ok, kind of slow especially if you have 8 or more people. Table is served the standard chips and salsa. Also served fresh tortillas and butter which I have never seen anywhere else and were very good.","There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be \"Mexican.\" That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be. That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a \"Mexican Restaurante\" just because there's an \"e\" at the end of \"Restaurant.\" \n\nAfter my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want \"Mexican.\" It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook. \n\nThis place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine.","Not bad.  They had a great Valentine's Day special that we went here for, and the service was prompt and we got our food quickly.  Our waiter was friendly (they have been whenever I've gone) and the food was pretty tasty.  All in all, not much to separate Pedro's from the other Mexican restaurants in the area, and it certainly isn't the best out there, but decent in price, quality and service for sure (the Seafood Suiza is the best there, in my honest opinion, but all other foods are just ok).","This place has the potential to be an adult chuck e. cheese for happy-hour-nacho-and-beer-aficionados... however, thats not the experience I had. I sat down and immediately wondered what was in store. What followed (a bland burrito) was both surprising (not in a good way) and disappointing (for the obvious blandness). In short, the food left much to be desired. I did enjoy the kitschy ambiance but it did not make up for subpar food. Venture into this establishment at your own risk.","I love this place!  Was sooooo sad when I found out the Wisc Dells location closed.  So, detoured into Madison on the ride home and still got my fix of yummie fresh hot chips and salsa with a tasty strawberry marg.  Onto my fav dish, the Enchiladas seafood suiza, yum.  My fav mexican place to date.","Pedro's really only deserves two stars, but more on that later.  Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food.  But there are some things on the menu that are perfectly fine should you find yourself here for some reason, at a loss as to what to order.  I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T.V. dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex.  I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty.  Not authentic--but perfectly fine.  They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I met my S.O. at Pedro's: hence the extra star.  It will always have a special place in my heart, and I'll keep coming back most Tuesdays for trivia night.","Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average. BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces). Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait.","Absolute worst Mexican food I have ever eaten, period. \n\nIt's like Mexican food for people who don't like Mexican food. Much of the food had little taste to it. I would rather eat Taco Bell, and I don't like Taco Bell.","Pedro's was some of the better that I have tasted in Madison.  Being from AZ, Mexican food which is \"amazing\" is hard to find.  Their salsa had a good flavor.  One thing which was great is their tortillas, fresh made and if dipped in the con queso sauce they are even better!  The service was not amazing, drinks were empty a lot.  Overall Pedro's is eatable, if you want authentic Mexican then this is not the place for you.","I have to give Pedro's a \"good news, bad news\" review.  I tried the Camarones wrap -  big mistake.  The shrimp were barely warm and slimy.  The rest of the filling in the wrap was also unappetizing; shredded lettuce and maybe some tomatoes in a disgusting creamy sauce.  After 2 bites I had to give up, I couldn't choke down any more.\n\nI give the waiter credit though.  When I complained he offered to bring me something else or take if off the bill with no argument.  My party ordered the \"table\" Guacamole, a 2 avocado version mixed to your preference at the table.  That was very good. \n\nSo try the table guac, but give the shrimp wrap a pass.  The waiter was also truly nice.  So like I say, good news, bad news.","I last visited Pedro's in the mid 1990s, so it's been a while since I've swung-in. A large group of us arrived after a show on Friday, April 18. There were 15 of us, and it was 10:45pm.\n\nDespite us wandering-in so late, and despite the fact that the crew had mostly cleaned-up for the night (we were the only people there), the staff was *extremely* friendly, accommodating, prompt, and helpful. \n\n+ It looks exactly the same as I remember it from back in the day\n+ Decent tap selection\n+ INCREDIBLE tap prices - I got a 32oz mug of Lake Louie for $6\n\n- Cadillac margarita was served warm (despite being on rocks) - not sure how that happened, but it happened twice. \n- Cadillac margarita delivered a nice headache the next day. That's unusual, as we normally don't experience one when we have \"good\" tequila. I'm uncertain what type of tequila they use in the cadillac version, but I suspect it was still closer to \"rail\"\n\n+ Good chips and salsa, and they were complimentary, even though we didn't order any other food\n\n+ Tons of seating options\n- Tables/chairs - looking a little dated and some were quite wobbly\n\nAll-in-all, this was a great option for our group, and I couldn't have been any happier than I was with the service. It was really, really outstanding. I'd return for drinks and appetizers again.","Top 3 high/low lights\n\n1) interior is kind of dumpy/old\n2) great service\n3) average quality food\n\nHad dinner at Pedro's on a recent weeknight. I had never been before but have always noticed that the place looks a little dumpy/weathered from the outside. Sometimes restaurants that don't look like much from the outside can end up being amazing so we decided to give it a try. The inside of the restaurant is also older looking and probably in need of a refresh. However , the place is gigantic and it was nice to be seated right away. The service was quick and we were bought a basket of chips and salsa (gluten free!) and a basket of warm flour tortillas (sadly not gluten free). I had a mango margarita (Pedro's has lots of options for their house margs) which was great. They have a gluten free menu within their standard menu and as with most Mexican restaurants there are lots of g free options. I had tacos in corn tortillas with veggies and rice on the side. The food was just ok, not awful but not stellar either. The veggies and rice were luke warm which was disappointing. My boyfriend had the fajitas which he said were \"just ok\" as well. I wouldn't mind stopping in again if I am in the east side of town but wouldn't go out of my way to come here.","Went with a friend who remembered it being good from years ago. The service was barely adequate. I ordered the $10 Asado burrito. I kid you not there was 8-10 small peices of cut up steak. That was it. The rest of the burrito was onion. It was so bad I actually got sick and threw it up when I got home. I can't believe the ridiculous prices for a small amount of food. I could have made that entire meal for less than $3 at home. I'll never go back. And I'll make sure to let all my friends know not to bother going at all. Very Disappointing!","great fresh tortillas and chip and ask salsa ask for the hot salsa reasonable priced kids menu even better deal on sundays love the seafood burrito with shrimp good enchildas probarly not true authentic mexician but my family has always liked it good place for large groups service is solid we come as much as any sitdown resturant in town","Service at the bar was good, food not so good.  My fault for ordering mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant.  Entree size very small for the price.","Pedros is a decent chain for Mexican Resturants, however it comes no where near the good authentic stuff you can have down south!\n\nStarting off with the chips and salsa is always so good, but so filling, by the time my food comes, its all I can do to eat more!  The tortillas are also to die for, a little butter and they are heaven!\n\nChick Enchiladas Suiza are the only way to go! I always have a side of corn cakes as they are delicious!","Pedro's is a place that I remember fondly from my childhood. We used to eat there from time-to-time when I was a kid.  \n\nSadly, the place hasn't seemed to evolve much since the 80's.  We went for an early dinner one night before seeing a show in Madison.  We were seated at about 4:30 pm, and were the only ones in the dining room.  The decor is 80's \"americanized Mexico.\" It looked exactly as I remember it from years ago.  It did seemed to be kept up.\n\nI was really looking forward to the hot fresh tortillas they used to serve.  There is a tortilla maker in the middle of the dining room.  Unfortunately, the machine wasn't running.  I can understand that since the place was pretty empty, but the tortillas they gave us were dry and hard.  They had been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit disappointing.\n\nI had a burrito, it was ok.  Nothing too exciting.  In the 80's and 90's it would have been great, but Mexican food in Wisconsin has gotten so much better over the years.  \n\nI still love their chips and salsa, though!  However, that probably isn't enough to bring me back again anytime soon.","Badger game disappointment! Watered down drinks, slow service and rude management! \n\nMy husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's. Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years. The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game...\n\nTonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.\n\nThe kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.\n\nWe asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! \n\nWorst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,\"Ok.\" \n\nHe clearly doesn't care about his customers! Awful!","The only thing good about this place is Tuesday and Thursday is half price Margaritas... That and they have a chip, salsa, cheese and bean buffet with that.","The food was really really good. Fast and courteous service.  The prices and menu selection was very reasonable. I plan on returning for future visits.","I love hosting large groups here! They are so accommodating, will do separate checks and provide excellent customer service. I've had at least 5 events with parties of 20+ people (sometimes even last minute) and they don't bat an eye. \n\nThe food is pretty good and they have a very large bar selection. The tortillas are fresh and my favorite dish is the shrimp fajitas."],"business_id":"wPidHd5FxspPRgVqdEQ-Xw","name":"Pedro's Mexican Restaurante","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Chipotle is amazing, and this one is no different from all of the others. Fast service, great food, reasonable price.\n\nGet the bowl not the burrito for more food. I think they charge 99 cents for a tortilla with the bowl so it is no longer free. I was originally mad about this but it makes sense for them. Also make sure to get salad dressing on the bowl, it makes it infinitely better.","two words: burrito bowl. \n\ngood for you (i mean within reason, this is mexican takeout), inexpensive, and oh so good!","I've never had a \"bad\" experience at chipotle cause seriously, how could you go wrong at chipotle? Ever?! Maybe it's just my unlucky day. The dude who was making my order just seemed like he dreaded working there. Now I understand that when you're having a bad day, it might be hard to smile and act friendly, but don't take it out on my food!!! I'm paying $8 for this piece of **** so make it right. He was being so stingy on EVERYTHING he added to my bowl, from the rice to the veggies to the corn, I had to repeatedly ask him \"could you put more?\" ...which I've NEVER had to do at a chipotle. Awkward as it already is, when we got to the end he asked me \"anything else?\" And I'm like, no I think I'm good, thanks. And then he's like \"are you SURE??\" What on earth! Now I'm getting attitude?!?!!! At a damn chipotle? Jeez!","I love their food!!! The favor is out of this world.","Who doesn't like Chipotle? They're always consistently good, the place is clean, and the staff friendly. I like that the food is always fresh, nothing processed. The boyfriend always gets the steak burrito and I tend to always get either a steak bowl or tacos. And I'm basically addicted to that corn salsa. You can't really go wrong by eating here.","Good food made to order.\n\nEven though it's chain food it's good.","I used to be a weekly lunch customer, but not as often now.  I was at CFS and after perusing the food court, I decided on Chipotle.  As much as I was craving a burrito, I wasn't up for the 1,200 calorie splurge.  So, I opted for the rice bol which was just as good and much lighter.  I noticed that they've raised their prices again....yes, I'm very price conscious these days.  \n\nTheir rice is delish...love the lime and cilantro flavor, pinto beans, grilled chicken, corn and mild salsa, lettuce and sour cream on the side.  Nice sized portion which I'm fnishing off for dinner as we speak :)","On the rare occasion I eat fast food, this is one place I would choose over 99% of any other place. The quantity is decent, the quality is better than most fast food, and the flavors are good. Plus, you can get a reasonably health meal.","YUMMMMMM!!!!!  My favorite food!  Lots of scrumptious, nutritious options!","cant go wrong with it but the folks here need to learn little better how to roll the burritos, guess it comes with experience :) .\nAlways fresh and will love to eat there again. \nNo difference then any other chipotle chain :)","well, i have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for burritos, and this place is like heaven for me.\n\nthese GIANT burros comes wrapped in a huge, steamy tortilla, with your choice of black or pinto beans, grilled veggies, rice, chicken (or go all veg) and fixin's like sour cream and pico. it's a long counter ordering/instruction process...like subway.\n\nthey conveniently wrap it all in foil so you can eat it with your hands (it takes two).","Chipotle is one of my favorite mexican restaurants.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends, but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.\n\nThis Chandler Mall location is nice because it allows my wife I to eat in the food court so the kids can get their favorite meal.  FYI though, this is not in the food court.  It is outside by the fountains.  It is a good value because the burrito's are huge.","I'm obsessed with their salads.\n\nI used to be obsessed with their burritos, until once I tried their salad... I was sold.\n\nTheir salads are fresh, and the dressing is SOOO good.  I could drink it.","Chipotle in Phoenix has gone organic, hormone free with their meat! Yay! The stores in California have been using Niman Ranch meat for quite a while (they're a group of humane organic ranchers). \n\nI don't know that AZ stores are using Niman, but they made an announcement today that they are going organic, hormone free. So your prices might be a few dimes higher, but BRAVO, Chipotle!","Welcome to Burrito Heaven.  There's room for everyone here.\n\nIf you have not been to Chipotle, you must.  It is like looking at the face of God and having him stare back, saying \"You are my most wondrous creation.\"\n\nPeople always say \"What's the big deal about a burrito joint anyway?\"  Nothing.  But this is a burrito joint like the Super Bowl is a football game.  You start with a giant tortilla.  You start with three small flour tortillas.  You start with a bowl.  You just start.  \n\nWhat you do from there is your choice, and each choice is rewarding, fulfilling and fresh.  The cilantro-lime rice is steaming when you get it and its citrus-y smell is what I imagine angels might smell like (or the inside of a bottle of Corona or something.  Use your imagination, damn it).\n\nThe meats are incredible too.  Chicken is grilled and chopped right where you can see it.  Barbacoa, a slow-simmered and spiced shredded beef, is elegant in its flavors and its tenderness.  The Carnitas, a roasted, shredded pork, is juicy and succulent.  And don't get me started on the Steak...cooked medium and spiced with adobo, it's slightly spicy and super-deelish.\n\nThe salsa, from the standard but fresh pico de gallo to the roasted corn salsa to the hot (with seeds) and green mediums, are all a perfect compliment to any and all of the meats, and you can experiment around as you see fit.  Sour cream?  Cheese?  Sure.  But don't cheap out on the extra money you have to pay to get the guacamole.  Thick, chunky, creamy green Jesus in vegetable form is what you'll find, and I swear to God if I find out any of you skip the guacamole, I'll hunt you down and Buffalo-Bill your asses.\n\nThe guacamole is so good, it makes Ghandi look like a child-pornographer.\n\nThen they wrap it up in foil.  They hand it to you.  You pay.  You sit down at your seat.  You reach to pick it up and, after feeling the weight of it, think to yourself that maybe you need to hit the gym or something.  You've grown weak.\n\nOnly you haven't grown weak.  You're just holding what amounts to about a 2-3 pound piece of Burrito-Christ.  Rip off the foil.  Bite into it.  Taste it.  Savor it.  Paint out your feelings of how great it is on a canvas, lock it away for a year, open it up a year later and view it again.  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.\n\nOk, so I'm being over-dramatic.  Sue me, I love Chipotle and everyone I've ever known who has come with me to experience has walked away enlightened and full to the brim.  \n\nI should be like a Chipotle shaman or something, I swear :D","awesome customer service every time and great food.. love eating here!","Previously I wrote how I had fallen in love with the vegetarian crunchy tacos. While these are still delish, I have a new love in my life and that's the soft flour vegetarian tacos. Here's what I do:\n- Brown rice\n- Black beans (the pinto beans have bacon)\n- Fajitas (peppers & onions)\n- Medium salsa\n- Corn\n- Lettuce\n- Guacamole\n\nI bet these are REALLY good with sour cream and cheese as well, but I'm trying to cut out the dairy. The medium salsa is AMAZINGGGG! I can't believe that after all of these years I am now just discovering it. \n\nI really like this location. The employees are really upbeat, positive, friendly, and very very helpful. The restaurant is always clean and you can tell that the kitchen where they cook everything is spotless.","My kids like the tacos here.  I'll usually park and have them go in by themselves and order. They never had any problems.\n\nI really like the corn salsa. I call it that because that's what it tastes like. It's super tasty.  It really should he their signature item, like Chevy's mushed corn side.","It hurts me to have to give any Chipolte a single star but I am afraid that I have to.  Yesterday while enjoying a salad at this location I noticed a little black bug laying on its back in the bottom of my bowl with its feet kicking up in the air.  Gross, YUCK, and seriously were my initial thoughts as I held down my stomach flipping.  When I brought this bug to a workers attention I was told that they \"Try\" to wash the lettuce but sometimes this happens.  Sorry to say that this does not help me forgive the experience because I cannot help but think of all the bugs I may have eaten and not have known it.","Now I love Chipotle....I've been to many indifferent states and I've always gotten consistently good food I can always rely on.  So when I thought I try a new location on the way home  I could not believe how disappointed I was about to be.  After watching the people in line order, I noticed the guy was putting 2 spoonfuls of rice on everyones burrito...now I know it's a filler but come on!!  So I asked him to go easy on the rice, which to him meant 1 heaping big spoonful followed by the tinyest portions of beans and meat.  You have to be kidding me.  So I asked for some more beans to which I got an incredible glare and probably what led to the even smaller amounts of meat.  \n\nOk, if I hadn't sat down to eat there I may never have noticed what was to follow.  Every single man had HUGE portions in their burrito bowl as they took their meal to the table and every woman has small portions...interesting.  Just because I may not eat as much as some men, doesn't mean I don't like leftovers.  \n\nSorry I guess this franchise has plenty of money coming in...they definitely don't need any of mine.","Everything i get here is amazing. When i can't afford a bunch of food i just get chips and salsa..and guacamole. Hot salsa has flavor even though its really hot, i love it. The staff is very friendly. I've never had a problem with anything at all.","ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh the burrito bowl!\nI, for some reason, don't feel like such a hog when I have the bowl, as opposed to their gigantic burritos!\nThe barbacoa is delish!  \nI also like that you can choose which beans you want: black or pinto.  Several different salsas to choose from.\nStaff is always friendly, too.  \nI usually go to the one near the Biltmore of the one on 92nd St and Shea.\nPlus, it gives me an opportunity to use my Spanish!","I love Chipotle and the food here was great.  The workers not so much though, I had to ask for things multiple times and they all seemed to have a slight attitude.","YUM!  I always order a vegetarian burrito with black beans.  I ask for an extra tortilla (free) so I can take half the stuffing out of the burrito and save it for a meal later.","I thought I had reviewed this location already?  Weird.  The one closer to the mall is a total hassle since it is crowded with no parking so it is much better to go here instead (even if you are actually shopping at the mall).  You all know about the food and you either love it or you hate it but I just like this location since there is usually not much of a line, at least in the evenings.","Had an early dinner here earlier today. The food was good as always. That burrito was as big as my head! I had the Barbacoa with extra rice and beans with everything but guac. Crazy yummy! \n\nThe reason why I'm writing this review is because I found this Chipotle to be more dirtier than the other locations I've been to. Most of the tables haven't been wiped down and had bits of cheese and salsa on the (ew) and the soda station had a stack of napkins on it where an employee tried to fill the napkin holder, gave up and then just left a stack of napkins on top of the holder and napkins were all over the station and ground. It was like that when we got there and it wasn't until we were about to leave that they were even cleaned up. \n\nI used the restroom and that was dirty too! With hair and toilet paper everywhere and a very dirty mirror. I was like.. WTF?! The south side location is waaay cleaner than this one!! So much for Chandler being the \"good side of town\" - well... atlease in comparison to the South Side. lol. I unno, the food was great (as are all Chipotles) but the whole place was unclean. \n\nTo my yelpers, if you're in that area - especially the mall, Chipotle is prolly your safest bet for a good place to eat. But be sure to bring some wet naps so you can wipe down your table, you'll thank me later!","Um.  I love this joint.  Seriously.  It's the vegetarian burrito for me with black beans, obv, with lots of that hot salsa!  Mmmmm!  If I eat the whole thing I'm full for a good 8 hours....and my burrito is always so tasty, that yep, I'm full for a good 8 hours.  I wish I had the self control to save half for later.  \n\nI'd give this 5 stars, but I'm kind of a health nut and we all know those white toritillas are def not healthy!","I came here twice, both in different months, and both times sucked.\n\nSoggy burritos does not make a hungry woman happy.","For almost every visit prior to this I'd give 5 stars, but I think because of a few new employees, today the experience was different.  First of all, the guy put the wrong kind of beans on my burrito.  Also, the cashier asked me if I wanted my receipt.  I said, 'No', but she still gave it to me.  My burrito was also smaller than usual.  But as always, it was delicious.  And for the setup, they have an extremely efficient way of serving customers.\n\nTip: Don't be afraid to ask them to put 'a little more rice', or 'a little more beans'.  They will do it and they won't charge extra.","Hello, my name is April, and I'm a Chipotle addict. \nI always get the same thing...one small soft taco with all the fixings and steak, a kids bag of chips (just the perfect amount without going overboard...because if I get the big bag I WILL eat the entire thing). The perfect amount for lunch/dinner without breaking the bank, always under $5. YUM!!!","Always good and fast. Rice is the best, meats are always grilled and fresh.","I did not know a burrito could hold that much inside.","I have recently fallen in love with the vegetarian crunchy tacos! This location serves them up pretty well with generous portions of peppers and onions, corn, sour cream, and lettuce. \n\nI work in the area and my lunch break is usually slightly after the lunch rush so when I visit this location they always seem to be winding down from the busy lunch rush, which means I often have to wait while the employee does something else. Sometimes the \"assembly line\" doesn't move as efficiently as possible...but the place is always clean and the food is always fresh.\n\nI don't know if you know this, but Chipotle serves Mexican and some Domestic beer and margaritas! I didn't have one this time because I was on my lunch break...but from previous experience, the margaritas are pretty good and really strong. Definitely try one some time!","Whenever I want a burrito and don't feel like driving to Rosa's, I go here. More often than not, I'll choose Rosa's, but on some days...well, you know. :)\n\nI used to have issues with Chipotle, but only because it was owned by McDonald's, but McD's dumped Chipotle. Purely on my stubborn way of thinking did I not go.\n\nIt was hint to pass Go. I did. :)\n\nI've been to various Chipotles around Arizona, California and Illinois.\n\nThis one is closest to my home and it's not bad. Sometimes they go a bit crazy on the rice and beans, but not enough on the meat. Sometimes they'll go crazy with the meat, but not enough with the beans and rice. But it doesn't matter, it's so tasty either way I don't give a flying leap.\n\nThe one thing that this Chipotle is consistent with is...dirty. I've come in at different times of the day and different days of the week, and the tables are always covered with someone's leftover rice, guac, salsa, dirty napkins and empty cups...I did slip on a bean, once. I didn't fall because I grabbed onto hubby - if I'm going down, he's coming with! ;)\n\nIt makes me think twice about eating there again, but hell, I lived in India and I survived that whole other unsanitary environment. I can survive anything. :p\n\nSo this location of Chipotle would've gotten 4 stars if it were more presentable.","Love the food at Chipotle. Usually get good portions. This one acts like rice and beans are not that abundant in this part of the country. Asked for a little more..... And got very little more :-(    . Come on guys. Rice and beans are cheap. Any other place uses them as fillers. You should try the same","you cant beat chipotle :) ...always love the place.","Another Chipotle\n\nAnother place to fall back on when your original plans fall through (the wait was too long across the parking lot).\nAnother location in the strategic grid of quick bites that always satisfy the whole family.\nAnother chance to have a burrito with barbacoa, brown rice, pinto beans, corn and hot salsa, sour cream, and that's it.\nAnother chance for my wife to decide between a burrito or a veggie bowl.\nAnother change for my daughter to have three kids quesadillas.  Maybe she needs an adult meal.\nAnother chance to read about the most recent locally bought, sustainable purchasing plan off of a cup.\nAnother change to try and figure out what the black and white pictures mean, and to interpret the message behind the wood and metal sculptures.\nAnother opportunity to have a great meal.","chipotle oh how i miss you. we don't have one in hawaii but this is a must whenever we visit arizona! 5 stars!!! :)","Knock off of FreeBirds in Texas but still good.","This place is the creme de la creme of Mexi fast food for me. I always get a Carnitas bowl with the hot salsa and it is just delicious every time.\n\nI also really appreciate the way Chipotle cares about organic food, especially their meat.","Be careful during the lunch rush, this store will have a line out the door! (For good reason though). All Chipotles use quality ingredients, and have a superior product. In my opinion, this store stands out because of the staff. Very friendly and extremely efficient. I use the iPhone app (ya, there's an app for that) and order/pay from my office. When you get there you can stroll right up to the counter and simply pick up your bag to-go. Nothing to sign, no hassle, and no wait. Can't beat it!! Don't stress accuracy of your order either. I've had zero issues with that.","What, another Chipotle adjacent to Chandler Mall?!  Yes, that's right there are now two Chipotle locations within walking distance of Chandler Fashion Center.  This location is close to the Modern Mommy, Green Table, and Lizard Thicket boutiques and unlike the other location does not share a parking lot with the Harkins theater.  This makes it infinitely superior to the previous location.  I just hope it lasts since this space has had a different restaurant tenant every six months for the last 5 years.","Usually very busy, being that it's between the mall and theater, but great food as always.","So...on those rare occasions I don't feel like Jimmy John's, this is my first choice.  I absolutely love that they only use hormone-free local meats - it is such a fantastic step in the right direction that every other restaurant (fast food or not) should follow.  It may raise the prices slightly, but damn, food everywhere would be so tasty while the environment would get a little break.  Win-win, thus 5 stars.\n\nBarbacoa is my favorite, and I really like that I can choose between black or pinto beans, white or brown rice, corn or flour tortilla, three different salsas, etc.  Great options that don't make me feel guilty afterwards.  \n\nI do wish they had more than just watered down macro-Mexican beers, but I understand that it fits with the whole theme.  Any local beers would be wonderful, especially if they're looking to reduce their footprint even more and continue supporting the local economies.  Plus, it would help each regions' restaurants have a little bit of their own local flair."],"business_id":"x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw","name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","categories":["Mexican","Tex-Mex","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Went to Tony Moreno Salon and had a few minutes to spare and saw Roberto's Taco Shop right next door.  Tried the rolled tacos and they were delicious.  Will definitely be back to try other items on their menu.","Just finished pigging out on carne asada tacos and chips and cheese. Still as tasty as always. Gotta love Robertos!","Hey look in the strip mall, it's a bird, it's a plane! No, it Roberto's Taco Shop.  These places are everywhere and I believe they are all open 24 hours.  So yes when you are having that Mexican food craving in the middle of night after some binge drinking you can always count on your friend Roberto to serve it up.  I'm not saying that's how I partake in this fine Mexican food establishment.  I actually frequent Roberto's quite often in a state of sobriety.  I only have four words for you, are you ready? yes four words that should be famously synonymous with Roberto's Taco Shop!  Wait for it.................! CARNE ASADA FRENCH FRIES!  Senor Roberto took two food items that I enjoy.  French fries and carne asada!  So next time you go to Roberto's Taco Shop at 12:00PM or 12:00AM, sober or inebriated just get the fries!  Cheers!","it's not real Mexican food. the only close to authentic was the condiments bar with the pickled carrot, jalapeño and the sauce. their taco was tasteless and boring, no flavor","Tonight I needed a burrito fix after an extremely long night at work. Roberto's answered my need with a carne asada burrito with just beans, cheese and rice. It was super quick and super tasty. Thanks for helping me in my moment of need :)","Location\nLocated in Southern Highlands, a master-planned community located on the southern side of Las Vegas, on W. Cactus Avenue, a main thoroughfare through the community.  Sits next to a beauty salon.  Lots of free parking.   It's a chain, though, so they're located all over Nevada and California.\n\nAtmosphere\nYour standard \"walk up to the county and order your food and take it home\" or \"walk up to the counter and eat it inside because you're too hungry to wait to go back home\" restaurant.  It had festive colors on the walls.  Bathrooms in the rear of the restaurant.  Lots of wall outlets!  (Which was good because my phone was dying and I need somewhere to charge it!)\n\nService\nIt's not fast food, but you can tell the food is being made fresh to order, so there is a little bit of wait before your food is ready.  The cashier was very friendly and made small talk with me and my friend while we waited for our food.\n\nFood/Drink\nI'm from the East Coast, so we don't have \"real\" Mexican food.  My favorite fast-food chain is Del Taco (think of Taco Bell, but cheaper and you can get burgers and fries to go with your tacos).  So, when my friend told me that nothing is better than Roberto's I said I'd try it.  Decided to play it safe and order the chicken tacos.  Fresh chicken (I'm assuming chicken breasts that they grill, then slice and put inside the tortilla), shredded iceberg lettuce, and an abundance of shredded cheddar cheese on a warm, soft tortilla. Very simple, but very delicious and very authentic.  I'm disappointed that they don't have pico de gallo as a salsa option.  In my opinion, their red salsa was pretty bland and their green salsa was too watery.  But, they saving grace were their pickled carrots.  You think you're eating healthy because they're carrots, but they're not that healthy because they're pickled.  But, they were so good, I kept eating them long after I was done with the tacos.\n\nI would go back just for the pickled carrots!  I gotta learn how to make this at home!","Why does everyone say Roberto's is only good when you're drunk? I heartily disagree!\n\nI love the fact that their tacos are fresh corn tortillas wrapped around the meat of your choice, toothpicked shut and dropped into the deep fryer. Afterwards it's topped with lettuce, cotija and cheddar, and served with really, really good beans and rice.\n\nThe salsa roja packs a decent punch and a good flavor, I find the tomatillo salsa verde a little underwhelming, but a better match for the shredded chicken.\n\nI also really like the carne asada tacos, with pico and guacamole, or the rolled tacos and guac. The tortas are friggin' huge. The carne asada fries are much-talked about but I think that might be one of those drunk foods.\n\nThe breakfast burritos are awesome, especially with bacon and roja.\n\nI would advise staying away from the quesadillas, which are beyond greasy and rubbery. The chile relleno an enchiladas are a bit too cheesy and gooey for my taste, but it's certainly going to be to the liking of others.\n\nI've been to a few Roberto's around the valley and this is the cleanest one I've ever seen. You could eat off the floor.\n\nOf course, being all the way out in the soccer mom suburbs of Southern Highlands, there's nobody on the floor during the prime time drunken shenanigan hours.","I've been going to this restaurant chain for the past four years and love it because of it being 24 hours opened right in my neighborhood. Warning: this is not for those health conscious and is more for those who need a late night Mexican fix and want something better than Taco Bell. Health nuts should just get cucumber from the salad bar or should already be home asleep after a night of clubbing. \n\n\n\nMy go-to meal is the carne asada burrito. My cousin's go-to meal are the carne asada fries (and trust me they don't stiff you at all on the carne asada unlike other restaurants). Before, I would sometimes get the carne asada chimi chonga meal but no longer. \n\nThe facility is clean; they always have a stocked up bar of salsa, lime and fresh cucumber.","When I feel the need for some greasy and thick mexican food..I head straight to Roberto's!! Whichever location you choose, you can't go wrong..they all have the same taste.  I always get the #4 combo plate..2 hard shell beef tacos w/ rice and beans.  Price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give.  I really like the fact that they are open 24hrs also so after a night of clubbin, it soaks up all the alcohol! :)","The food here is fantastic... No issue with the price the only problem is that the drive thru line is long and takes a long time just to get some nachos.i waited in line for 15 mins for nachos but never got them cuz I took off like a cop was chasing me lol!","The best mexican food in Vegas! I'm so glad one opened near where I live, because I'm obsessed with their MENUDO!!! It's a bowl of awesomeness topped with WINNING. I used to think Pho was the perfect cure for a hangover, but Menudo tops that now. Too bad it's only available on the weekends.\n\nThe Carne Asada Burrito and fries are my typical order. The burrito is a good size and is just delicious. The fries are probably one of the best carne asada fries I've tried on the west coast. You get a giant portion with LOADS and LOADS of toppings!","food was really good service was decent\n\ntransfriendly- a okay, might be a little wierd","The Chichen Tacos were outstanding!  The staff are always friendly and  are quick with our meal.   Good Food and Good Service makes for a good timer out!  If only these guys could cook Asian food!  We don't have a good Asian place to eat at here in Southern Highlands!","Good food, awful customer service!\nCashier, young lady must truly hate her job, or life!","You can't beat their $1.00 Chicken tacos every Wednesday!!!! In addition if you're in a hurry for a very filling breakfast thats most likely packed with calories the bacon & egg breakfast burrito can't be beat!","I was really glad when this place opened cuz it was really close to home and what makes it more enjoyable to order something and get it home quickly so it's not soggy or becomes lukewarm.\n\nWell all the times I have ordered from this place I have been disappointed.  The only two times I was satisfied .....1-after drinking, 2-my friend ordered a special nacho for me and I was starving.  \n\nWhat disappoints me about this place (maybe it's just this one on Cactus) is the lack of flavor.  I should not have to add all kinds of sauce or feel like there is something lacking that I cannot put my finger on.  \nSpecially for the carne asada.  It should have taste that excites the taste buds on your tongue.  But...no.  \n\nI've been to good taqueria and I do miss the one in California called Chavez in Hayward.  \n\nSo time to search for a good place, hopefully not too far from home.\n\nMy son would rather eat TACO BELL, and me, too.","This place is pretty awesome for a 24-hr mex pickup place. Not much room for seating and wouldn't really suggest it. Never had a bad meal here, the carne asada tacos and burritos are a safe play, add a lime or hot sauce and you are set. Not much to add about rice and beans which are standard. My buddy gets the chicken chimichanga every time, I haven't deviated from the steak too often.","This place is open 24 hrs the place is super clean and the food is pretty good.","I've always ordered to-go whenever I've been here, and the service is super fast. I love their tacos. Great value for the substance.","Roberto's is the best hole in the wall Mexican food ever! My little monkeys and I love going there for quesadillas and carne asada burritos. Its cheap, its tasty , its kid friendly and its open 24/7. What more could a mommy ask for. Will always be a loyal patron.","When it first opened it was great! But as of late the quality and quantity of the food is lacking. This evening I had a burrito al pastor and the meat wasn't freshly cooked and barley warm not  mention the girl behind the counter has a sour look on her face.","This is a great Mexican fast food joint! The establishment is very clean and is always well kept. \n\nFood is great! Anything carne asada is my favorite here lol (burrito, taco, quesadillas, nacho, fries, etc) It may not be on the menu but if you ask they will make anything with carne asada. \n\nAnother plus is that they are 24hrs so when ever you have that late night craving this place is the spot! Especially after a night of drinking, this food will help you sober up.\n\nFast food prices and they also have several specials through out the week such as $3.99 chicken burrito combo on Monday etc.","It gets 1 star only cuz it's 24hr n 1 of the few things in the area that is. I don't understand everyone's rave reviews of any of them, the food is no where close to good. It's greasy, sometimes slimey, n not close to real Mexican. The only thing Ive found to be edible is the nachos. It also doesn't help that on the few occasions we have ordered from here they messed things up or even not given us food (like the meat when my husband ordered the carne asada tacos). I'd rather go to the taco bell down the street when I want quick Mexican","Good mexican food, especially when you compare it to the other option we always called \"Taco Hell\", but I digress. Good, flavorful food, friendly staff, and a nice range of choices make this my favorite local Mexican joint!","I like this place. its clean and food taste good.\nThey have a really good cinnamon rice drink also!","I go to this location almost weekly because its near my house and my other half loves the breakfast burritos they make here. I have had good experiences with the food served, its the condition of the store- cleanliness wise, that I have an issue with. The floors are usually sticky along with most of the table tops. The windowsills are dusty. The salsa bar is in need of more ice and a good wipe down. The soda machine is a sticky mess and dusty on top as well. If the place is open 24hours, there should be some down time to clean the store. So, I will still continue to eat at Roberto's but I hope the kitchen and prep area are not in the same condition as the dining room.","The food here is delicious!!!! Their service is fast when ordering take out and you can grab as much hot sauce as you would like. Roberto's is open 24 hours every day of the week so it's perfect after a night of partying or just to fulfill those late night cravings. I love their carne asada nachos, fries, and plates. The food at Roberto's is cheap and they give a generous portion of food so you'll definitely have leftovers.","This place is ok, not great but alright. When your hungry for some quick Mexican food its good. But what makes me give this place 2 stars is the lady behind the counter that takes the orders. She always has a sour face like she hates her job!!!","Food was so dry!! It was gross!!","Had a beef chimi at robertos a few nights ago, I was really hungry and its a lot of food. It was perfect and filled me up. The prices at robertos are awesome, the food hasn't disappointed me ever! And the service is usually spot on. Only waited a couple minutes, and they let me customize the chimi and sides just the way I wanted it which is huge for me (I don't like lettuce or tomatoes on anything!!!) Quick in and out transaction, food was really good, and its location and price is good for me. \n4 solid stars","Not bad for a Mexican fast food place in Nevada !!  and like the others have said this place is really clean....","My last visit I decided to stay in and eat. While I was eating my nachos, the girl starts sweeping the floors, started in the bathroom and is headed towards me. I see stuff start flying in the air, I'm thinking \"she's not gonna come sweep that towards me\" well she did. I see fuzz, dirt and whatever else fly in the air around my food. I glared at her, got up and threw my nachos in the trash. Thanks for crop dusting my nachos with dirt you idiot.","I only come here because it's the closest mexican stop from my house and the food is so-so good. It satisfies my carne asada cravings. :-) but the cashier girl must hate her job -- or life. She never smiles and if she does, its a smirk or some giggles, sometimes some eye rolling, even though I was just telling her my order.... I was waiting for her to tell me my total (which created an awk moment) until I asked her, so she pointed at screen instead of just telling me.... LOL customer service sucks here. I hope she gets some more training how to treat customers.","Went here yet again for an afternoon burrito craving. Carne asada burrito, double wrapped with just beans, cheese and rice...my my my was so very nice. Roberto's is awesome for that quick fix Mexican food (not as good as Fausto's but its closer to my house).","I've spent many a night with Rob (that's the fancy name I share with my friends). When you ask someone if they've been to Roberto's, more than likely the response is \"yeah that's where I go after a night of drinking\". I'm here to tell you, you should try it when you are sober so you can remember how delicious it is. The menu is incredibly cheap, $2.05 for a chicken taco! Make that $.99 on Wednesdays!  Here are a few of my favorite menu items;\n\nSuper nachos (no carne) my second favorite nachos in town (peppermill is my first)\nBreakfast burrito- this is a dos manos kinda burrito\nTacos-love them\nTortas-love them too\nI'm not a menudo fan, but I hear theirs is good \n\nI'm obsessed with the spicy pickled carrots at the condiment bar. I given myself many times devouring these. You could approach the counter and just ask them to put a bag of food together, and you really couldn't go wrong.\n\nThis place is always clean. They serve Pepsi products (only downfall here). I love Rob!","The fish burritos, nachos, and combo plates from Roberto's are simply awesome!  A fish burrito contains two big breaded fish planks, loads of cabbage, salsa and tartar sauce, and probably weighs about a pound and a half, and is only five bucks.  The chicken and carne asada burritos are loaded and delicious as well.  \n\nI think the shrimp burrito recipe needs to be revamped, but I can overlook this in favor of all the things that they do absolutely perfectly.  The salsa bar is also awesome, and they have plenty of little plastic cups with snap-on lids to take salsa to go.  It's preservative free and therefore highly perishable, but that is a sign of great quality.  They also have whole jalapenos and pickled spicy veggies if that's your thing, just sitting there for free in a container in a bed of ice.\n\nThe locations my wife and I frequent are both close to UNLV.  One is directly across from the campus on Maryland Parkway and Harmon, behind the 7-11 store.  The other is in a really spotty neighborhood near Paradise and Twain I think.  Definitely a couple of bright spots in what otherwise consists mostly of everyday fast food chains!","The chicken was very tough!  In a whole the food taste good!","I'm only giving this location 3 stars because I love Roberto's.  I have been to this location several times now and it's just been awful customer service every single time.  It's not hard to have a smile on your face while you take someone's order.  I won't be back to this location.","I eat Roberto's a lot and this location had the best chicken tacos I've had from a Roberto's! Yummy!","Chimi's are fantastic.

Their sauces are great, the mexican dish molcajete is fabulous. His margaritas and regular drinks are great. dont miss this place.","Gonna have to up this one star after my second visit.\n\nWent back for lunch with one of my lunch Amigas and it was a good experience.\n\nSalsa was yummalicious and the chips were warm, crunchy, and fresh.\n\nThe homemade tortillas were totally yummy.\n\nI had the Carne Asada w/grilled shrimps.  Steak was thin and didn't have a lot of seasoning, but was T-E-N-D-E-R which is a rare find in a Mexican food place.  Most steaks are tough, and many of them have gristle.  Good to know this one is top-notch.\n\nBeans were good, salad was decent, rice was fairly blah.\n\nThe one knock this time was service - again, like last time, the servers were slow to respond to an empty salsa bowl and an empty water glass.\n\nAbove average joint, but still not quite in the same class as Mariscos Playa Hermosa, which is my #1 Mexican Seafood stop in the PHX.","If  you get the chance to go here, you will never go to another mexican restaurant in town again. The food is probably higher quality than most. The use real mexican cheese instead of cheddar and jack that the others use. It is very traditional, and they have a dish called a molcajete. Its wonderful. This restaurant is  a great find. Dont miss it.","This place is hole-in-the-wall awesome.  I had the shrimp fajitas and they were bomb!  Their refried beans are unique, they're not gross like you'd usually expect - they were flavorful and delicious.  The guac was top-notch as well.\n\nHowever, their service was really, really slow today.  Only go for a work lunch if you have the time to spare!!","There is a good reason everyone else has raved about the molcajetes at this place.  It is probably the best dish to order here and is very good.  I wish they would have given me more tortillas though; I only had three, and it is a lot of food to eat.  You have to chop all the ingredients up yourself, but once you do that it is cool enough to eat after having come out sizzling hot to the table!\n\nMy family ordered various other plates and they didn't seem as jazzed as me about their selections.  My mom had the Pozole.  It was really good actually but the portion is HUGE, so make a meal out of it by itself.  My dad griped that his tacos dorados with shredded beef weren't deep fried like they do in all the taco shops in the the southwestern states.  At least they were a bit healthier this way.  I liked them.\n\nThe chips and salsa brought to the table were good.  I liked the salsa a lot - a nice spicy and smoky flavor.  The margaritas, however, left something to be desired.  They put way too much sweet and sour and triple sec.  Even at $3.50 I think I would just stick with a beer.","I am the Mayor of La Barquita.\nBow down.","The food is absolutely delicious. The corn tortillas are made fresh and the service is great.\n\nThe only thing this restaurant needs is an interior design makeover but other than that it's a great place to eat.","great food...definitely going back....sort of dirty(maybe a bit short handed)....the goat birria was great and the Mojolete too","In Phoenix visiting friends and catching the Springsteen show. We live in Austin and it's hard to find Mexican food there that isn't tex-mex influenced. Wanted to get some birria, so hard to find in most places and almost impossible in Texas. Did a good search, found this place. just took everyone and wow, this place is awesome.   I would absolutely go back if i lived out here, and would love to have this place in Austin.  We had the birria and the molcajete, just awesome. \n\nIf you like authentic mexican food and are fine with kind of a hole in the way type of atmosphere, this is your place. Try it, you'll love it.","I went here because of all the great photos on Yelp, and I was NOT disappointed.  My husband and I both ordered the pork carnitas fajitas.  I don't know if I can order anything else, they were so good.  The chips came out with a smoky and hot salsa.  The fajitas came out sizzling.  There were green and red peppers, onions and mushrooms with the perfectly cooked pork.  Oh my, this skinny girl ate a lot!  I can't wait to go back.  \n\nI am thrilled as I don't like the cheesy Sonoran fare served at most Mexican restaurants around town.","Never again. I was so excited to try this restaurant based on the reviews but was disappointed by their service. First, they served chips with salsa (which was good) but for a party of 5, they served very little. We asked for more and they told us they had ran out of chips. Wait, that wasn't even the problem. I was the first to get my carne asada burrito and our waitress says, \"we gave you extra beans because we've ran out of rice. Is that OK?\" I didn't want to be rude about it but what kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of chips and rice? Oh, needless to say, they served canned soda, and when we asked for another Pepsi...guess what they said? They ran out! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Rosita's place, which is a block down was beyond better!","Delicious hole in the wall! Authentic through and through!!! Try the carne asada quesadilla, enchilada suizas or the chile relleno","Love the flautas from here! They are so moist inside. The lunch specials are a great price at about $5! They have canned soda which I prefer! I hate paying 2.50 or 2.75 for a fountain drink when I usually only have one glass. Service is always good. The only thing I didn't like were the enchiladas. I was really disappointed. It seems like they took a soft corn tortilla put white cheese in it and put it in the microwave. They sprinkle a bit of white cheese on top that isn't melted. I prefer the usual enchilada with cheddar cheese baked and melted cheese.","Read about this place serving a great Mexican breakfast and it lived up to its billing. The Mrs ordered Huevos Divorciados which I haven't seen outside Mexico. It was killer. I had the Chilaquiles (very good) and the nipper had Pancakes, which didn't look like much but were delicious. Excellent homemade corn tortillas proved that the place is most certainly legit, and all at very cheap prices.\nIt was only 10am, so it was an hour or two early for me, but the vibey surroundings made me want to start necking beers, cranking the mariachi tunes and watch the footy.","The place is not high scale place but the food is delicious.  The pozole was good with fresh hand made tortillas.  Chips and the famous salsa.\n\nShop local, support local businesses.\n\nPrices are reasonable from $5 - $11","We had an Entertainment Book coupon and checked their ratings on yelp so we decided to give La Barquita a try. The place is a dive and was pretty much as expected after reading the reviews. It was clean and the servers were friendly and helpful. We decided to try the combos and that was a good choice. There was plenty of food and it was very fresh and cooked properly. The salsa was very flavorful but a bit mild so we asked for some hotter salsa. The waitress mixed some of the Habanera in with it and it was perfect. Their Chili Rellinos were some of the best I have had. Overall it was a nice meal and I would recommend their food to anyone just realize the place is very divey but overall enjoyable.","This place was simply great and delicious. It was more of a serendipitous find. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but this place definitely made me a believer! \n\nI got the Mexican molcajete. I didn't know what it was but seeing the picture I had to get it! Boy was I right! It was so good! It's like a fajita cooked in a stone bowl with simmering salsa, adding extra flavoring to the meat. A MUST GET. my wife got the 7 mares soup. Also very good. A great portion of sweet shrimp, scallops, squid, zucchini, etc. a hearty bowl of soup with a delicious broth. Definitely would eat this when I'm sick,  were I to be that lucky. \n\n--Keep eatin","This was a great find and completely out of my comfort zone but on my quest to find great Mexican food in this state I used yelp and gave it a shot. I was not disappointed.  I honestly felt like I was in Mexico. I had the Carnitas lunch with homemade tortillas which were delicious.","SERIOUS MEXICAN NOM'S!!!  My husband and I stopped here after flying into Phoenix.  It was a bit late but they were more than willing to accommodate us, thank goodness!!!  I was craving good, real homemade Mexican food after being in the Midwest for months with no real Mexican.  This place seriously hit the spot.  Dive restaurant in not so good part of town...so what!! Trust me, you don't want to pass this place up.\n\nThe service is fast and friendly and the margaritas are seriously yummy BUT the MOLE is TO-DIE-FOR!!!  Seriously, I ate so much I'm pretty sure I almost died but the flavor of that mole was so incredibly rich and delectable that I could NOT stop eating.  It was by far the BEST MOLE I've ever had!  The other impressive part of their mole was that the chicken was served on the bone, almost stew style, which you don't see much.  Normally you order mole and it's either shredded or chunk white meat.  The bone-in chicken added to the richness of this dish.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!\n\nDon't miss this place. You'll regret it! I shall return Barquita.  Te amo!!","I am impressed!! Hands down the BEST mexican food in the Valley!! The servers are very courteous and informative. They were more than happy to explain items on the menu that I could not understand. I would describe La Barquita as a family restaurant. It is quiet, friendly, and priced fairly on portions. OMG!! The Molcajetes a la mexicana is to die for!! I can't stop thinking about it. It includes a piece of grilled cactus. Never having cactus before, I never knew it was so yummy! What really makes me feel good about the restaurant is its employees. We were there on a Sunday. I saw the cook take time to sit down with his children and enjoy a family lunch together. I also saw a couple of children come in and give the waitress kisses and hugs. My enjoyable experience with food and atmosphere definitely makes me want to be a regular. YUMMO!","Just off the airport. Place is cleAn and Good Mexican food.I like the fried majora tilapia.","I was introduced to La Barquita by a friend a few weeks ago and was impressed. Mi Suegra is from Jalisco and her cooking has made my palate very discriminating of Mexican food. I went back with her the other day and we loved it!\n\nLa Barquita jumped to the top of my list for all-time best Mexican Food! \n\nThe flavors are tremendous. The Carne Asada was prepared to perfection. The salsa is top shelf. If you want authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place. No frills, just a good tasting meal in a comfortable setting. The service was good too.","I wanted to like it.  \n\nThe salsa that came with the chips wasn't spicy, looked really good, but it was just tomatoey.  \n\nWe had a place of steak and eggs, which the hubby said the eggs weren't all that well cooked and the steak was a thin piece of meat.\n\nAlso had a chorizo and egg plate.  The beans were good, but the chorizo was different because it had pico de gallo in it.  It was a big portion that we took leftovers since the kiddos weren't all that into it.\n\nWe also had the pozole.  The only thing I liked was the big portion of meat.  The broth was more watery than rich in flavor and the side fixins' were a bottle of tapatio, onion, cilantro and limes.  We were able to share.\n\nThe horchata was ok.  I wasn't impressed, but maybe dinner is better?","This little hole in the wall is a gem, although it looks more like plain old rock from the outside.  Don't let the looks fool you.  Took the better half to dinner here last week and she was a bit apprehensive from the start.  Small parking lot, not much to look at on the outside, and really not too much on the inside either.  But the food changes everything.  I had the molcajete, which had beef, chicken, chorizo, some cotija cheese and a nopale.  It came out piping hot in a big bowl with beans and guacamole on the side.  Fantastic.  Even better were the made-in-house corn tortillas served with it.  Just take a little bit of everything and wrap it in one of those fantastic tortillas and your taste buds will thank you.  My girlfriend had the fajitas and from what I tried, they were fantastic as well.   When she couldn't finish hers and we had it wrapped for home, they threw in some extra homemade corn tortillas.  Great place if you are ever on that side of town.  Good food and friendly service.  We will be back.","I agree, the Molcajete was awesome (even for $12). Unlike anything I've had. Great seasoning & flavor. The bottom of the bowel has loose chorizo & steak was tender. My wife loved it too. Margaritas were ok. Chile Rellano was not that good. Super cold Tacate served with lime & salt. Salsa was mild & needed salt/heat added but agree good smokey flavor. Will definitely go back for the Molcajete & Tacate. Solid 4 stars","This is the very very best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Nothing compares. \n\nEverything I have tried there has been perfectly prepared, fresh, and delicious. \n\nThe Molcajetes are to die for. I had the Molcajete de Camaron and my husband had the A La mexicans and we thought they were both delicious. My mouth was watering for my husband A La Mexicana just on the presentation alone. Great place.","Food was good, service was friendly but very slow, no prompt refills... had to ask twice for many things... Fresh guacamole, good queso fundido con chorizo. Chips very thick, roasted salsa not spicy but tasty. \n\nWord of advice: We noticed at the end that they have stuffed churros. If you want churros order them early or mid meal, they were so hot we could not enjoy them : P","4.5 stars for my love of good dive-y Mexican restaurants. \n\nI went to La Barquita a few weeks ago on a Friday night at the tail end of Happy Hour. I have to say that La Barquita serves the largest and best $2 margarita I have ever had. I love to get tipsy for under a fiver. (It's $2, so don't expect top shelf or even middle shelf tequila. This is cheap tequila, but so is the drink. )\n\nService: Sweet and very nice ladies serve you and make sure you are enjoying yourself. Excellent service for a dive restaurant.\n\nFood: Holy mole the food was great. I got the mole enchiladas with cheese. They were delicious. And some good rice and beans on the side. My friend ordered the molcajetes a la mexicana for one ($12). He loved it. He is a sucker for chorizo and he said it was cooked perfectly. He also loved the Mexican cheese, chicken, beef, and poblano peppers that completed the dish. The charro beans, fresh tortillas, guacamole, and rice were wonderful additions to the almost overwhelming amount of food. \n\nMy three favorite things about the meal were:\n1) the chips and salsa -- great smoky flavor to the salsa with good, thick chips.\n2) the guacamole -- I almost ate all of the side guac. It's chunky and seasoned just right.\n3) the fresh tortillas -- I'm a a big fan of fresh tortillas. My best friend makes her own tortillas and I am sure that they are holy because they are so good. These tortillas were just as wonderful.\n\nGo here for happy hour ($2 drinks) and good food.","We went in today for a Happy Hour / Cena with a Spanish Language Meetup group. We enjoyed an amazing event! The Happy Hour items & prices were fantastic! I've been eating Mexican food since 1954, and I grew up on Sonoran cuisine, The excellent appetizers and entrees were unlike any other restaurant I know, and the staff was so friendly, so this was a new experience. The Jaliscan specialties were all staggeringly excellent, and we shared so many plates of them! The shredded beef, house-made chorizo, and salsa were perfectly tasty & original. Shrimp wrapped in tocino? WOW! Some items were too salty. I got a birria burro to go for breakfast, and I'm confident it'll be the high point of my day! Our group unanimously agreed to come back here to sample the extensive menu. You can't go wrong here!","Had a \"get $20 worth of food for $10\" offer online, so I wanted to try this place.\n\nGonna have to give this place a big ole' \"Meh.\"\n\nCompared to Playa Hermosa, this joint is definitely a  3 to their 5.\n\nI had the Molcajete Mariscos (which I also had a Playa) to compare the two.  Playa's version is MUCH tastier and has more food in it.  Less \"gloppy.\"\n\nThe service was a little disjointed (for which I don't reduce stars unless it falls into the TERRIBLE range) in that I had to ask her twice for a couple of things, and she was not overloaded.  My requests seemed to just fall on the backside of remembrance.\n\nThe $2 Happy Hour Maggies were decent tasting, although small-ish when you consider the total quantity of fluid.  They were well-spiked though, as I did get a little buzz from having just two of them.\n\nThe salsa and chips were above-average I think - the salsa both red and a little smoky and chunky.  Chips on the thick side.\n\nI'd try them again, just to see the range of the offerings.\n\nAs people who follow my reviews will notice, I did indeed follow my rule of never giving a highly-rated place 1 or 2 stars after  just one visit.  Can't have a full knowledge of all that goes on there from just a single visit, IMHO.","This place is amazing!!!  This place is the very definition of a 'hole in the wall' and it totally delivers on every level.  I have had the Chile Colorado, Steak Picado, and sampled the Chicken Mole.....all have been fantastic.  And if you like real homemade corn tortillas...this is the place to go.  If you go while they have Happy Hour, don't be afraid to order the Margarita.  It's not  the usual pint sized glass you get at most Happy Hours....this is a legitimate fullsize 'Rita!  I can't wait to go back again to try something new!","I stopped in for lunch, and found this to be like many other Mexican places in the valley - not bad, but nothing spectacular, and not really worth making a special trip to.\n\nI ordered a steak chimi with rice. Both were decent, as were the chips and salsa. Nothing really jumped out at me.\n\nI suppose it's a decent place, but I've been happier at some of the chains like Macayo's or Arriba.","A few months ago, I was fortunate to be in the valley of the sun for a visit. \n\nI live in this cold place up north now. I am cold and I complain about the temperature and the food.\n\nLa Barquita is the food that most represents what I miss the most in Arizona. Warm, unpretentious, inexpensive, honest and good.\n\nIn September I noticed that they painted the walls and got new linoleum and I thought back a few years before and remember Lupe dreaming about new linoleum, since the floor was stained by the previous owner. The new linoleum is a victory for all who love really good food.\n\nOh? And Rosita's? Someone I read actually wrote a review saying Rosita's was better? Are you high honey? Rosita's is a 3* uses store bought tortillas and microwaved a few of my taco plates too many. They have a big empty bar with a couple of coyote looking guys and one of my friends likes the shrimp tacos so I went there a few times but the microwave thing and the atmosphere are a bit rough.\nLa Barquita is a MUCH better restaurant if you have taste buds or some understanding. \nWhere else in town can you get Huevos Divorciados or Birria or gordonoz fritz? This is the place.\n\nI want a La Barquita  red chili pork plate! I can't get it here -they always make it with beef and only a few places I have discovered actually make tortillas from scratch, all of them a cold train ride away.","Not sure what was wrong with me, I noticed that I gave La Barquita a three star.  I apologize for such a low review.  There rice is great, and the food is nothing but quality.  I get the soup, I suggest for those colder days or sick days to try it out.  I\"m glad so many other people tried this Mexican restaurant its not an easy place to find.","La Barquita is THE BEST Mexican food I have had... EVER!  I ordered the Chile Verde and Horchata.  Here's the deal folks, you know you are in for an amazing experience when the waitress tells you \"I just made the corn tortillas this morning... they are fresh\".  If you want an Americanized Mexican food encounter, then pull up a chair at Macayo's or Rosita's and drive right past La Barquita.\n\nI look forward to seeing some other folks chime in on this one!  A real local, hand made, mouthwatering time.\n\nPS $3.50 Margaritas all the time... $2.00 during happy hour.  Beat that Rosita!!","We had a marvelous lunch of seafood tostado grande and grilled salmon with mushroom and garlic sauce.  It was as good as it gets!  Iced tea, cold beer with lime in a salt-rimmed mug --what else is there in life!?!\nYes, it is a divey neighborhood joint.  But the attentive service makes up for the \"comfy\" decor.","So disappointing. After fantasizing about a Friday night dinner out ALL DAY, we decided to try this local dive. We had previously been to Rosita's place down the street and wondered how two Mexican restaurants could compete so close to each other. \n\nWell, I'm still wondring. Rosita's Place was excellent. La Barquita was so mediocre that I spent the entire next day fantasizing about where to go out on Saturday to quell my unsated desire to have a good meal at a restaurant.\n\nWe got there at 8 on Friday. Hours are listed as open until 9. We were the ONLY people in the place other than the lone waitress, one cook, and two old dudes playing guitar. They approached us at one point and asked us if we wanted a song (man, I HATE that--but no big deal, it's a dive.), and we politely declined.  \n\nNo one greeted us when we walked in, I had to go back to the kitchen to see if they were really open.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and service was prompt, once we were noticed. \n\nWe ordered the posole, queso fundido with chorizo, 3 sopes with steak, and a chicken burro with red sauce. \n\nIt was all *okay*, nothing to write home about. \n\nThe queso was literally a dish of broiled cheese with crumbled chorizo, which, as soon as it came out of the oven, started to congeal and we actually had to cut it with a knife.\n\nI had to ask for more salsa because the shot-glass portion that came with our chips was gone in uno minuto. It was tasty salsa, though.\n\nAbout halfway through our meal, the waitress started mopping the floor of the restaurant with very potent disinfectant. I could practically taste it, and she was actually mopping around our feet! Nothing says \"hurry up and get out\" like the scent of bleach in your food...\n\nShe followed us to the door after we paid and, as I predicted, locked that sucker the second we stepped out. 8:30pm. \n\nWell, now I don't have to wonder about this place and I can keep going to Rosita's...","This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants on earth! Get ready for a pretty authentic experience complete with Mexican dubbed movies and sometimes Soccer matches on a small television and sometimes some people who appear to be hispanic in origin actually eat here! :-)\n\nThis restaurant features all kinds of traditional caldos, served traditionally. I like to get the Caldo De Pollo and a big lado de cilantro which I dump in when I get sick. I always ask for a separate plate because the chicken is essentially poached in the broth and I take the skin and bones off on a plate. It is worth the trouble and comes in a huge steaming bowl with some hot fresh tortillas. I have never been able to finish the whole thing all at once.\nCaldo de Res is a big favorite of the customers here, but I must confess I never have ordered it. It comes accompanied with huge sides of limes and onion and cilantro and Fresh Tortillas.\n\nThe Enchiladas here are Estillo Jalisco and come grilled with sauce on top. More like a quesadilla than a casserole. \n\nFreshly prepared Corn Tortillas really set this apart as my very favorite restaurant for a good hearty Jalisco style breakfast! The beans they serve are incredible too! I am a big fan of huevos rancheros but always opt to leave the rice and cheese off of the plate to save room for a tortilla or two. \nTortillas are natural for sopping up all of the eggy saucy beany goodness! Consider having this for brunch with a vegan friend who is eating calabacitas with guac some Coronas. *sigh* -this is the essense of Phoenix. \nThe friendliest staff who you will ever meet. I really grew to love the family who run this place, they are very good people with a genuine talent for food!\n\nFor lunch my favorite dish here is the Red Chile special (again, these are served with the best tortillas in town, and again I leave the rice off of the plate, even though it is perfectly delicious rice)\n\nFor a Dinner date, I really like the molcajette (I think I spelled it right!) because it is big and flashy with lot's of different flavors within. It comes with grilled white cheese and nopalitos, mexican sausages, carne asada and shrimp among other things, homemade tortillas and chunky soft fresh guacamole -you get the picture? Bueno Bueno!\n\nVery rare traditional items can be found on this menu, and the place doesn't take reservations and can get crowded.\n\nThe service is Mexican style -they will not drop the check until you ask them to -because they don't want you to feel rushed :-) totally authentic.  They are happy to bring you the check right away if you ask!","A small place that delivers a large menu,\nUnless its summer you normally find one customer having the Beef soup here.  The soup will make you feel like you are in someone's house, just amazing and served in a very large bowel with rice and tortillas.","Their Ceviche de Camaron is amazing!!!!! Definitely the best in town. Found them on yelp during my break from classes and go any time I get the craving.","Decent food.  Get the molcajete.  Good stuff.  The salsa needed a little more kick and freshness.","I'm now 1500 miles away, and desperate for a place as good as this.  La Barquita, and especially their Molcajete Mexicano, was the place I would take every out-of-town visitor to truly enjoy the best of what Phoenix has to offer.  The chips and salsa could use a bit of improvement, but here, it's the entree's you come for.  Don't let the humble location and bars on the windows fool you, this is the place you want to patronize (full well knowing that I'm truly jealous!).","Well deserved. Delicious food. The chips were crunchy. Salsa was super fresh. Shrimp ceviche was generous and tasty. And the meals, wow."],"business_id":"xdv2kvaZodkWvTSV6pSSpA","name":"La Barquita","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["My friend and I were only in Vegas for a day for a wedding and we hadn't eaten all day. The heat just made our hunger and thirst worse! So we stumbled upon La Salsa Cantina at Caesars Palace and were unsure if the outcome would be good or not. Usually places like this are over priced and the quality sucks.\n\nLuckily, it wasn't like that! The food was so good. The menu is a small to fair selection. Typical mexican restaurants have pages and pages of food to choose from, but La Salsa only had a couple and they were great dishes to choose from.\n\nI had a grande chicken burrito and my friend had street style carne asada tacos. I was indecisive whether to get the burrito or a enchilada stack! I choose the burrito and what a great choice it was. Both of our plates had great portions of beans, rice, and our main entree. I had black beans and my friend had pinto beans. \n\nThe only complaint I have is they didn't serve chips and salsa for starters. I glanced at a table across and they had chips and salsa, but another table didn't. So I'm guessing they serve them upon request. No big deal. Our meals had us full for the rest of the day. Oh, and the bus boy wouldn't stop hitting on my friend! That was annoying. \n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great mexican food. I wish they had this place in Southern California!!!","Sat at the bar and had a lunch while at a conference.  the fish tacos were awesome!  Some of the wait staff was great while others were just rude and gave strange looks.  Sitting at the bar with a friend who was personable we had a good time and chatted up the bartender.  She was great, lots of fun and I wish I could remember her name.  She just was sweet!  \n\nWell tip well and enjoy the fish tacos if you get a chance! \n\nThey had indoor and outdoor seating.","This is a slightly upscale location of the chain. The food is always consistent and they offer vegetarian options which is a  big plus. It is in the quality of Chipolte and Baja Fresh. The food is good for quick Mexican food. I would give the food 3.5 stars. The bar is a great addition and gets the extra star in my rating. Good staff, good food, its worth stopping in if you are on the strip or looking for a  good place to drink/eat without taking  much time..","I hate this place. Everything about it is fake.","I have to give some love to this particular slightly-upscale La Salsa. It's one of the few places you can sit outside just a few feet away from the Strip sidewalk, and all the people-watching that affords.\n\nDo this on a warm night with a couple friends and a round of margaritas, and it really doesn't matter how good the food or service are.","We bought some show tickets and added was a coupon for 1/2 price entree's to La Salsa. Probably wouldn't have gone there if it weren't for the coupon, but the location was really convenient in relation to the MGM Grand. \n\nFood was good, but the best part was margaritas by the yard! And it was pretty darn tasty at that. We ate when it was pretty slow, so the server was there often to check on us. Even without the coupon, it was reasonably priced. \n\nNothing spectacular, but if your a below average joe like me, sometimes it's nice to eat some Mexican food and get a good buzz on without spending a ton. Oh, and you get to keep the yard glass your marg comes in.","I have no idea if this place is a cookie cutter chain but we stumbled upon it after an afternoon of wandering the strip and all of us were ravishing and in dire need of hydration and nourishment. This place more than hit the spot.\n\nThe service was on point, glasses never empty & courteous help all around from the server and other help in the restaurant.\n\nWe had their guacamole @ $8/order, it was good. I like a little more kick in it, but I can understand needing to tame it for the masses. It was not made table side and served in a nice presentation glass dish with hot chips and some decent salsa.\n\nI had the fish tacos which came with 3 sauces, a chipotle, ancho chili and avocado crema. All three sauces were really good but I think I liked the chipotle best. \n\nPricing was average for eating on the strip, about $25/person with tax and tip and no alcohol. \n\nI thought this place is worthy of a repeat visit.","We didn't really want to go to La Salsa, but we didn't want to eat any more white people food, and the Asian food on the Strip is pretty much inedible, so we ended up here.  It's basically a really expensive, sit-down, not-as-good version of Real La Salsa.  However, the decor is nice.\n\nI had a chicken quesadilla, which had a ridiculous amount of cheese inside, and the tortilla part was browned and slightly crunchy.  Very odd.  We also had to pay $5 for chips and 4 types of salsa (the \"Salsa Flight\").  Very lame.\n\nService was terrible.  Perhaps I should've ordered a yard-long margarita.\n\nAlso, it's located inside the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, and it's really hard to find.  Just look for the Anthropologie on the directory/map, and then take the spiral escalator down to the first floor.  Otherwise, you'll never find it.","There are multiple versions of this place (apparently), and this one is tucked into a corner of the Forum Shops.  While the others get roundly negative reviews, this one seems to be good all around - and we had a grand time.\n\nSince it was lunch, they were packed, but we sat at the bar and had good - and speedy - service.  The drinks were decent, and while prices weren't cheap, the food was good, and plentiful.  While it's not authentic, the food is hearty fare, so you can eat up and have plenty to keep you going throughout the day.","I've been here a couple of time for drinks and this past Vegas trip for food.  Their carne asada was really good, but I wasn't that hungry so I couldn't even eat half the plate.  Prices are not cheap.  It may look like a mexican fast food place, but it's not.  Drinks were good.  The bartender was really nice.  I'd come here again.","Located inside Cesar's Palace, this La Salsa is hidden like a gem.  Except it's not.  When we finally found it we were seated on a weird table that was right in the walkway and the vibe was really strange.  It was too hot to sit outside so we went with it.  \n\nBeing on the strip, they inflate their prices, trim down the portions and have some sort of weird drapery on the walls.  They're trying to trick the people who don't know this is a chain into thinking they are a higher quality establishment than they really are.  I had a couple margaritas that were OK and my food arrived all dolled up to appear as if it were fancy.  A long white plate with divided sections contained different sauces but none of the sauces were particularly good.  The food was alright.\n\nI think this place would be more fun outside on the patio with a drink facing the strip and that's probably the only thing I'd get here if I ever returned.  I rarely eat at La Salsa so I have no idea why we ended up eating here in Vegas...","Allow me to start this review by saying that I hate corporate Mexican food chains.  La Salsa and Baja Fresh both used to have fresh meats and produce, but man have they gone downhill over the last decade.  And Chipotle?  Have you seen the South Park episode entitled Chipotle-away?  That summarizes my sentiments exactly...\n\nThe girl and I were hunting the Strip looking for some breakfast at 3pm.  Nothing doing.  The only places that served brunch had waits of approximately an hour... not cool.  So we wandered into Caesar's hoping that Boa might have some unique Vegas brunch menu... denied.  \n\nBeautiful thing is, I can eat Mexican food at any meal.  A quesadilla may not have eggs in it, but meat and cheese and all that good stuff sounds close enough to breakfast for me.  We noticed this small La Salsa situated down the end of a long, nondescript corridor, and figured it was the best that we were going to do before we went at each other's throats out of starvation.\n\nSat down, service was friendly.  This was by far the nicest La Salsa into which I've ever ventured... it was a proper sit-down restaurant.  Of course, the prices were higher to reflect this, but it was still a relative bargain for a restaurant on the strip.\n\nThe girl went for enchiladas, and I opted for the chipotle quesadilla.  Didn't try the enchiladas, but the chipotla quesadilla was fine... chicken, pico de gallo, guacamole, and a chipotle sauce that wasn't the worst I've ever had.  Too much cheese on the quesadilla, which was the same feedback that the girl gave on her enchiladas.  Other than that, all of the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the flavors weren't terrible.\n\nI also ordered a pineapple mojito, which was pretty narsty.  It was a specialty of the house, which meant that it was premade and sitting there in a glass jar so that the pineapple flavor would infuse with the rum... tasted more like a margharita to me, or sweet and sour mix, or something... I hate sweet and sour mix.  It was overpriced too, which chapped me a bit, but hey it's Vegas.\n\nOh, and the bathroom had bugs in it... gross.\n\nAll in all, 2 stars.  The food was palatable if not enjoyable, the mojito was disgusting (but I still drank it for the alcohol content), but the service was fine.   I wouldn't go back, but it served its role in a pinch.  Oh, the one nice thing was that they did have a nice round center bar in the restaurant which had multiple televisions airing college football... a redeeming quality no doubt.  But still, I'll drop my bucks elsewhere.","I was on the strip, after presenting a workshop at the Imperial Palace, and was craving some mexican.  I was debating driving over to the Hard Rock to eat at Pick Tacos or drive to my favorite mexcian, Viva Mercado's.  Then I saw La Salsa was in the Forum Shops.  I remember eating at La Salsa when it was at Neonopolis and enjoying the meal.  I walked in and was this close to walking out.  It did have a weird vibe.  But the waitress came before I had a chance to leave.  So I order my soda and am waiting for my chips and salsa.  I ask and was told that chips and salsa are not free.  Hmm, no free chips and salsa at a sit down mexican restaurant.  I was extremely let down.  The meal consisted of chicken and avacado enchiladas.  The meal was small, without much flavor, and had about a quarter of an avocado.  The meal cost $18.  \n\nNot recommended at all.","Corporate mexican food? Kill me now!\n\nOn our most recent trip to Vegas, my gf and I were looking to get a quick bite and we saw this spot. Here goes;\n\nThe GOOD: The decor is nice, pretty spot. I think that's what wooed us. We sat at the bar, so we were waited by the bartender, nice guy. Quick service.\n\nThe BAD: The food. It's as bland as rice cakes. \n\nThe UGLY: The fact that in such an amazing food city...we ended up here :(","I had no idea this place existed in Caesars. I had no idea the forum shops even went back this far!\n\nI actually stopped in here on my birthday for a margarita and some guacamole with friends. Guac was fantastic, margarita was strong, service was there.\n\nMenu looked standard, food looked standard, place looked like a solid, standard choice for Mexican, but no great shakes.","I had never been to a La Salsa before, but my friend who lives in town convinced me to join him for a bite to eat and some drinks the other night.  He said La Salsa's are located all over town, and that they are pretty consistent.  I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe food was surprisingly good, but the woman serving at the bar was a character.  We asked how her day was going and she replied with \"I am torn up\".  I didn't ask if she had eaten the food.\n\nThe carnitas were very good.  I had a beer.  My friend (a bartender) ordered a drink that required a snifter.  It was funny because he watched the bartender wash his glass in a sink with dirty plates in it and then dry the inside of the glass with her bar rag.  He was grossed out.  I reminded him the alcohol killed any germs.\n\nMy advice is to get a table because what you don't know won't hurt you.","It's just \"OK\".\n\nWe were seated very quickly which was Great.\nWe ordered and got our waters quickly but that's about as good as the service got....\n\nThe waiter forgot our order of Chips and Salsa.  Really?  How hard is chips and salsa... especially when they charge you for them?  And it's not like he was busy... he had 2 tables... ours and one other.  It seemed like he was zoned out on something.\n\nThankfully, he got our orders into the system and the kitchen got our orders out fairly quickly.\n\nFood was ok... a little salty for my taste.... but I was so hungry I chowed down.  \n\nHad the Enchilada Suiza which was good... lots of chunks of chicken and not just cheese so I was happy with that.  The beans were good but the rice was dry so I mixed it with the beans.\n\nI probably will NOT go back to this La Salsa.  It's a chain so I'll find a different one.","32 oz. margaritas to enjoy while walking the strip? Yes, please!\nMy friend and I did not believe in sharing and got 2 separate ones of the lemon-lime margarita-yummy! The service was fast and the bartender was very nice. She was even understanding and polite when we ordered the wrong thing and she had to remake our drinks.\n\nFor two 32 oz. drinks it cost $30. Great price considering the amount of alcohol we were consuming.\n\nNote: Do not ride a roller coaster after downing this...","Go to the patio area, get a 1/2 Yard Margarita (or a yard whatever works for you), sit back and enjoy. \n\n1/2 Yards are $20, 2 for $30.\n\nThis spot on the patio, outside of Caesar's, is perfect for people watching.  And Chuck is a fantastic bartender!  Quick, friendly and full of suggestions and stories.  The bartender that come on after his shift ended (I never got her name), helped us with directions and was very sweet.\n\nMake sure you ask Chuck to make you the rainbow shot!!! :)","This california chain used to be reasonable, tasty and have the best margaritas (you could pick from a myriad of tequilas to try), and I have spent well over $1,000 in vegas tris at their locations with family and friends.   Alas, a few years back corporate made a change to be more trendy and therefore raise prices.  They have made a further policy to no longer take traveler s checks.  When I asked to speak to the manager I was actually refused and he hid in the kitchen and would not come out.  There is a survey on the receipt, so I called it while in the store.  To date no one has retuned my call. Average, overpriced, insincere.  If it wasn t for their foot long frozen drinks to college kids they d be out of business.  Gonzales y Gonzales (At NYNY) uses real white meat chicken in their burrito and charges $4 less.   Oh an La Salsa charges for chips & salsa.  What the?  You can do so much better than a California chain that doesn t care anymore","Great service . A lot of food with every meal we ordered ! Good guys place for sure ! I would definitely eat here again . The enchiladas suizas were awesome !","We used a travelzoo voucher and had margaritas with burritos.  The food was not very good.  Mine was too spicy and I usually love spicy food.  It was that level of spice where you can't taste anything but the burning in your mouth.  Service was lackluster.   We won't be coming back.","I got a deal on travelzoo.com for my recent trip to Las Vegas. I thought it was a good deal...2 entrees and 2 margaritas plus this restaurant was on the strip at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. When we were seated and greeted by our server, we mentioned that we had the travelzoo deal. Once we said that, I think our service went downhill... \n\n--He asked if we wanted our margaritas on rocks or frozen...we asked for frozen. What did we get??? Margaritas on rocks! \n\n--I ordered the carne fajita platter. What did I get??? A chicken plate! \n\nI mean c'mon! Every other table got salsa and chips, it took us a good 5 min to flag down our server to ask for it and to tell him he got our orders wrong. What worried me the most was that it only took them a few minutes to bring out my carne asada platter. I would think that my meat would take longer to cook...I guess not!!! \n\nIt frustrates me when restaurants offer travelzoo deals, groupons, etc and their service changes once you mention it! Just because you pay for a fraction of the meal doesn't mean I should get a fraction of the service. It's ridiculous. No matter what kind of deal I get, I always tip to the full price--so I don't understand why these businesses freak out and think they don't need to provide good service.","If you are going to La Salsa to get a half yard or whatever of a margarita, go to 7-Eleven and get a slushie. The $26 48oz strawberry margarita I got tasted good, but after downing the entire thing, I didn't feel anything. To put things in prospective, the day prior I got a 48oz margarita from Fat Tuesday for $17 and I was good....really good for the entire night.\n\nGo to Fat Tuesday if you want a good margarita to get drunk. \n\nGo to 7-Eleven if you want a good tasting slushie and save yourself $25","Palabra!","I stopped to grab a quick lunch here and I really enjoyed the fish tacos.  Grilled mahi, not fried, nice slice of avocado on them, rice and beans were fine.  Wait staff was attentive but not smothering....","I thought this place was pretty damn good. We were actually trying to eat someplace else and ended up here because the sushi place we wanted to go to wasn't open for lunch. I'm glad we stumbled in here. I think it suffers because of its location in the forum shops; I'm sure they get very little foot traffic walking by. \n\nGood drinks, very good chips and salsa and guac, and the enchiladas, tacos, and quesadillas were all quite good - a step above your typical tex-mex fare. The whole menu was texmex essentially so nothing too exotic but what they do prepare they seem to prepare well.\n\nThe place is pretty small so it's not much of a \"scene\" but as far as strip restaurants go it's fairly affordable and definitely fills you up.","Not bad. It was quick. I got the grilled fish tacos, I'd do it again.  I don't know if I'd make a special trip here, but if you are in the neighborhood it's not a bad choice.\n\nI will say the margaritas might be worth the trip!  They make the mix in-house and you can tell right away. I had 2!","My girlfriends and I stumbled upon this place with a groupon deal. Even though the walk was far from the MGM hotel, it was so worth it!! I ordered an enchilada, and it tasted like heaven! The bartender was extremely friendly. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table. I ordered a blended margarita which was the best I ever had. I just remembered I had an awesome experience at this place. I have two more trips to Vegas this year, and will make sure to stop by again.","Love the Forum at Caesars and after craving some mexican food, I was happy to find La Salsa. We started with a salsa mix of 4 different salsa's-all very good as well as some queso which was piping hot and very delicious. The fish taco's I had were really great. I liked the sauce, the grilled fish with cabbage and huge slices of fresh avocado. My husband had soft taco's, requested on flour tortilla versus corn. Came with three so he got one of each-chicken, carne asada and carnitas. All delicious. It was a lot of food and very tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. The indoor seating is small but we didn't have to wait long. You can sit outside with some misters but wait for the summer months to end.","We had lunch here after shopping at Caesar's.  I had the taco salad with beef and while it tasted OK at the time, I had a severely upset stomach all afternoon!  My wife had no problems with her meal (an avocado and chicken stack) so perhaps it was just bad luck.  The service was bad, the prices were too high, and my wife's $14 margarita was served in a plastic cup.  Meh, no thanks.","This was not a good experience for anyone in our party. Before we could even sit down after the hostess dropped our menus on our table - we were approached by someone trying to take our photograph and then turn around and sell us the print. We asked her nicely to leave us alone - we all had cameras and had been capturing our vacation on our own. She would not take NO for an answer and had it not been for the fact that we were starving, we would have just got up and left. \n\nThe food was not appealing in any way. The salsa was not fresh, the meat tasted pre-cooked, then reheated. \n\nOne good thing - we took some great pictures of the huge stripper mounted right outside the main entrance!","Hmmmm, what happened to La Salsa margaritas!! We ordered a couple of margaritas and it seemed they were made with an overload of sugar. When they were located in the middle of the Forum Shops, they had that very distinctive tart and tequila taste. Now, they taste like your typical chain Mexican restaurants - indistinguishable!! La Salsa please go back to your original recipes and maybe your location - it was much more fun there. Also, your hostess must have been bored lighting and burning matches at the host stand and watching them burn till the very end.","We were looking for a place to grab a few appetizers and drinks after a morning/afternoon of gambling in Vegas and from the outside La Salsa Cantina appeared to offer just that.  We were very wrong.  Six of us walked into the empty restaurant and we were quickly greeted by our server and we ordered 6 Tecates as soon as we sat down.  We then ordered an order of guacamole, queso and the steak nachos.  All of them were fairly tasteless and average at best (I would give the food 2 stars).  So our food comes out and we start eating, but our Tecates are nowhere to be found.  About 45 minutes later we are done with our meal and we ask for our check.  As he brings out our check and notices the Tecates on there he tells us he will be right back with our beers.  I politely told him that it's a little late for that and we just needed to leave to which he replied \"Oh, so you don't want the beers you ordered anymore?\".  The whole exchange was a little mind boggling and I wish I could have the 45 minutes of my life that I spent at La Salsa Cantina back.  \n\nAs we left and were walking to our next destination I noticed a Chiptole.  I have not eaten at this Chipotle, but I am postive that going to that Chiptole and spending 15 minutes eating a burrito and then the other 30 minutes as a handbiller passing out escort service cards to tourists while wearing an orange shirt that says \"Girls Girls Girls\" would have been more enjoyable than our 45 minutes at La Salsa Cantina.","Located in the hotel we stayed at for a conference, this little place was good.  Between three of us we tried a bunch of things over a few days and each dish was great.  It was fresh and not overly salty--which is a complaint I have often about Mexican food.  The fresh salsas were nice too. I didn't like that it was buffet style for the salsas, but that's the clean freak in me :)\nThey did only have two people working for the conference I was there for--so be prepared to wait.","Stopped by here for lunch before shopping at the Forum in Caesars. The food here is not too expensive and more importantly, it was good. We had the fish tacos and wings and they both were really good. We also ordered the big tube of Margarita which was good and felt never ending to finish.\n\nOverall, if you want something fast without breaking your bank at Vegas, come to this place. The service was good and I would definitely come back here in the future if I visit Vegas again.","I'm sure for tourists this place would be okay, but there's better mexican/margarita joints out there. It's touristly convenient yea but i would go somewhere else. \n\nchips and salsa were good, but how can anyone mess that up..... other than that nothing really stood out.","THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!!! The Bartender whos name i dont recall was awesome. \nTheir food is great. the place is a little small but for the location its great will def. be going back to this place. \nOne thing i loved it was Sunday and they were playing FOOTBALL which made that place even better.","Sure, they are a chain. Sure, it is not authentic Mexican Food by a long shot. Still it isn't bad. \nI had a Taco Salad which was humongous! I barely finished it all! It tasted good though and fresh. The toppings of salsa, sour cream and guacamole tasted like they were supposed to! Steven's tacos were tasty as well!\nThe chips and salsa they serve before hand were good too! Sometimes you can be fooled with good chips and salsa and get a meal that is inconsistent and bad but that is not the case here! I have no complaints here."],"business_id":"zIurGzYhoKsmSxFgilVnig","name":"La Salsa","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["Food was ok. Guacamole tasted ok but a menu partner was Cavalo. This company makes guacamole for a living. Is their guacamole really fresh?  \n\nThey sent a mixed message with music, a cross between classic rock and pop in a great Latin atmosphere.  While I know it was Monday night and probably no need for a band, they could have done better with the music selection.\n\nAt 7:00 PM parking lot lights between them and PF Changs were completely out - It's fall reset your timers or check your photocell.","Very good salsa's which is delivered as a trio of a green, red and a smoked. \n\nWith PF Changs next door and a long wait I chose this for dinner. They have a nice selection for any Tex and Mex taste you might have. \n\nThe wait staff is pleasant and friendly which goes a long way.","Great Mexican entrees and restaurant decor.  Excellent service.  The upscale Mexican cuisine has \"Americanized\" the flavor with a few of the entrees.  Overall, great place for lunch and dinner.","Very good tex-mex food.  Our service was excellent and both times I went the manager came over to check on us, and made an excellent wine suggestion!  I had no idea wine went with Mexican food, but it was amazing!  Their veggie fajitas with black beans and lime cilantro rice are an excellent vegan option!  Margaritas are good too!","It is what it is: a slightly upscale Americanized Mexican restaurant chain. If you're expecting \"interior\" food or another form of truly authentic Mexican food, you will be disappointed.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of the Americanized versions of the chimichanga, burrito, quesadilla, or enchilada, you'll probably enjoy Abuelos. They have wonderful chips and salsa: the chips are light and thin, the salsa is mild but offers a little kick toward the end.\n\nThe entrees are large but do carry a slightly ambitious price; most plates run between $9 and $14. Drinks tend to be pricey across the board... $2.50 for a soda?\n\nService is prompt and professional, and the interior is large, open, airy, and clean. All in all, you're likely to have a very pleasant dining experience so long as you recognize you're frequenting a chain restaurant that is to \"authentic\" Mexican food as Olive Garden is to authentic/rustic Italian food.\n\nI'm a fan. I'll go back - their seared tuna, chimichangas, and papas fritas are tasty.","The chicken tortilla soup is exceptional and a great choice for a quick lunch or light dinner.","This was my second visit here at the Madison location. I had the \"chose your own\" enchiladas platter the first time. It was overall decent but nothing special. The enchiladas are drenched in sauce and if you order ones with cheese sauce, it' overwhelming. This was the case this time when I tried the enchiladas de Cozumel. They are listed under the Seafood section but the enchiladas are filled with guacamole and topped with a couple pieces of shrimp, scallops, and drenched with cheese sauce. It really wasn't my thing.\n\nThe side vegetables were steamed and delicious. They provided a much needed relief from the cheese sauce. The rice was white rice with some cilantro and also mixed well provided from extra flavor. Overall I was a little disappointed with this dish. My friend had the fajitas tacos and they looked pretty good.\n\nMy favorite thing about this restaurant are the chips and salsa. They provide a trio of salsa, a chipotle flavor medium, a green mild, and a hot. All of them taste great with the hot being my favorite. The mild one had a bit too much garlic but was still delicious. The chips are light and crunchy (not the thick ones). I like these better although occasionally you'll break the chip in the salsa.\n\nThe service was great and the atmosphere is clean and casual.","Abuelo's is a unique Mexican restaurant.  \n\nIt's not the \"You're the only one speaking English authentic\" type of restaurant.  It's also not a Taco Bell.\n\nIt's somewhere in between.  The typical mariachi-band is upgraded to Spanish language contemporary pop music.  The salsa portion of the expected chips and salsa appetizer are upgraded to a mix-your-own mild, sweet, and hot salsas.  I get the feel that it's a Roman-esque type of grandeur, yet it's a typical Mexican restaurant.   \n\nMy wife had the fajita tacos.  I had a combo platter that included an enchilada among other typical fare.  \n\nAs for the quality, I give Abuelo's credit for making a leap to gourmet type Mexican food.  It's a healthy step above the crummy ingredients and composition you'd find at cheaper places in town.  But it's also not Earth-shattering \"ohmygodthisisthebestplaceihaveeverbeentoever!!\" \n\nI was very pleased with the service.  Our food and drinks arrives without haste, and our server was on top of the chips and salsa situation.  \n\nAbuelo's is a fine choice if you're in the mood for mexican and not wanting the typical bargain-basement type of mexican fare.  More importantly, the atmosphere and the service is what puts it above other restaurants of it's type.","What's good about this  place? Is it the bagged tortilla chips with chemical salsa, the Chi-Chi's feel, or the overpriced, bland food? I went here with low expectations and left wondering if I've ever felt worse about forty dollars being spent.","I went here by my lonesome self on a Wednesday night, it was quite busy but there was no line.\n\nThe interior is really nice, they have murals of Mexican theme on their walls, and the ceiling is like one of those Vegas hotels. Noise level is not so bad either, it's a good place to take a date.\n\nI had better Mexican food that is much cheaper too, but  we have to remember we're paying for ambiance too. I got the rib eye steak with enchiladas and a margarita, there's nothing special about their steak either, ordinary steak that you also get at Denny's. I love their tortilla chips with 4 kinds salsa, the chips are thin and crispy that goes well with the salsas, you just can't stop eating.\n\nLastly I give their service five stars, my server who's name is Madison is really friendly and attentive but not intrusive, my drink took a little longer to come (which I don't know why since the bar is not that busy) but I didn't mind at all because of her positive attitude. She even gave me extra salsa and chips to go when I told her I really like the chips.","Abuelo's is OK. There is nothing fantastic about it. I ordered the Juarez. I asked that the cheese enchilada be beef instead. I was told it would be no problem. That did not happen. It came out cheese. I sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice. Run of the mill service. If you come here just know you're walking into a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.","The place is amazing in it's look inside. Like Janet said you could have a wedding here it is so nice. \n\nThe food was average. If they can step up the quality of food I would return and return again. \n\nThe service was good when I went. They were nice and polite.","Visited while on work trip.  Food was yummy.  Service was kinda slow as we only had an hour lunch break and were late back to our conference.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. Guacamole was delicious.  We needed more chips and they were not refilled until after our meals came... overall ok and I would visit again.","Like the place. I stop in here for business lunch on occasion. Food is good, It's never busy. Kind of wonder how they stay in business - they always seem overstaffed.","Great atmosphere! I love to sit at the bar and order nachos or enchiladas and hang out with my husband. The service and food are good.","The walk in has enough room for a party of 15 or so to congregate and the wood finish throughout the restaurant makes you feel a little cozy.  Since I was just a party of one, I sat at the bar, and was served by a very friendly bartender.  I was able to watch ESPN and keep up on my football talk.  You get corn chips and 3 different salsa types- I tried the green tomatilo which was very tasty a very mild salsa, and the red salsa which had a little bit of heat but I didn't touch the browner looking salsa. For my meal, I got the Yucatan Shrimp Fajitas, it was as sweet savory BBQ shrimp.  I had the lunch special version so my size was smaller.  I didn't mind that but they kept the amount of green pepper and onions at the same amount as the smaller version.  Instead of a tortilla, I used the lettuce wrap which allowed me to have a fresh taste.  I also substituted the beans(rice?) with their Spinach casserole, which was a creamy fabulous mix!  I enjoyed the meal but it was a little pricy.  It was a good treat for me.","My husband was looking for fish tacos. We were near Abuelos so we stopped for an early lunch. We were greeted and seated promptly. We were so happily surprised by the outstanding service from the waitstaff and the chef/manager. It turns out that there were no fish tacos on the menu. He described what he wanted to the waitress and she said there would be no problem,the chef could do it. He personally came out and checked on the request so he could get it right! And right it was, 3 delicious, huge tacos filled with lettuce, tomatoes, pico, and each one had a large portion of tilapia! The tacos were served with lime rice and steam veggies. This meal was more than worth the cost. My chicken quesedilla,lunch portion was also perfect. What a delightful way to experience a restaurant for the first time. Love it! We will be back.","Mediocre food with low quality ingredients.","Mexico sure is a long way from Wisconsin, and I walked into Abuleo's with a certain amount of resignation that it was probably going to be a bad meal.  Well, I got a pleasant surprise and Abuleo's gets a solid 3 stars because I really liked my food.  The dip trio is a combination of 2 warm dips (cheese and chili & cheese) and 1 chilled avocado dip.  For some reason, our group of 5 stuck the dips right in front of me with the idea that table would share, but I kept eating the dips during the entire meal because all 3 tasted great with chips.\n\nI also got the fajita tacos with steak, and the meat was tender and flavorful.  It kind of doesn't matter whether or not mashed potatoes are a Mexican side dish - they were good!  My plate also came with a scoop of guacamole and lettuce & tomato that you almost eat like a salad.  The genius is in the details, though, and the cooks really had their thinking caps on when they did this.  Check it out: my flour tortillas and the warm steak filling would get cold fast if touching a cold plate.  So my soft tacos were sitting on top of a room temperature corn tostada, held in place by a small dab of beans on the plate.  The first time I had ever this, and yet so clever.\n\nI didn't have room for dessert, but if I did, I would have gotten the chocolate explosion.  One person was hoping that it wouldn't come out on the receipt that way, since we have to submit copies of everything in order to get reimbursed, but sure enough it said \"chocolate explosion.\"  She got her dessert to-go, and the next day we teased her and asked whether any chocolate explosion got on her hotel room walls or ceiling.  That question was met with silence.","I went here tonight for a meetup group and the host was very friendly and helpful.  This place gets a solid 3 stars.  Nice waitress, clean and very good atmosphere.  The food is kinda what you would expect from a slightly upscale American chain restaurant.   I had the salmon, veggies and rice-and except for the cilantro in the rice and the cheese sauce on the salmon, you wouldn't consider it Mexican food...let alone authentic. Nothing amazing but not so terrible either.","Ok, it's a chain, and it shows, but our 14-year-old boy LOVED the chimichanga fajitas. Any place where he's willing to venture beyond his \"usual\" fare is a place that I appreciate.","Abuelo's is an expensive tex-mex chain restaurant in an area surrounded by other expensive chain restaurants.  For the price you pay, you would expect great food, right?  Wrong.  The food at Abuelo's is passable, but doesn't hold a candle to any of the other comparable restaurants in the Madison area.\n\nThe meat in my enchiladas wasn't the highest quality, but from what I saw from my companion's dishes, the quality of the ingredients didn't seem to be a problem.  It all tastes fine but is way over-priced.  The menu isn't very interesting, either.  There are a few (maybe two or three) interesting dishes but overall the menu is catered to those with unadventurous tastes.  Although you can get enchiladas filled with spinach or avocado, which is a nice touch for vegetarian diners.\n\nThe service is fine but could be better.  The last time we visited, the waiter was a young kid (probably still in high school) and he wasn't that friendly, although he was familiar with the menu and answered all of our questions.  He was attentive as well.\n\nOne final thing that irks me is the name of this place.  \"Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy\"?  Are you kidding me?  \"Food Embassy?\"  Talk about pretentious.  Maybe if the food wasn't so lackluster, it wouldn't annoy me so much.\n\nAbuelo's is okay but is definitely not a place you should seek out.  Even if you're in the area and looking desperately for a place to grab a bite, there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from.  Middleton has something around sixty restaurants; you shouldn't have to settle for this one.  However, if your friends are big fans of Pedro's and you want to slowly ease them up to finer Mexican cuisine, this might be your first step.","Delicious margaritas! And for a few dollars more it is possible to supersize them! My dinner was bacon-wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and shrimp. It was a treat for the taste buds.  The chile rellenos, two chile peppers stuffed with shredded beef and doused in cheese, were also good.  But, the true star at Abuelo's is the margarita.  Warning: one supersized margarita can make you feel very happy.  Two would be dangerous.","THEY MUST REALLY HATE WISCONSIN\nOkay, so why, when the largest population of immigrants to the U.S. is mexican, did I go to a chain restaurant in the middle of a suburb when you could go to a smaller, less expensive place with better food and eat there?  And who hates Wisconsin?\n\nFirst, it was late (2:30PM), and we didn't want to go too far.  We were staying near the Green-something Mall. \n\nSecond, if there were any mexicans working in the kitchen of Abuelo's (meaning \"grandfather\" in spanish) they must really hate Wisconsin or have originally migrated there from Sweden, 'cause the food was just passable as mexican.  Ah, I see now that in Mexico, our \"grandfather\" never cooks.  I should have looked for a restaurant called Abuela's.\n\nThis place has the potential to be filled all the time because the food is too good to pass up.  It has the atmosphere of a beautiful mexican estate (not farm or ranch), and plenty of room to accomodate people.  I have never been there at night, so I have no idea.\n\nChips - stale, already a bad sign because we were not drunk to not notice.  We were starving, though, so we ate them.\n\nAppetizers - Queso and guacamole - Guacamole was great.  Queso is a preference, but it was little thin and lacked, and I am surprised to say it in Wisconsin of all places, a CHEESE flavor.  Maybe it was too much milk in the mix.  A hint of red pepper and a thicker consistency is needed.\n\nDrinks - Big, quick and good.  Nice presentation, no issue.\n\nFajita tacos - steak meat was nicely served and passable to okay.  It may have been overmarinated, but the plate should be hot and sizzling.  Check my review of Uncle Julio's Hacienda - much better in Chicago.\n\nFixings - about two lbs of grilled onion, two rings of green pepper, no tomato or japapeno.  Mexican beans were great, guacamole, cheese, cilantro were all fresh.\n\nSalsa - thin and bitter, meaning they used stems or it was a bit too old.  It could have been the last of the batch (again due to the late arrival).\n\nGuacamole - the only shining light; it was flavorful, fresh and perfectly seasoned.  \n\nService - passable, but I only got one refill on my ice tea at 2:30PM (1 of 5 tables in this 5000 sq ft place).\n\nWe were the hot, tired, starving people with moola looking to spend  some bucks on amazing food - not spicy, not piled high, not super high quality, but well executed, hot (or properly cold), inviting, simple dishes that people will order by the HUNDREDS and have a line at any time of the day.  At the time we went, I felt this place really needs to work on the execution at any time of the day.  If their lunch or dinner is great, which I expect it would be with all the turnover at that time, then they have to do well at ANY time of the day.  \n\nI think they could really be the BEST upscale mexican place in the entire Madison area and crush everyone if they stick to a couple of things:\n- Fresh\n- Hot when hot, cold when cold\n- Execute the simple perfectly (i.e. salsa, chips)\n- Anytime and everytime","Had a late lunch at this place for the first time last month. It was pretty slow at the time we went. I liked how the restaurant looked on the inside, it has a beautiful fountain when you walk in. \nI tried their Watermelon Margarita and was pleasantly surprised. It was not too sweet or too tequila-y. \nThe chips and salsa that are brought to the table were so-so, fairly spicy. They had there different types they brought to the table and they  mixed a bit of the three on a plate. \nI ordered a burrito and my coworker had the fajitas, neither of us were impressed. My coworker had been there a few times prior to our visit and she was disappointed in how things tasted. \nNot some place I would go back to again. I'd rather drive all the way to Pedro's or go to pasqual's.","So I am in the the Middleton, WI area for work.  I am basically in the middle of nowhere.  I find a gem in Abuelo.  \n\nService: Good\nMargarita's: FAB\nAllows me to order a la carte: Check\n\nVery enjoyable.  I will definitely return since I will be in the area for a few weeks.","I know this place gets a lot of knocks for not being authentic, but the service is good, the food's fine and the decor is interesting.  To me, anyway.  They have this odd mashed potato side-dish thingy that you'll either love or hate.  Chips and salsa are good and plentiful, and I had a superb mojito or twothree here this summer.  \n\nWould I go out of my way to eat there?  Probably not, but if you were paying, I'd say, sure, let's go!","This kind of creepy chain with a very creepy statue that greets you has succeeded in taking all the Mexican and Mexicans out of \"Mexican Food.\" \n\nWhile the balance of salt and fat on the large plate was pleasing to the tongue, it seemed pretty clear to me that nothing gets chopped or really prepared here, just reheated.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the food, but I do not know why anyone would seek Abuelo's out. Maybe the pictures on the menu make people feel safe?\n\nThey are very generous with the chips and salsa. And the flaky light chips are especially addictive.","The first thing I saw when I walked in was a huge, vaguely creepy statue and I noticed that the whole place smelled like bacon and old person.  I chose to eat outside.  The waiter, who was very nice and attentive, asked if I would like the queso with my chips and, like an idiot I said yes.  I got charged $5 for what was basically a dish of sticky Velveeta.  The beans also tasted of bacon and the chicken in the enchilada was very salty.  The quacamole and the rice were quite good.  If you want mexican food, La Hacienda or El Dorado Grill are much better options.","They have a separate vegetarian menu!  The tables are spaced well and you do not feel cramped.  I love the thin chips!  My niece had plenty to choose from on the kids menu and they gave her an entire coloring book.  The wait was only a few minutes while they reset the table (on a Sat. night).  I was out with some very picky eaters and server easily made any changes they asked for.  When they say the plates are hot, they really mean it.","Food is good but not close to great.  Service is very good.  When we are going to do Mexican we usually go somewhere else, for about 10 - 15% less we can get a comparable or better meal elsewhere.  You cant beat the chips and salsa though which why I give it 4 instead of 3 stars.","Ok, I should have known that a restaurant whose full name is 'Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy' wasn't a good place to come to eat after being in Los Angeles for ten years.   I got excited about an enchilada with shrimp and scallops.  I asked if I could get it without the guacamole and her response was \"Then what do you want in it?\"  \n\n\"What do I want in it?\"  Granted I may have been exhausted from lack of sleep and a cramped flight, but I lost all interest in that dish.  My replacement option was ok, Chile Manzanillo with crab, shrimp and scallops, but there was too much cheese/sauce covering up the taste of the seafood.  \n\nIt does get a star for not being busy at 7PM.  Granted, I am used to having to wait with other LA diners when I eat out.  There was a lot of space.  \n\nAlso, the chips were very thin .... felt like they would break under the weight of the salsa.","My fear with mexican restaurants is that at the end, they're just another Chilli's or Pedro's disguised.\n\nAnd sadly, I have to say, well.. this is yet another one.\n\nI think I just must not be very keen on mexican food, and all I'm interested is in a margarita. \n\nAlthough I will say that pretty much everyone else in our party enjoyed the food, so KNOWING my issue with mexican cuisine.... eh\n\nI will give the restaurant 3 stars only because it is LARGE and you feel that you're not elbowing with the next person (or maybe it's because of the high ceilings).\n\nI bet the Middleton peeps are excited about all the progress and development in their area though... Hmmm.","Just opened this month, the place is set up really well.  The inner part actually has lighting that makes it look like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  Right now, I think because they just opened they are incredibly overstaffed, but that isn't a bad thing.  The food was excellent and different from the normal mexican cuisine.  My friend had an avacado enchilada that was amazing...and very different!  My fajita chicken salad with guacamole and zesty lime dressing was perfect, and the latest boytoy had something with an egg on it that he finished completely.  My friend is vegetarian, and there were tons of options.  For dessert we had a dulce de leche cheesecake that was perfect!  The staff was friendly and willing to please, I'll definitely go back! 5 Stars.","Still a solid 4-stars. \n\n+ The table chips and salsas are consistently delicious. The chips: paper thin, light, not terribly salty. The salsas: flavorful with great texture/consistency.\n\n+ Servers are ON THEIR GAME with drink refills\n\n+ Fajita salad - one of the best salads around, in my humble opinion. I skip the cheese and the dressing (use salsa instead) and am never disappointed.\n\n\nNote: I hadn't been here in a while; looks like they've drastically updated the menu (all for the better).","Abuelos was great! Was here with my boyfriend and have enchiladas and queso and they were both amazing! Had the firecracker shrimp and that was the best!!! Felicia was our server and she was awesome! Her suggestions were not only helpful but delicious! Also had the margarita that come in martini glass made with 1800. Best margarita I have ever had! And it comes with a shaker that is equivalent to two full martini glasses!! Definitely coming back!! Sun thru Friday $3 off all drinks too!!","Decided to only review after visiting a place twice. Been here twice. Had fajitas for two, twice. Both times, A-OK and reliably tasty! Chicken was juicy and had just enough flavor, steak was a bit fatty, but typically fajitas have a lower grade of beef anyways. Black beans were fresh and not from a can. Both Green and Red Peppers and onions were plentiful, however both times were warm and Not on a sizzling platter, which is why I dropped a star. It should be steaming.\n\n5 stars that they offer Romaine leaves as a choice to wrap the ingredients instead of just tortillas. Try it; you'll love it, and it's a blast of healthy.","I reserved the private room for my wife's birthday. We had 29 people in our group and the servers did a great job servicing us. The chips & salsa varieties were excellent. Everybody loved their entrees. I ordered the carnitas tacos and liked them very much. The manager came in to greet us and make sure all was well. Again, excellent customer service! We will definitely return.","Had to update: someone must be reading these reviews because the fajitas came out sizzling! Fantastic meal.\n\nWould have been 5 stars but they took the shrimp option off for the fajitas for two...anyone reading this??? ha ha, we'll definitely be back.","I have dined in at Abuelo's once and eaten their take-out at least three times.  I have to admit, this restaurant doesn't do much for me. I think this is because I'm a vegetarian and there just isn't much on the menu for me.   Tonight I had their cheese and onion enchiladas, which were perfectly fine...but I wasn't wowed. Why then, you ask, am I giving them a 4-star review? Well, because it seems as though everyone else who has dined with me has really enjoyed their food. I have not heard a single complaint from anyone else who has eaten at Abuelo's. Their chips and salsa are great - the chips are light and airy with the perfect amount of salt and the salsas taste very fresh and, as a person who doesn't love salsa, I think they are pretty awesome.  My friend who was born and raised in Mexico said everything he tried was really flavorful and good - he clearly knows better than I do.  When I dined in, our server was wonderful, a funny young man (that makes me sound really old) who was did a great job with a bunch of half drunk 30-something women. So, while Abuelo's probably wouldn't be MY first pick of a dinner restaurant, it has proven time and time again that it is, overall, a quality restaurant for those who have more choices on the menu.","I've been playing Clash of Clans a lot, so that's probably why I ordered the Pescadero Guerrero (Fisherman Warrior) in a restaurant I've never been in.  Excellent choice!  Very fresh ingredients in a white wine béchamel accompanied by very fresh veg and lime cilantro rice.  No joke about the rice; if you don't care for cilantro ask to substitute.\nThe salsa is clearly house made and  delicious, there's a sweet, a mild and a hot; something for all.  Quite good.  Excellent chips, paper thin and crisp.\nHouse margarita, thumbs up.  Cavernous place with a good Latin beat.  Service is very good and so is the flan.  (I'm a flan fan.)\nWorth a re-visit for sure.","It's OK, not sure about \"Mexican\" but nice atmosphere and very good service, very clean place.","Hands down one of mine and my family's favorite places! We visit often, and every time the staff is amazing! Very friendly. I would come here just for the spinach enchiladas and the Espinaca casserole alone, if you like spinach, these are a must!","I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I read reviews about this or the neighboring PF Changs. It's literally only about atmosphere and the drinks. The food is beyond bland in my opinion for the price. I've tried the various meatless enchiladas, bean burrito and vegetable fajitas - the fajitas were OK but everything else was incredibly bland( I don't even know how you can make a cheese enchilada bland but somehow it is.)  So again - Atmosphere, Service and Drinks is what this place is all about."],"business_id":"zS5eg7BuZ6iQyGEu5ETpag","name":"Abuelo's","categories":["Mexican","Tex-Mex","Restaurants"]}
{"reviews":["LOVE the Sizzling enchiladas!!! This hard to find location is so good, best Tex-Mex style I have found in the area. My family loves this place!","My husband and I went for dinner and it was amazing! The service was beyond great and the food was even better! Best fajitas we've had in a long time!","I love the veggie burrito they have here.  It is unlike any other vegetarian burrito I've had before.  The service is great and food is fantastic.  \n\nDo want, do want, do want.","I ate here with my Aunt and my cousins, it was good.  I ordered a chimichanga which had beans in it, never had that before and I don't think I will again lol\nI also had a margarita and that was good.","Food and service is always an A plus!!!!! We love coming here! Their salsa is bomb and food delicious! You have to try it :-)","Great food, great service.  We've been here lots of times and the food is always good and the servers are always friendly and fast.  Price is reasonable and portions are just right. Everyone we've taken here has enjoyed it.  Highly recommend!!","We went to Que Mas for a second try. I was hell bent on finding something wrong with this place. My first experience had to be a fluke. Sure enough, I had the nacho's and they were not as good as the steak ranchero...who would have known? Nacho's here are for an appetizer and although large enough for a meal, I will stick to the more traditional and actually order an entree! Silly me!","The chips and salsa are the best thing here that I have tried. Their tortillas are like the ones you buy at the store and their beans taste like Rosarita canned beans. This is probably a good place to go for drinks and appetizers but not so much for a meal. The staff was very friendly. Ill probably go back just for the convenience.","Coming from Southern California, I've been fairly disgruntled with the Mexican food in Vegas since moving here 14 months ago. But despite this place being down the street, we didn't try it until recently, skeptical -- but are glad we did!\n\nThe atmosphere is kind of like On the Border Meets Islands (if you're familiar with that chain) . The food seems to be a mix between the Tex-Mex I recall from living in Dallas and California-style mexican food. It's a little more on the tex-mex side, I'd say, though you can get shredded or ground beef, if beef's your thing.\n\nThe chips don't appear to be homemade, so that's a bummer for me, but they're still pretty tasty. And the salsa is a nice smoky chipotle.  Chips and salsa is a So Cal staple which we've struggled to find here, for some reason.\n\nThe fajitas I had were good, too. Were they may favorite ever? No, but I'd order them again! Their beans are delicious, too. I'm not as big of a fan of their rice as my boyfriend is -- he LOVES it -- but it's also quite tasty.  \n\nThey have a nice selection of items and we've gone back sevearl times now -- once to dine-in and we've gotten food to go from them a few times. Their service has always been really great, friendly, especially the bald-headed gentleman -- REALLY nice and personable.  \n\nGreat, now I want Que Mas for dinner...","Our family loves coming to this place. They always have great chips and salsa. The service is great and the staff is on top of it. It is a family atmosphere where we can bring our children for a nice dinner.","Another wonderful meal -chicken and steak fajitas - quick and delicious.\n\nLarge portions - 2 of us ate and there where plenty of leftovers...\n\nMy friends had a huge margarita and finished it all ~ I drove ;)\n\nService is always polite and attentive!","Awesome, love this place! Great traditional Tex-Mex style cusine, free chips and salsa while you wait and cozy mexican atmosphere. Go here before On The Border!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENED!\n\nNot five stars due to price, they charge just a little much for what you get, but it is SO DELICIOUS!","It's like almost being in Mexico on Isla Mujeres. \nVery comfortable the food is great as well as the service a must go if you have not been here, the lunches a reasonable and filling, plenty of chips and salsa very friendly staff.","Nice place and good salsa but wasn't impressed with my sizzling enchiladas. The waiter was very nice and the service good. I may come back to try something different but nothing real special about the enchiladas unfortunately.","Good Mexican food with family with my auntie, cousin, and future cousin-in-law. Cheese Enchiladas, Chile Rellenos, Carne Asada, and burritos. Margarita was decent. Salsa needed a good kick so we had to request extra Jalapeños.","Just found my new fav Mexican restaurant.  The atmosphere is really great.  The food is amazing.  Chips and salsa are fantabulous.  Drinks are good prices.","Based on Yelp! reviews, we went to this place and were extremely happy with our choice. My gf had the steak ranchero, and I had the chile verde.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  And consider that in LA where we live, we have many choices for Mexican cuisine.  Yet, Que Mas easily stands up to any of them.  The curious thing for us is that we dined around 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday night.  We were the only diners in the place.  Worried that the food quality might suffer because of the slow business, we found that are worries were misplaced.  The food flavors couldn't have been more satisfying.  Give this place 4.5 stars at least.","I saw this dive of a hole in the wall many times and just drove by. I was sure it was a real toilet to go eat at. It is located in a strip mall type property next to Surf City Bar and Grill...another dump, I was almost positive. I got tired of all of my usual restaurant.com coupons and as a last resort I purchased one for Que Mas. My wife complained the entire way there that the last place she wanted to go after work is a trash can to eat dinner, but none the less, we are cheap and we did had a coupon!\n\nWe walked into the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the authentic Mexican look and feel to the place. The person who greeted us (not surprisingly) was pretty authentic himself. We were given a menu and warm, homemade tortilla chips with homemade salsa. Nothing canned about this place! The menu was inclusive, but not over full. It was easy to read and understand. Prices reasonable.\n\nThe service was very fast and we were eating in no time. I had the Steak Ranchero, and it was the best Mexican food I have had since I went to Isla Mujeres, Mexico! I would say that the only thing that wasn't authentic Mexican was the owner! \n\nSurf City Bar and Grill...the \"dump\" next door...is a very nice bar area where they serve food from Que Mas. They are connected by a hallway, but separated so that food can be served in a smoking bar! Very smart! We will be back!\n\nI would recommend Que Mas and Surf City Bar and Grill to family and friends!","Had the carne asada burrito. Excellent service from Ernesto and Gabe. I like the fresh made chips and salsa.","((Nom nom)) this place is soooo good!! I recommend getting the hand-made guacamole! They make it right at your table! Also their salsa is to die for! I got the sizzling enchiladas (mostly because a yelp review at a picture of it and it looked Devine :) ) yummy! I was full from the guac and salsa it was so hard to eat haha yum! Highly recommend! It's location is hidden and it's sort of a hole-in-the-wall kinda place, but in my experience those are usually the best kind of places!","After reading reviews we were expecting a great homemade Mexican meal. Didn't think the quality of food was that great, there were whole tomatoes in our salsa, the rice and beans were not very hot, and my que mas burrito tasted very bland. Won't be going back or recommending this place.","Actually went to Surf city Bar & Grille but it's more a bar so we ended up in Que Mas attached . Well it's mexican food nothing special. Nothing great to talk about. Had to try once won't go back.","Food is great. Chips a lil salty but a lot of food for great price. Server was very friendly","This place was close to work. I got there at 11:30am and had no wait. In fact there was only 1 other person in the restaurant. The waiter brought me chips and salsa and I placed my order. The chips were not fresh. The salsa was homemade with 1 huge piece of cilantro ( about 6 inches) in it. The food came fast and tasted fine. It was served plenty hot. Not an amazing place,but not bad either.","Wow.  Heard about this place from a friend at my last job, but didn't go for a couple months.  Hit it on Friday with my girlfriend.  I'm angry at myself for waiting that long.\nLet me start with the food.  They start you with chips and salsa.  Chips are good quality chips, cooked until perfectly crunchy.  The salsa on the other hand, is out of this world.  It is seriously some of the best salsa I've ever tasted.  I basically filled up on it before my food even came.  I regret this decision.\nI ordered the Pollo Asada.  Chicken was perfectly grilled, veggies on it were delicious, and their Spanish Rice is great.  There were carrots in the veggie slaw they gave me.  I hate carrots.  The slaw was still delicious.  I do not quite comprehend this myself, but it was great.\nGirlfriend went for the Veggie Burrito.  Not only did they remember no sourcream when she forgot (she asked about other dairy items, so they understood she didn't eat dairy), but they subbed the rice too since the rice that came with it standard had dairy.  She said it was absolutely delicious, and a truly unique vegetarian burrito.\nThe server was a truly nice happy guy, they were quick to refill my water, or ask if we wanted more chips (if you see above, maybe too quick), and again just all around nice no matter who went by the table.\nFinally, we both ate for just over $20 before tip.  So, yeah, great value for your buck here.  I cannot recommend it enough.","The best thing about this restaurant was the variety of margaritas.  The food was just so-so at best.  The service, too, was merely average.  I asked for queso dip and was provided a plate of refried bean dip.  We won't be back.","This Place is worn down, the seats are torn and its dingy.  The food is wannabe Mexican, not quiet Tex mex either.  Go somewhere else.","I like the cheesy mexican hut decor lots of seating. \n\nChips and salsa alone is why I make the 30 min drive to NLV.  \n\nI enjoyed the following: Nachos, chimichangas, tacos, burritos. And yes, their chicken wings were good, too.  I especially liked their mess of cheese, fundido. \n\nGabriel the manager and his staff are always friendly.","Not a bad restaurant. Atmosphere and Deco was a little cheesy! Service was very good. The guy checked on us many times and was very friendly. He brought us a new bowl of chips and salsa after 5 minutes. I really liked their roasted pepper salsa. We ordered the appetizer platter and a combo meal, which included a burrito and a taco, plus rice and beans. They were both very good and the portions were big. We ended up only eating half of the appetizer sampler and not even touching the other one. I probably wouldn't make an extra trip to go there but it was a good alternative to the restaurants in that area.","Wow! I have finally found authentic mexican food in Las Vegas! This place is affordable. Service is quick! Waiter always had a smile on his face very good service. Best part of all the food was amazing. I was hesitant to try this place but I decided give it a try and it's 5 stars in my book! The only small complaint is at first smelt a bit of cig smoke since it is connected to a bar. However after getting your meal you forget all about it.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try again!","This place is a hole in the wall, but the Food and Service are second to none!!","Found this on Restaurant.com and figured that since I had a free $25 credit coming to me, I may as well use it here.  Sure glad I did!\n\nFirst - it's part of and connected to the Surf City bar & Grill, so Yelp should actually lump the two listings together.  There's a door and a wall between them, but they're basically the same place.  One difference - you can only use the Restaurant.com coupon in the Cafe, not in the bar area, so don't go after 9pm when the cafe closes if you're using one.\n\nIt's a nice, laid-back surfer/mex type of atmosphere.  Bright multi-colored walls with lots of stuff that reminds you of a beach in Mexico.  Very friendly staff, absolutely wonderful margaritas and a pretty big variety on their menu - I didn't find it \"simple\" at all.\n\nWhen you're first seated, some guy appears from thin air and plops a plate of chips and super-yummy spicy salsa in front of you before your butt even has a chance to warm your seat.  It's that quick.  We watched, and it happened time and time again to everyone who was seated after us.  They sit, guy miraculously appears with chips and salsa, and then he's gone - all within 20 seconds.  Amazing.\n\nGF doesn't do tomatoes 'cause she's allergic, so they even gave us a side of bean dip (gratis) with the chips so she could enjoy them as I scarfed up the spicy salsa dip.  We weren't even to our last chip when they whisked the remainders away and brought us a fresh plate.  Didn't see that coming either.\n\nBest advice from here - get a margarita.  They've got a bunch, none are cheap, but all are delicious.  They don't use margarita \"mix\" here, but go old-fashioned with sweet & sour and triple-sec in a variety of ways, all of which sound great and four of which me & my girl can vouch for as actually being great.\n\nFood is of a surprisingly good quality and served fast, fresh and hot.  Special orders (I hate onions, so no pico de gallo please) were no problem and the staff was attentive throughout the meal.  It wasn't too busy the night we went, but still nice to get a \"have a good night & come see us again soon!\" as we left.\n\nJust a real nice place.  Decor was cool but not gorgeous, staff were nice but not beautiful, food was excellent but not out-of-this-world-memorable or surprisingly different from any other sit-down Mexican place, and the margaritas... well I can't find a single area in which they didn't excel completely.  Best I've had in a while.  We'll be going back, and doing so often.  If I can just get a designated driver so I can try some more of those yummy margies!","This was a one time experience. Restaurant is on the side of a bar. Decor is ok, you get the vague feeling of entering a small village near the ocean...Was seated by a very nice hostess, waiter brought salsa/chips. Salsa is tasty/warm, chips stale. Order very simple combo dinners, tacos/tamales, cheese enchalada/chile rellano. Waiter screwed second order up presented me w/ enchalada/tamale.\nHe corrected his mistake,but took him 10 min, served me the same rice/beans on the original plate. Tamales not home made, came from a box of tamales, that you could buy at Costco or Sam's. So on that note we decided this was not a place we wanted to eat","I've been here a few times, and the food is always tasty.\n\nThat's not to say what the first impressions are like, because the doors are plain, solid wood boards, making you think either they are closed down, or a car drove through their front window.  Seriously, guys.  Get some better doors with some detail on them that don't look like they were made in shop class.\n\nThe service is generally very good.  Today's server took forever to notice that we came in, waited, then eventually seated ourselves, but she was sincerely apologetic about not hearing us come in, and was always around for the rest of the meal, so we were \"good\" after that.\n\nI normally get some seafood related meal, and of all the choices, they haven't disappointed.  The appetizers are tasty as well, as is the chip salsa.  Margaritas?  Well, you can't go wrong with a good tequila, now can you?\n\nPrices are reasonable, and it's never really crowded when I go in there.  The food is flavorful, but not so spicy that you'll end up with a severe case of \"rumble tum\" later.  Just enough flavor to keep it from being bland,  And it works.\n\nAs I've said, I've been over there a few times, and while I don't travel in that area of town too often, at least I know of one decent Mexican food place over there.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't grab a margarita today.  Don't ask why.  I'm still pondering that myself.","I really enjoy this place, its connected to Surf City Bar & Grill, aside from that your greeted by a very friendly staff once seated your given complementary homemade chips with a roasted red pepper salsa (yum). The menu is simple but if your looking for simple this is a great Mexican Cuisine Casual eatery for North Las Vegas. They do have a children's menu and the staff is very patient even with the most obnoxious little ones (my lil guy). My favorite is the Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos with Chipotle Tatar Sauce Muy Bueno! \n\nRecommend for a laid back atmosphere.","Military discount, kids menu\n\nOtherwise standard mexican restaurant.","Ernesto was great. Food was just as good. First bathroom I've seen on this side of town with zero graffiti in. Resturant was very clean. No dust anywhere. Very chill place to eat. Salsa was food too.","Have been twice in past two weeks. Chicken enchiladas were good. Carnitas and Chili Verde were fantastic. Loved the chips and salsa. Some of the best I have had in quite awhile. Will be returning.","Excellent as always!  Great service and food.  Clean and cleverly decorated.  Try the seafood flautas appetizer!","Eh... sadly, the last few times we've gone there/ordered take-out from there, its been less than awesome.  There's something in the ranchero and enchilada sauces, some kind of spice, that they are getting REALLY heavy-handed with. In fact, even the smell of it turns my stomach now, sadly. I can't put my finger on what it is... oregano or maybe cloves?  Whatever it is, it's not a good thing.  \n\nTheir rice has been especially dry and clumpy the last few times we've ordered, as well.\n\nTheir beans are still delicious, their salsa still rocks, but I do think they could pony up for some homemade chips. It's not that hard to make them and it would make their great salsa stand out more.\n\nTheir service is still great, too, but overall the place is just not as awesome as it was for me before. Bummer.","The food was really good but the service was horrible. We got seated right away but waited at LEAST 15min to get our drinks and our server.  When our server (male, quite, hair down) finally arrived he asked if anyone has taken our drinks or orders and we said no. And from there, i was expecting some sort of apology or some sign of \"sorry\" but nothing. \n\nWe got our food and it was delicious. Their dessert was so-so. Our waiter never came back to us to ask us if everything was ok and if we needed anything. He never refilled our drinks. \n\nI was disappointed. It was Mothers Day and she wanted to have a great Mexican dinner. I'll go ahead and say i will give this place another try and hope they dont disappoint again."],"business_id":"zdYxQ6R4pvkqkkr2ER7CrQ","name":"Que Mas Mexican Cafe","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}
