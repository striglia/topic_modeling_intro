Section 2: Exploration!
------------------------


Our goals for this section is to:

1. Use your own code from the last section or (if you prefer or did not finish) this section's pre-built code.
2. Explore the first few businesses in the business_reviews list and think about how you'd categorize their content. What Yelp categories belong? Can you come up wtih any appropriate non-yelp categories?
3. Implement your version of `top_five_interesting_words` function and explore a few businesses with it. (hint: frequency is a good start, but probably not all that matters!)
4. How well can you (manually) guess the categories for these businesses? What process are you using in your head?


All code can be found in this directory. Look at the starter methods in
`explore.py`. The comments should point you in the right direction, but if
you get stuck feel free to ask me or a neighbor for help.


Bonus
--------------
If you're already done with this and waiting for the next section, try
writing a classifier (just a python function!) for identifying whether a
business has the `Mexican` category!

You can see a subset of businesses which are Mexican restuarants in
mexican_sample_bizs.json.

Expert
--------------
In the next section we'll be working a lot with this classifier, so start to
think about what words are important and how to tell whether your classifier
works well.
