Section 2: Exploration!
------------------------


Our goals for this section is to:

1. Use your own code from the last section or (if you prefer or did not finish) this section's pre-built code.
2. Explore the first few businesses in the business_reviews list and think about how you'd categorize their content. What Yelp categories belong? Can you come up wtih any appropriate non-yelp categories?
3. Implement your version of `top_five_interesting_words` function and explore a few businesses with it. (hint: we don't care about words like "the"!)


All code can be found in this directory. Look at the starter methods in
`explore.py`. The comments should point you in the right direction, but if
you get stuck feel free to ask me or a neighbor for help.

If you're already done with this and waiting for the next section, try
writing a classifier for identifying whether a business has the `Mexican`
category! In the next section we'll be working a lot with this classifier, so
start to think about what words are important and how to tell whether your
classifier works well.

You can see a subset of businesses which are Mexican restuarants in
mexican_sample_bizs.json.
