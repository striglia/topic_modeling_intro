Section 2: Exploration!
------------------------


Our goals for this section is to:

1. You can use your own code from the last section or (if you prefer or did not finish) this section's pre-built code.
2. Explore the first few businesses in the business_reviews list and think about how you'd categorize their content. What Yelp categories belong? Can you come up wtih any appropriate non-yelp categories?
3. Implement your version of the `interesting_words` function and explore a few businesses with it. (hint: word frequency is a good start, but probably not all that matters!)
4. How well can you (manually) guess the categories for these businesses? What process are you using in your head?


All code can be found in this directory. Start with the (poorly implemented)
method in `explore.py`.


Bonus
--------------
If you're already done with this and waiting for the next section, try
writing a classifier (just a python function!) for identifying whether a
business has the `Mexican` category! Can you decide just from the content of
the reviews?

You can see a subset of businesses which are Mexican restuarants in
mexican_sample_bizs.json to help you look for patterns. Now try correctly
detecting which businesses in the whole dataset are Mexican restaurants.

Expert
--------------
In the next section we'll be working a lot with this classifier, so start to
think about what words are important and how to tell whether your classifier
works well. Can you write some code to quantify how accurate it is?
